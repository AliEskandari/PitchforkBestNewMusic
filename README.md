# PitchforkBestNewMusic
An personal iOS app to quickly look through all the albums Pitchfork gave their Best New Music award to.

I made this app because I was tired of using the website to look through Pitchfork's Best New Music list. The app presents every album in a sorted (by score, album, or artist) list view. Tapping on an album in the list brings you to a detailed page that has Pitchfork's review, album artwork, and play controls to listen to the album using Spotify's SDK from within the app (linking your Spotify premium account is required before using the app).
