# PitchforkBestNewMusic

The app presents every album in a sorted (by score, album, or artist) list view. Tapping on an album in the list brings you to a detailed page that has Pitchfork's review, album artwork, and play controls to listen to the album from within the app (linking your Spotify premium account is required before using the app).
