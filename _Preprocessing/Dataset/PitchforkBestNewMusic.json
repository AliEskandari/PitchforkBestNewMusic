        "article_text": "Death is the only certainty for rap dynasties. One year it’s \"All About the Benjamins\" and the next it’s Lincolns and Washingtons. Cash Money Records has escaped the fate of the Roc-A-Fellas and Bad Boys thanks to the enduring genius of Bryan \"Baby\" Williams, AKA Birdman. Birdman’s business acumen and A\u0026R smarts carried Cash Money through three distinct eras, from the late 90s Hot Boys heyday through Lil Wayne’s mid- to late-2000s bid for \"Best Rapper Alive\" to the current YMCMB incarnation featuring Drake and Nicki Minaj. (With Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan he seems to be training still another army.) The wheels appeared to come off of the Cash Money machine for good, however, on a random December afternoon when Wayne gave a curt Twitter update on his long-gestating Tha Carter V album, blaming Birdman and Cash Money for the holdup and demanding an exit from the label he’s called home most of his life. He’s since initiated an audacious $51 million lawsuit requesting not only his own exit but that of Drake and Nicki Minaj as well.\nDrake and Nicki have been smartly mum on the split (well, word around town is Birdman was barred from Minaj’s Grammy party earlier this month), but years of whispers about Drake being owed substantial back royalties were publicly validated with the surprise release of If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, a retail mixtape arriving on the six year anniversary of Drake’s star-making So Far Gone. If You’re Reading This is littered with pith for Drake’s label situation (\"No Tellin’\": \"Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open ‘em/ Hoping for a check again, ain’t no telling,\" \"Star67\": \"Brand new Beretta, can’t wait to let it go/ Walk up in my label like ‘Where the check, though?’\"), and all of this surfacing weeks after Wayne’s lawsuit bombshell raises a few questions. Is this release a ruse to close out Drake’s Cash Money deal? Is the absence of Birdman from the mixtape’s lengthy thank yous an oversight or an intentional slight? Is the title a dig?\nIf You’re Reading This arouses many unanswered questions on a business front, but where it truly delivers is giving Drake room to breathe outside of the lumbering commercialism of his retail albums. There’s little in the way of obvious singles here, (though the Ibiza bop \"Preach\" might find a chart by accident). Instead we get a spectral late-night longing not unlike that of So Far Gone touchstones \"Lust for Life\" and \"Successful\". The pre-fame queasiness of early Drake is now the loneliness of a distrustful despot. On \"10 Bands\" he’s holed up in a home studio for weeks pushing himself to create (\"Drapes closed, I don’t know what time it is/ I’m still awake, I gotta shine this year\"). \"Know Yourself\" celebrates the thrill of mobbing through a city that’s his for the taking, but even in joy there’s a note of tension and the ever-present possibility of actual danger. (\"I ain’t rock my jewelry, and that’s on purpose/ Niggas want my spot and don’t deserve it.\") Success creates as many problems as it solves.\nMusic is the real joy for Drake, and If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late is best enjoyed as an exercise in the casual excellence of the artist as rhymer and purveyor of hooks. The vocals are often just vampy flow experiments, but at their best these verses exhibit the weightless exhilaration of a technician at work. Drake’s never more formidable than when he’s shadowboxing, and at its flashiest, If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late feels like his Rocky run. Inspired by gauntlet tosses from adversaries high and low, Drake uses the mixtape to toast and taunt a rogue’s gallery of industry frenemies. For Diddy, who reportedly punched him over ownership of the beat for \"0 to 100/The Catch Up\": \"Real quick, man, you couldn’t’ve hated that/ Let’s be real, nigga, you couldn’t’ve made it that.\" For disgruntled labelmate Tyga, who insulted Drake in a Vibe magazine feature: \"You need to act your age and not your girl’s age.\" For friend-turned-rival Kendrick Lamar: \"They gon’ say your name on them airwaves/ They gon hit you after like it’s only rap.\"\nOn If You’re Reading This, all of this chest beating is delivered over the most darkly hypnotic beats Drake’s graced since So Far Gone. Much of the mixtape foregoes the supervision of his producer-in-residence Noah \"40\" Shebib, but 40’s codeine-soul aesthetic is the ghost in the machine. The PARTYNEXTDOOR showcase \"Wednesday Night Interlude\" matches the OVO signee’s pleading vocal to a chunk of Canadian producer Ekali’s ethereal \"Unfaith\", itself an interpolation of Ciara and Future’s \"Body Party\". Ginuwine and Timbaland’s 2000 classic \"So Anxious\" is sampled twice, soundtracking the slow-cooking opener \"Legend\" and the 40 contribution \"Madonna\". Where R\u0026B sounds aren’t incorporated directly, their thick sensuality is frequently hinted at. The pace of the mixtape rarely elevates past a crawl, reveling in the moody, winding instrumentals and hooky sentimentality of Boi-1da, PARTYNEXTDOOR and newcomers Wondagurl, SykSense, and Sevn Thomas without worrying about posting upbeat knockers to Top 40 radio.\nIn the days to come you’ll read that Drake \"pulled a Beyoncé\" with the stealth drop of If You’re Reading This, and yes, both are surprise releases from A-list artists topping the charts without a rollout or much in the way of an advance warning. But Radiohead’s In Rainbows is the better comparison: Both records found the artists revisiting the mood of a highly regarded early work as they transition into new methods of delivering music to fans. Whether the Drake tape is a clever track dump disguised as an album with the intent of worming out of his Cash Money deal, a deliberately planned gesture to tide fans over until the upcoming Views from the 6, or just an exercise in shirking the protracted waits and missed dates of the retail rap game, If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late winningly employs the occasion of the So Far Gone anniversary to revisit the twilight consternation of Drake’s breakout release, perhaps to close out a chapter of his career on the same note on which it began.",

        "article_text": "Levon Vincents self-titled record, which consists of 11 tracks spread across eight sides of vinyl, is a half-lit maze, an exploration of dance music at its most subterranean. But even as the record reinforces his reputation as one of technos most determined purists, it also suggests that his talents are more varied than perhaps anyone has given him credit for.\nVincent, a New Yorker now based in Berlin, has been making records since the early 2000s, but only in the past six or seven years has become a key figure in the underground. Hes a bit like technos own Fugazi: He has mentored up-and-coming artists, supporting them out of his own pocket, and he uploads vinyl rips of his own releases to SoulSeek. (In fact, the day before this album was to hit shops, he gave it away via WeTransfer.) His records, mostly self-released on his own Novel Sound label, may sell in modest numbers, perhaps a few thousand copies apiece, but sales are only a small part of the story. On YouTube, some of his tracks and DJ sets have been played hundreds of thousands of times. Those numbers might be surprising, even to his fans, given the monochromatic rigor of his music, its single-mindedness. His productions are radically austere and unusually somber—the color of an overcast sky, or a bruise.\nThat hasnt changed, exactly. The music on his debut album is moody and, sometimes, a little counterintuitive. Its not necessarily trying to be difficult, but its intractable out of habit. Drums are scarce, for one thing, at least for a techno record: The four-to-the-floor kick is omnipresent, but for long stretches, the merest hint of washed-out hi-hat is the only percussive element audible. Swathed in murk, these skeletal sounds give the impression of stone rubbings, or a metal frame showing through where paint has been worn away. \"Phantom Power\" goes even further and does away with the low end entirely; for more than five minutes, it is as though the bass EQ has been turned all the way down, leaving tentative synthesizer figures tumbling weightlessly in midair. Which only accentuates the pile-driving wallops of the following track, \"Junkies on Hermann Strasse\", a classic Basic Channel-style clanger as physical and pliable as sheet metal. \"Junkies\" eventually dissolves into a cacophonous delay chain as contorted as Cabaret Voltaires early tape works, but not everything on the album is so relentless or so ugly. \"For Mona, My Beloved Cat, Rest in Peace\" is every bit as sentimental as the title promises; this time there is no kick drum, just hi-hats mapping infinity across a glowing swirl of keyboards and mallet instruments, part Philip Glass and part Rainbow Bridge.\nTheres plenty of \"proper\" techno to be found here; \"Anti-Corporate Music\" comes closest to the dubby style of Vincents singles, with its brushed stainless steel textures and its deeper-than-deep sub-bass. (The title offers a glimpse of the politics implicit in Vincents DIY project. \"This is music for the ugly ducklings of the world,\" he wrote in a Facebook post announcing the LP. \"If youre a member of the rat race…you may of course listen, but know—this is not music for you. This is action against you.\") But nothing on Levon Vincent is merely functional, and some of the best cuts jam a crowbar into club-music convention. For its first seven minutes, the side-long \"Launch Ramp to tha Sky\" unrolls relatively smoothly, just a lively, vibraphone-like lead over swinging cymbals and chilly reverb. Without warning, the beat falls away and is replaced by slack organ riffing, and that, in turn, gives way to a chromatic freakout laced with angel choir. Piling nightly-news themes atop dial-tone fugue, this coda to the coda is as unabashedly prog as a gatefold LP sticky with weed resin; give a medal to the DJ who manages to play the whole side to a dancefloor and get away with it.\nThanks to its pared-down gear list and capricious flow, Levon Vincent feels like the work of someone left alone in the studio, sketching in real time with whats at hand and moving on. And that spontaneity gives it an even greater sense of intimacy. My favorite track, \"Black Arm w/ Wolf\", is, in many ways, the most melodic, with a stately bassline and contrapuntal melody that could lodge in your head for days. The tune is daubed on in broad strokes, left to drift free of the beat—a sure sign that it was played by hand and not drawn across a grid in the browser window. Throughout it all, Vincent keeps his hand on the knob that controls the cymbals pitch, and they rise and fall like swallows at dusk. Its freedom rendered four bars at a time—a snapshot of utopia thats made with dancefloors in mind, but not limited to them. ",

        "article_text": "A young man adrift ditches work mid-commute... a swimmer passes out trying to impress the person in the next lane... a couple goes house-hunting and ends up peering into the life of a widow: These are just a few of the ordinary-extraordinary moments captured on Courtney Barnetts Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit. And like all moments, they pass, sometimes with event but usually without. Not that event seems to matter either way to Barnett, who shows up in her own songs like a bemused local taking questions from a camera crew that rushed to the scene in hopes of finding someone more interesting. \"I had goggles on,\" she notes in the swimmer song (\"Aqua Profunda!\"). \"They were getting foggy/ I much prefer swimming to jogging.\"\nSit is Barnetts first album, the follow-up to two EPs collected on a Barnettily-titled product called The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas. Its music is descended from 1990s grunge, descended in turn from 60s garage and psychedelia—the rocks to the balloons of Barnetts thoughts, which blow back and forth above the distorted guitars buoyed by gas we cant actually see. Without her words, the music would sit there; without the music, Barnett would drift away. Half the time, she doesnt even sing, but talks, slipping into melody mid-line as though she just remembered she was playing music.\nA young writer with a working sense of humor and no apparent agenda, Barnett seems like a throwback to a simpler time—Simpler Times being less a period in history than a fictional place visited through fairytales, Buddhist anecdotes, and characters like Winnie the Pooh, whose creator, A. A. Milne, is sometimes credited with the line from which Barnett takes her records name. An ease surrounds her music, a looseness: Even at their most clever, her songs glide from line to line and thought to thought, a stray observation about cracks in the walls leading to something about the wrinkles in Barnetts own palm, propelled by rocknroll that seems to find itself plenty serviceable but nothing to stop and fuss over. \"I just know what I know,\" she recently told The New York Times; \"I think Im shit some days, and some days I think Im pretty good,\" she told Grantland. To paraphrase the composer and philosopher John Cage, Barnett has nothing to prove and shes proving it.\nDoting too seriously on Sometimes I Sit misses what I take to be Barnetts point: Life is but a dream, tra la la, whatever. Even the albums biggest moments grow from small places, like the washed-up seal corpse in \"Kims Caravan\" that spins out into a meditation on mortality, pollution, what it means to be stewards to our environments and to ourselves—a mental crescendo matched by a band that keeps ebbing deeper into feedback. In the end, Barnett returns invariably to herself, a subject she finds hard enough to understand. \nIf all this seems a little heady in discussion, its to the credit of Barnett and her band—Dave Mudie, Dan Luscombe, and Bones Sloane—that it doesnt sound that way on record. I dont know how things are in Barnetts Australia, but here in the U.S., A.D. 2015, she seems like an anomaly: A young songwriter who is smart but not intellectual, humble but not wimpy, into the past but not theatrical about it, aware of her feelings and aware of how too many feelings makes everyone bored.\nSometimes I Sits most sentimental song is that house-hunting one. \"Depreston\", its called—a quiet, countryish ballad that breaks up the noise around it. Barnett takes us into the neighborhood, into the house, into the sad little details that make her seem like a writery-writer: the picture of a young soldier, the safety rail in the shower. She mentions them once and doesnt linger because she knows theres no point—nothing she could add to the image would make it sadder than it is. Instead she slips into a refrain of how much it might cost to tear the house down and build a new one, which she repeats over and over again, until the memory of the shower is gone. A little life is plenty.",

        "article_text": "Kendrick Lamar’s major-label albums play out like Spike Lee films in miniature. In both artists’ worlds, the stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment. The \"Good and Bad Hair\" musical routine from Lee’s 1988 feature School Daze depicted black women grappling with colorism and exclusionary standards of American beauty. Mookie’s climactic window smash in 1989’s Do the Right Thing plunged its characters into fiery bedlam, quietly prophesying the coming L.A. riots in the process. In these moments, you could feel the director speaking to you directly through his characters and their trajectories. Lamar’s records, while crowded with conflicting ideas and arguing voices, have a similar sense of a guiding hand at work.\nLamar’s new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like good kid, m.A.A.d city did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, \"Wesley’s Theory\", turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. Snoop drops by on \"Institutionalized\"; Dre himself phones in on \"Wesley\". The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On \"For Free? (Interlude)\" an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that \"This dick ain’t free!\" and thunders through a history of black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, \"This money you crave, it’s blood money.\" The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in \"How Much a Dollar Cost\", and closer \"Mortal Man\" ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of 2Pac.\nThe music, meanwhile, follows a long line of genre-busting freakouts (The Roots’ Phrenology, Common’s Electric Circus, Q-Tip’s Kamaal the Abstract, André 3000’s The Love Below) in kicking at the confines of rap music presentation. There’s half a jazz band present at all times; pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard Thundercat give Butterfly a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on \"For Free?\", switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on \"u\" and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on \"You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)\". It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once.\nDespite all this, he’s still toying with a narrative on the sly: Just beneath the surface lies a messianic yarn about avoiding the wiles of a sultry girl named Lucy who’s secretly a physical manifestation of the devil. Kendrick refuses to dole out blame without accepting any, however, and on the chaotic free jazz excursion \"u\" he turns a mirror on himself, screaming \"Loving you is complicated!\" and suggesting his fame hasn’t helped his loved ones back home. Kendrick’s criticisms, as they did on good kid, come with powerful, self-imposed challenges. As Bilal quips on the chorus to \"Institutionalized\": \"Shit don’t change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga.\"\nKendrick’s principle of personal responsibility has treaded dangerously close to respectability politics lately, especially after a prickly remark about the Mike Brown shooting in a recent Billboard interview that seemed to pin the death on the victim, but To Pimp a Butterfly avoids that trap. (Mostly.) \"Complexion (A Zulu Love)\" is a tender note of appreciation for women of all skin tones with help from North Carolina rapper Rapsody (whose slickly referential guest verse contains a nod to \"Good and Bad Hair\"). This is an album about tiny quality of life improvements to be made in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It might not be the message we want in a year where systemic police and judicial inequality have cost many the ultimate price, but that doesn’t bankrupt it of value.\nTo Pimp a Butterfly pivots on the polarizing lead single, \"i\". Upon release last autumn, the sunny soul pep talk came off lightweight and glib. When it appears deep in the back end of Butterfly, though, \"i\" plays less like the jingle we heard last year and more like the beating heart of the matter. To push the point, the album opts for a live-sounding mix that ditches out midway through, giving way to a speech from the rapper himself. In tone, the speech is not unlike the legendary 1968 concert where James Brown waved off security and personally held off a Boston audience’s fury after news broke that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. \"How many niggas we done lost, bro?\" Kendrick shouts over the crowd. \"It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left.\" Underneath the tragedy and adversity, To Pimp a Butterfly is a celebration of the audacity to wake up each morning to try to be better, knowing it could all end in a second, for no reason at all.",

        "article_text": "You had a feeling this was going to happen. After returning last year from more than a decade of light activity, Richard D. James is back with his second Aphex Twin record in four months. If Syro was a masterful summation of the sound James pioneered on his classic 1990s releases, Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 is a reminder that there was always a lot of low-profile experimentation going on alongside the canonical LPs. Rather than cobble together Syro leftovers (it’s fair to assume there are many of these), James draws from a different aesthetic altogether. It’s all there in the title: whatever the process for actually assembling these tracks, the individual sounds do indeed seem to be physical objects vibrating in space, as if James had marshaled a battalion of robots to realize his latest compositions.\nTexturally, the music bears some similarity to bits found on Drukqs, specifically the prepared piano tracks that contrasted with that albums more frenetic breakbeat excursions. \"Jynweythek Ylow\", \"Strotha Tynhe\", and \"Penty Harmomium\" are clear antecedents to the music found here, but Acoustic Instruments takes those ideas further. Piano, prepared and otherwise, features heavily, but so do various drums and wood and metal percussion instruments. And where James used to offer his electro-acoustic pieces as a showcase for lyrical melodies, about half the music here consists of crisply arranged beats, with loping drum lines that occasionally veer toward funk.\nThe most striking thing about Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 (the title is a typical James puzzle—no word of where Pt 1 may be) is how directly his musical concerns can be mapped on to another context. The grooves, the de-tuned melodies, the bridges, the way rhythms can lag a split second behind the beat—all are signatures of his electronic work and all are found here intact. A good point of comparison demonstrating how difficult this must be is Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin, an album from a decade ago that found the new music ensemble tackling some of James’ better-known compositions. The skeleton of tunes like \"4\" and \"Meltphace 6\" was there, but the sense of movement was way off. Here, we can hear the person and the sensibility behind the sounds.\nOn some tracks, you can almost hear their electronic counterparts. \"diskhat1\" features clipped drums with a steady hi-hat and a prepared piano riff that sounds dissonant to the point of seeming alien. \"hat5c 0001 rec–4\" is constructed with similar tools but uses a piano motif from the bass clef to give it the anxious feel of a tightly-sequenced synth. \"piano un10 it happened\" can be filed with James’ most delicate and beautiful pieces, one of those effortless melodies that vanishes into the air right around the time you start thinking about the Windham Hill catalog. Indeed, brevity is key: Acoustic Instruments is the perfect length—28 minutes long, 13 tracks, with about half fully fleshed out and the others serving as sketches—for this sort of treatment. James has a handful of ideas, he comes in and executes them perfectly, and then he gets out.\nIf Syro was a re-introduction for James, a way to put his music in front of people who didn’t know or follow along with his earlier work, Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 is a release for established fans, people who want to know what his pieces would sound like in an altogether different setting. So while the EP feels like it can be connected to other music (it’s easy to draw lines to gamelan music and kinetic film scores), the greatest pleasure comes in knowing where it came from and how it came to be. It’s an Aphex Twin EP more than just an EP, and as those go it’s very good.",

        "article_text": "Björk has logged nearly 30 years of increasing artistic cred and platform-omnivorous ambition, and she has the enviable ability to anticipate sonic and technological waves just before they crest. But her albums over the past decade have underwhelmed, despite their reach and sense of craft. Part of it’s how Björk, as she’s grown as an artist, has grown inward; at her best (parts of Medúlla and Biophilia), her albums come off like slivers of some grand unrealized possibility—undeniably dazzling, but intimidating for everyone who isn’t Björk. At her worst (parts of Volta), those slivers are contorted, Procrustes-style, into the easy templates she left behind somewhere around Debut. \nBut part of it’s the tendency to make Björk into other, false versions of herself: Björk the wayward pop figure, Björk the wearer of the outfits that became memes, Björk the metaphor-smitten New Ager, Björk as the quirky vessel for her male collaborators, rather than the person with complete creative and curatorial control over all aspects of her music. Even Björk the genius, who works in the abstract, disconnected from, as she once sang, \"the exchange of human emotions.\" But for all her classical ambitions and hyperextended metaphors, the best Björk tracks express startlingly direct emotional truths, blown up to their towering real-life scale.\nNowhere is this more clear than on her ninth album proper, Vulnicura. Co-produced by Arca (Kanye West’s Yeezus, FKA twigs’ LP1, his own Xen) and the Haxan Cloak and drawing on Björk’s split with artist Matthew Barney, the album places itself among the most human, emotionally candid, even functional of art forms: the breakup album. Its position is deliberate; in conversation with Pitchfork, she called Vulnicura a \"traditional singer/songwriter thing,\" suggesting something plainspoken, modest, even folksy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Vulnicura is none of these things, but it’s simultaneously her most mature feat of arranging and almost psychosomatically affecting. It’s also, as was widely reported, with us a few months early. While it’d be wrong to say it’s for the best that Vulnicura was leaked then rush-released—no one in Björk’s position would welcome that—the leak does her an inadvertent service: it makes Vulnicura the first Björk album in years to come into the world untethered by museum exhibitions, movie tie-ins, iPad apps, or promo cycles involving Timbaland. We receive it simply on its own iconoclastic terms.\nVulnicura is loosely arranged around the chronology of a relationship: the period before the breakup, the dazed moments after, the slow recovery. It’s a sense of time that’s both hyper-specific—in the liner notes, Björk places each song up until the two-thirds mark in an exact point on the timeline, from nine months before to 11 months after—and loose, with half-moments that span entire dramatic arcs. \"History of Touches\", for example, is a near-forensic exhumation of the precise time of relationship death. The song begins and ends upon the narrator waking her soon-to-be-ex-lover, and Arca’s programming develops in slow motion as Björk’s vocal and lyric circle back upon the scale and warp the timeline: \"The history of touches, every single archive compressed into a second.\" There’s some \"Cocoon\" in there, in the post-coital setting and smitten sigh, but there’s also the unmistakable sense that everything Björk describes is expiring as she speaks it. It’s luxuriant and bleary and sad, something like sleepwalking infatuated through an autopsy. Skip to several months after in the records progression, album centerpiece \"Black Lake\", a masterwork of balancing elements: Björk’s requiem strings leading to Arca’s tectonic-plate percussion and vocal patches, cuttingly crafted (in unmistakably Björk fashion) lines like \"I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions\" giving way to lines far more unadorned and unanswerable: \"Did I love you too much?\"\nWhat keeps these questions from sounding maudlin are those flashes of rueful wit (elsewhere, on \"Family\": \"Is there a place where I can pay respects for the death of my family?\") and Björk’s vocal delivery; she’s at least twice expressed her admiration, at the pure musical level, of fado singer Amália Rodrigues, and you can hear it in how she leans into syllables, indulging feelings then dissecting them. Rarely does Vulnicura sound anything but seamless; her palette blends in drum-and-bass loops, flatline effects, groaning cellos, pitch-warped echoes by Antony Hegarty. The more Björk has grown as an arranger, the less dated her albums sound; closer \"Quicksand\" initially scans like it’s approaching over-timely Rudimental territory, but it’s a little late in the album for that, and this is soon subsumed into a string reverie that’s unmistakably hers.\nIn Björk’s discography, Vulnicura most resembles Vespertine, another unyieldingly cerebral work about vulnerability and being turned by love to besotted viscera, and also an unmistakably female album. Vulnicura doubles down on these elements, from the choir arrangements to the yonic wound imagery of the cover, like Björk’s attempt at a grand unified photoshoot of female pain, to Vulnicura’s echoes from the first track (\"Moments of clarity are so rare—I better document this\") of the long tradition of women artists thinking and rethinking their own life stories, in public, until they coalesce into art. Fittingly, when Björk dispenses with the breakup framework (and timestamps) two-thirds of the way through the album, Vulnicura becomes about more. \"Mouth Mantra\" is part glitchy nightmare of grotesque imagery (\"my mouth was sewn up… I was not heard\") and part reassertion of her artistic identity: \"this tunnel has enabled thousands of sounds.\"\nIt isn’t just her. \"I want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell them you’re not just imagining things,\" she told Pitchfork, and on \"Quicksand\" Vulnicura shifts finally from personal documentation of one person’s rough year to words for those who’ve stayed for it all: \"Every time you give up, you take away our future and my continuity—and my daughter’s, and her daughters, and her daughters,\" Björk sings on the track, just before it cuts off mid-string cadenza. It’s possible to hear this as resignation, but it’s also possible to hear it as a note of hope, that there is a future after coming out of such an emotional wringer, if not quite one that’s reassuring. The ambiguity feels honest.",

        "article_text": "Early last November, a handsome, bearded songwriter going by the name Father John Misty appeared on \"Letterman\" to perform a ballad called \"Bored in the USA\". Blazer pressed, shirt-collar open and eyes shut tight in concentration, Misty, whose birth name is Josh Tillman, sat at his grand piano, that great totem of solitude and opulence, wringing out lyrics so alienated you wondered how he made it out of his yurt, let alone to the spotlit world of late-night TV.\nAfter a line about his own irrelevance (\"By this afternoon Ill live in debt/ By tomorrow, be replaced by children\"), Tillman turned away from the piano and took center stage. Magically, the piano played on without him. Strings swelled, lights glowed with multicolored gels, Tillman put one fist to his hip and pouted like a glam doll—it was all an act, and why should we have expected anything else? As the song plowed into its bridge—\"They gave me a useless education/ And a subprime loan/ On a craftsman home!\"—laughter filled the room. Canned, of course: How could anyone laugh at someone so miserable, and about such shallow, middle-class problems? The audience took a second to decide whether or not they should clap.\n\"Bored\" is one of 11 songs on I Love You, Honeybear, an album by turns passionate and disillusioned, tender and angry, so cynical its repulsive and so openhearted it hurts. Misty is at root a folksinger: Someone who uses natural-sounding arrangements and first-person songwriting to give the audience the impression that hes revealing the depths of his soul, which in a fucked-up way, he is. Because he sings sweetly, you imagine him to be sensitive; because he plays the acoustic guitar, you imagine him to be closer to a naked, more old-fashioned way of life, one in which we might frolic in the grass unafraid. This is an artist whose origin story starts on top of a literal mountain, abetted by psilocybin mushrooms—the story of a seeker in earnest, the kind that sounds even more credible when told by someone who has a beard or used to be in Fleet Foxes. Tillman is both.\nNot all the jokes on Honeybear are as funny as \"Bored in the USA\" and several dont even register as jokes. Tillman often seems to play a failed, bitter version of what you might expect him to be from his headshots—an Andy Kaufmanesque hustler whose seams dont just show, but are constantly in danger of splitting. What should be the sweet story of a one-night stand (\"The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment\") turns into a vicious, nitpicky list of his conquest’s faults, while a bar night (\"Nothing Good Ever Happens at the Goddamn Thirsty Crow\") becomes a tirade against a guy trying to hit on Tillman’s wife. \"Why the long face, jerkoff?\" he spits. \"Your chance has been taken/ Good one.\" For someone fond of glockenspiels, Tillman says the word \"fuck\" a lot.\nTillman is a wordy writer. At times, the music on Honeybear almost acts as a palliative to his lyrics, blunting the edges and keeping the mood friendly enough to get you from one excoriating piece of satire to the next. Fans of the Beatles and Sufjan Stevens will find that songs from Honeybear sit comfortably in their Spotify \"Mountain Drive\" playlists; fans of stand-up comedy will find the album as thorough, sad and bitterly cathartic as any good hour-long special. For all his poetic undercurrents, Tillman is a showman that way: He knows how to get his message across in a form people can clap to.\nHoneybear is conflicted music that leaves me with conflicted feelings. Tillman is funny, but his humor is driven by meanness and self-loathing; he’s sweet, but he can’t manage to say anything nice without smothering it in jokes, like a dog compulsively trying to cover up its own shit. He opens the album by forecasting the apocalypse but most of the time comes off as the kind of mystic who gives up and embraces the debauchery, the patrician in some yoga sex ring, a bimbo Nero who fiddles while Los Angeles burns and occasionally gets sidetracked gloating about how hot his wife is. Yes, he gets high, but he never really leaves the dirty, dirty ground.\nIn the end, his sincerity is a sharper weapon than his humor. Honeybear’s last couple of songs in particular—\"Holy Shit\" and \"I Went to the Store One Day\"—arrive at the strange clarity people sometimes feel in the wake of drug trips, where life’s simplest lessons are suddenly presented to you, quiet and nude: Love people, stay open, be real. Admittedly there are an infinite number of barriers to these ideas, not least of which nobody seems to agree what the words \"love,\" \"open,\" and \"real\" actually mean, but my guess is that Tillman would acknowledge that failing isn’t as important as never trying at all.\nDespite attempts to draw lines between himself and his persona, the story of Honeybear is at least in part a story of Tillman’s own recent marriage, which seems to have slowed his pace and made him reconsider questions of intimacy and closeness, the way marriage can do. The album ends with what were apparently his first words to his wife: \"Seen you around. What’s your name?\"—a question asked without editorializing. A few lines earlier, he had us at the brink of their deaths. \"Insert here,\" he sings plaintively, \"a sentiment re: Our golden years.\" I’ve chewed on that moment for a while now, feeling alternately as though it was a cop out and as though his point might be that trying to compress his and his wifes future into one line would be corny and disrespectful. At least I know he means it when he says he isn’t sure what to say.",

        "article_text": "Before their show in Seattle last month, London four-piece Savages posted a sign around the venue that laid out a couple of ground rules: no Instagramming, no video, no tweets-- in short, \"SILENCE YOUR PHONES.\" This could be seen as a part of a growing trend of bands pointing out how sick they are of looking out into a sea of smartphones rather than human faces (the Yeah Yeah Yeahs posted a similar missive at their recent New York homecoming show), but it felt more like an extension of Savages’ overall manifesto. And no, “manifesto” is not too dramatic a word; especially in contrast with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ sign, which tempered its message with chatty humor (“PUT THAT SHIT AWAY!...MUCH LOVE AND MANY THANKS!”), Savages’ fiery imperative read like something hammered onto a door. \"OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER BETTER WAYS OF LIVING AND EXPERIENCING MUSIC,” they wrote (caps theirs). “WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF PHONES DURING A GIG PREVENTS ALL OF US FROM TOTALLY IMMERSING OURSELVES.\" Ironically, their ability to see the value of silence in a world of noise might make Savages the most web-savvy band of the year. People have been tweeting and tumbling about their live shows the way that people used to talk about live shows: something you just have to see for yourself.\nIf youve paid even the slightest attention to Savages in the year leading up to their debut Silence Yourself, you know that this is how they do things-- in fact, its very likely you knew something about their philosophy before you heard a note of their music. Whether you find it profoundly refreshing or a little tedious that Savages draw lines in the sand, none of this would be worth mentioning if the music didn’t live up to the force of the message. Silence Yourself proves that Savages are more than just talk. Its one of rock’s most commanding and ferociously poised debuts in recent years, the work of a band whose outsized confidence and sharp clarity of vision doesn’t correlate with the short amount of time it’s been together.\nSavages music feels out of step with current trends-- which Im sure theyd take as a compliment. With its tumbling, tom-heavy percussion, singer  Jehnny Beths Siouxsie-summoning battle cries, and the compositional emphasis placed on Ayse Hassan’s bass (in the moments when Beth is silent, the bass feels like Savages’ lead singer), post-punk is Silence Yourself’s most obvious sonic reference point. And it doesn’t matter that they missed the post-punk revival by about a decade. While the bands that dominated indie rock in the early aughts looked to Joy Division and Gang of Four for reasons that had mostly to do with rhythm, Savages’ music finds kinship with post-punk’s oppositional politics, thematic darkness, and anxiety about the dehumanizing effects of technology-- the spirit is the same, but it’s been adjusted to reflect the times. Savages’ distaste for experiencing life through a screen comes from the same place as, say, Wire’s sardonic take on viewers whose idea of adventure was living vicariously through “the Lone Ranger”; after all, if “Ex Lion Tamer” were written today, it’d probably go, “Stay glued to your iPhone.”\nWhich is not to say that Savages are writing scathing songs about shitty service providers; their lyrics are boldly stark, elemental, and timeless. (The titles alone hit with a blunt force: “She Will”, “Hit Me”, “No Face”, “Shut Up.”) Beth has said that the band’s writing process is less about addition than subtraction, paring each song down to its most essential shape. All of the best songs on Silence Yourself derive their power from this kind of focused intensity, from the driving, dissonant “City’s Full” to the creeping, percussive lurch of “I Am Here”. The chorus of “Husbands”, a phenomenal single first released last year, sharpens that focus down to a single word. “I woke up and saw the face of a guy/ I don’t know who he is,” Beth sings in the song’s paranoia-inducing opening moments. A Savages song is about challenging the ideas, words and desires we consider “normal”, and they’ve found that repetition is an effective way to get that point across. “Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands,” Beth chants in a manic whisper; with each intonation, the meaning erodes from a word that’s ostensibly meant to evoke comfort, protection and familiarity until it feels faceless. \nSavages really show promise and range on the slow-burners. The moody dirge \"Waiting for a Sign\" and goth-cabaret closer \"Marshall Dear\" arent the most immediate songs on the record, but over repeated listens, they bloom. If Hassan and Faye Miltons punishing rhythm section takes the helm on the more frantic numbers, Savages downtempo moments allow Gemma Thompson and her scuzzy Fender to shine. On the excellent \"Strife,\" she holds back as often as she strikes, underscoring Beths most brutal lines with perfectly timed jolts and filling the songs winding corriders with thick plumes of distortion.\nThe mix allows each band member’s contribution to smolder with equal intensity and lends a palpable physicality to Savages’ sound. Milton handles her toms and bass drum like a boxer going at a punching bag; Hassan’s bass strings pulsate like a throbbing tendons; Thompson’s guitar cuts with a goosebump-inducing tone that recalls a chainsaw, and Beth shrieks like she’s resetting her own bones. Combining in a constant pendulum swing between tension and release, it all provides the perfect atmosphere for the darkly sensual themes that Silence Yourself explores.\nAs a lyricist, Beth says she’s inspired by the “awkward places” from which “twisted, original desires” spring. “Hit Me”, a sub-two-minute tornado of squalling noise, isn’t about domestic abuse, as some people assume, but is instead about a consensual encounter described by the porn star Belladonna. (Beth: “I hate it when women are turned into victims.”) Savages might make political pronouncements in interviews and on album covers, but their songs come from a lived-in perspective as Beth inhabits her different characters’ states of mind-- and forces the listener to do the same.\n\"How old are you, really?\" a voice asks in the opening seconds of the album; it hovers in the air without an answer. It might be a knowing sneer at critics who think Savages are just recycling post-punk’s signature sound, but ostensibly it’s also a salute to an artistic kindred spirit. The line is from Opening Night, a 1977 movie by John Cassavetes-- a filmmaker who also saw a kind of beauty in emotional brutality and was prone to spouting off humanist manifestos. “My films are expressive of a culture that has had the possibility of attaining material fulfillment while at the same time finding itself unable to accomplish the simple business of conducting human lives,” he said. “What is needed is reassurance in human emotions; a re-evaluation of our emotional capacities.” Substitute “films” for “songs” and those words could almost be lifted off the cover of Silence Yourself. The album cuts through a world of chatter and distraction because it practices what it preaches, transmitting its message directly through the primal, bone-rattling force of its songs.",

        "article_text": "The great irony about bringing a new life into this world is you start worrying a lot more about death. Not just that of the family members you must provide for and protect, but your own, as well. Plain and simple, the first rule of parenting is: don’t die. When entrusted with the immense obligation of caring for a child, even the youngest of new parents become exceedingly conscious of their own mortality and survival instincts. Behaviors once taken for granted—like, say, air travel or cycling alongside cars on city streets—start to feel more like roulette games wagered with your life; once-considered activities like bungee jumping and skydiving get transferred from your bucket list to a \"fuck that\" list. \nYou could hear that sort of uneasiness gradually seep into the seemingly serene work of Noah Lennox—a.k.a. Panda Bear—over the past decade, both without and within Animal Collective. As the first A.C. member to become a parent, Lennox has become increasingly fond of rooting his boundless sonic exploration in meditations on home life, whether cheekily celebrating the drudgery of domesticity (\"Chores\"), eulogizing the family dog (\"Derek\"), making heartfelt affirmations of paternal duty (\"My Girls\"), or openly fretting over his shortcomings as a breadwinner (“Alsatian Darn”). And though he’s avoided explicitly ecclesiastical language in his solo work since writing 2004’s psych-folk hymnal Young Prayer for his late father, each Panda Bear record released since has retained the form and feel of a communal church service: They welcome us in with reassuring proverbs (\"try to remember always, always to have a good time\") couched in heaven-sent harmonies, provide a sense comfort in the face of encroaching chaos, and strive to connect our physical world to a more celestial plane. And be it the psychedelic pop sprawl of 2007’s Person Pitch or the dub-like lurch of 2011’s Tomboy, a Panda Bear record ultimately requires a test of faith, a belief that Lennox’s beaming voice will guide us safely through the dense, phantasmagoric fog that threatens to consume it. In Lennox’s cathedral of sound, you can always see the stormy skies creeping in view through the radiant stained-glass windows.\nOn his latest venture, the tension between inner peace and external pressure reaches boss-battle proportions. Lifting its main-event billing from old King Tubby records, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper serves a similar function for its creator as Slasher Flicks did for Avey Tare—it’s a playful, fantastical response to some serious life changes. In Portner’s case, it was divorce and strep throat; for Lennox, it’s the entry into middle age and the substantial familial responsibilities that go with it. In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Lennox pondered the possibility of retiring the Panda Bear moniker, which makes sense—part of getting older is doing away with your old college nicknames. But if that is indeed the case, Panda Bear is not going down without a fight.\nMore streamlined than Person Pitch and more rhythmically robust than Tomboy, Grim Reaper is Panda Bear’s toughest, grimiest, and funkiest album to date. But all that extra grit and groove doesn’t come at the expense Lennox’s unmistakable melodic graces, which still provide each song with its pulse. As to be expected from an album co-produced with Tomboy holdover Pete Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom of 80s psych-punk patriarchs the Spacemen 3) and reportedly inspired by classic 90s boom-bap beat construction, Grim Reaper achieves just the right balance of skull-splitting drone and head-noddin’ drive. In contrast to the unpredictably amorphous song structures that defined previous Panda Bear records, many of the songs on Grim Reaper lock into a looped beat and rarely waver course. However, they’re often prefaced by or dissolve into ominous, buzzing oscillations (some of which, like the half-minute \"Davy Jones Locker\", are portioned off into stand-alone tracks) that suggest the onset of a panic attack or some shadowy predator. As such, the midnight-marauding march of lead single \"Mr Noah\" and electro-fuzzed yodeling of \"Boys Latin\" are transformed into weapons of retaliation—a strobe-lit assault on the encroaching bleakness. \"Dark cloud has descended again,\" Lennox sings on the chorus of the latter song, but his elated vocal thrusts the black mass back up into the stratosphere.\nLennox told Pitchfork last fall that, despite all the personal rumination that inspired Grim Reaper, he wanted to keep his lyrics purposefully non-specific and relatable. But for all its booming breaks and future-shocked freneticism, Grim Reaper—like all Panda Bear records—remains a highly insular experience, one where it often sounds as if Lennox is speaking into a mirror. \"So good, you’ve got it so good,\" he sings overtop the blissed-out shuffle of \"Crosswords\"—a simple statement of fact from a happily married father of two who lives in a cosmopolitan coastal European city in between sold-out tours. But his wistful delivery betrays the fear of losing it all. And Lennox spends much of the seven-minute \"Come to Your Senses\" repeating a question (\"Are you mad?\") for which there is only one logical answer (\"Yeah, I’m mad\"), as the song’s shantytown acid-house throb mediates between serenity and insanity. A sobering aftershock arrives in the form of late-album wake-up call \"Selfish Gene\"—a sort-of post-rave \"Thats Not Me\"—where the incessant synth-jabs provide Lennox with needling reminders of his family-man mission (\"When it comes to fill those spaces/ Only you can fill those spaces\").\nTaken as a whole, Grim Reaper feels like a gradual process of Lennox trying to tune out the extraneous noise of modern life and focus on what’s truly important to him. And it’s an evolution mirrored by the album’s sequence, which bookends the most boisterous, beat-driven songs around two stunning centerpiece tracks—\"Tropic of Cancer\" and \"Lonely Wanderer\"—that provide Grim Reaper with an extended and well-earned moment of quiet contemplation. The former is a cosmic doo-wop serenade that stands as the most affecting and beautiful vocal performance of Lennox’s career; the latter projects a gorgeous, aqueous tranquility unheard from the Animal Collective camp since side two of Feels, its light piano drizzle summoning thundercloud rumbles of foreboding reverberations.\nBut even when it trades in day-glo stompers for weightless ballads, Grim Reaper still crushes. In the unsentimental, funereal refrain of \"Tropic of Cancer\"—\"you can’t get back, you won’t come back, you can’t come back to it\"—Lennox invokes his father’s 2002 death and, in doing so, reemphasizes his own current reality as a patriarch, and that pervasive, deep-seated fear of prematurely leaving one’s family behind. If Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper posits adult life as some imaginary horror movie, it’s one where the phone call warning of impending doom is coming from inside the house. ",

        "article_text": "Starting a band is easy; an actual career in indie rock is a much tougher proposition these days. Financial success seems harder and harder to come by and saying something new within the context of guitar based music might be even more difficult. Maybe you get to express yourself, but what if you think music should aspire to something other than being a vehicle for your feelings? You’ll probably just get compared to bands who ceased to exist two decades ago. Viet Cong have clearly thought about this a lot in their brief period of existence, most of which has been spent relentlessly touring in support of last year’s introductory EP \"Cassette\". But don’t let the deadpan song titles like \"Pointless Experience\" and \"March of Progress\" throw you: the Calgary band’s self-titled debut projects unbridled passion, creativity, and possibilities while speaking in a presumably dead language of post-punk.\nTheir mission is not altogether different from that of Women, the short-lived and sorely missed indie deconstructionists in which half of Viet Cong previously served. Women existed as a band that knew its impending expiration date, operating in secrecy and driven by entropy. Their albums felt like black boxes, reports of turbulence and panic captured on grimy tape in Chad VanGaalen’s basement. They were statues during live performances, with the exception of their final show, which ended in a violent fist fight. If not necessarily a pop band on \"Cassette\", Viet Cong initially distinguished themselves with more extroverted, less intriguing impulses—there were snappy radio rock songs and Bauhaus covers amongst the typically stonefaced gestures, things that would lead you to believe that the death of guitarist Chris Reimer at 26 might have dissuaded them from trying to carry the same heft of Women.\nA year later, Viet Cong are a cohesive and confident unit that goes even further into inaccessibility than Women, confrontational in a way that reaches out to an audience rather than turning inward. The sound that begins Viet Cong most closely resembles someone trying to punch their way out of a coffin. The record ends with an 11-minute song called \"Death\". It is also a self-titled debut from a band named Viet Cong. So whether you’re familiar with their past or you’re just here because you’ve been hearing things about this band, everyone is getting the same first impression: That of a very serious rock record that won’t offer too many cuddly points of self-disclosure. So, in the moments where Viet Cong do reveal themselves, you might want to pay attention.\nTwo important instances occur during \"March of Progress\", Viet Cong’s astonishing six-minute centerpiece. Matt Flegel could be mocking the speculative nature of music criticism and predictable, tiresome process of \"proving\" one’s self in dazed, layered harmony: \"Your reputation is preceding you/ We’re all sufficiently impressed/ And this incessant march of progress/ Can guarantee our sure success.\" It proves Viet Cong are self-aware, have a subzero sense of humor to match their environs, and recognize those two qualities might combine to give the impression that this isn’t music that is meant to be enjoyed. That’s when the double-time beat kicks in, and Viet Cong make a sprightly, major-key sprint towards a dead halt. There’s mastery of form, instrumental prowess, and on a record that thrives on unpredictability, \"March of Progress\" elicits the most unexpected response—that was fun.\nViet Cong is full of knowing moments and reference points—the fact that it could pass for Guided by Voices (\"Continental Shelf\"), Wolf Parade (\"Silhouettes\"), and This Heat (take your pick) is enough of an accomplishment. It is not exactly a meta work, however. Viet Cong are just a band that’s unusually obsessed with the mechanics and process of their given trade. While their ashen sonics and rigid demeanor is liable to have them labeled as post-punk, they’re also industrial in a literal sense. Flegel’s vocals are those of a foreman, authoritative, commanding and prodding. Guitars often sound dissolved in caustic chemicals; instruments contort themselves and interlock to achieve forward momentum. It’s music that works very, very hard to express a perverse hometown pride you often see used to sell spring water or thermal outerwear —you might not want to brave Calgary’s bleak winters, but the way Viet Cong captures its forbidding chill and placid, sprawling beauty sure make it seem like a good place to be a post-punk band. \nMost of all, this is a record of exertion, where the physical investment in live performance is meant to stimulate creativity, those demoralizing tours inspiring smarter use of the studio. Viet Cong’s favorite tactic of disorientation is inversion—laying high-register, melodic bass patterns over rhythmic, disassociated six string rubble, EQ’ing percussion so it sounds like a drum machine being run through a guitar amp. And Flegel’s most passionate vocal performances deliver his most disillusioned lyrics. Viet Cong has only seven tracks and more than half don’t pass the five minute mark. Yet all are heavy, ingenious contraptions.\nThis is also a record of conflict and contrast, in particular, a winter war. The sensations of Viet Cong are specific to being bundled up in the arctic, where one’s body feels suffocating warmth and blistering cold all at once. During \"Newspaper Spoons\", shrieking guitars morph into woozy synths, the effect is like watching a bloodied hand sink into a bucket of ice. There are many times when Viet Cong reveal psych-pop as their true north—clean guitars chime, harmonies are stacked in odd, almost madrigal-like forms, and Flegel’s lyrics favor surreal imagery of liquid gold, radiated primates and telepathically \"bending newspaper spoons.\" But it’s psychedelia rendered in black and white; after three minutes of vertiginous percussion, a section of stereo-panned, autoharp-like riffs and stoned folk harmonies recall a grayscale Animal Collective ca. Feels. Meanwhile, \"Continental Shelf\" flips Echo and the Bunnymen’s \"big music\", attempting to have the sky crash down to earth rather than reaching for it.\nThese are the kind of pleasures of which Viet Cong is composed; its emotions are otherwise proprietary to Flegel. Viet Cong do not write love songs, their politics are a mystery. They have no commentary on what it means to be alive in 2015. But to hear this kind of commitment to craft, particularly rock music that maintains the vibrancy and tension of four musicians playing instruments in the same room while testing its boundaries, Viet Cong questions what it means to care about the creation of art, if not necessarily its effect on its audience. Most of Viet Cong was written during a brutal tour across what the band described as \"shit earth\" that tested their resolve and was liable to make the same old question the center of discussion—why do this, again?\nViet Cong is filled with moments that tap into the primal impulses of true post-punk—think of the first time someone puts together a couple of effects pedals and tries to make a guitar sound like something other than a guitar, of falling out with the sonic strictures of punk rock by embracing the philosophical freedom. Towards the end of \"March of Progress\", Flegel yelps, \"What is the difference between love and hate?\", and it can be taken as an allusion to the metaphysical conflict at its center; Viet Cong pits the romanticism of a newly enrolled philosophy major against the cynicism of the dropout who still hangs around the library to tell the fresh-faced youngsters it’s all bullshit. The album doesnt settle the argument, its still as volatile and spirited as it was 30 years ago. The important thing is that people are still willing to have the conversation.",

        "article_text": "Bigmouth strikes again: the latest target of Bradford Coxs verbal jabs was none other than Morrissey himself, but this particular barrage had a precision of intent that went overlooked by most online gawkers. \"Have you ever read Morrisseys description of the Ramones?,\" he asked Buzzfeed. \"I will always be on Team Joey, and Team Dee Dee. I come from America, where Bo Diddley was born!\" While Deerhunters always had a thing for indie rock advocacy, Coxs pointed patriotism was a new kind of stump speech, and in light of Monomania, his typically hilarious candor doubled as media savvy. On Deerhunter’s fifth album, they almost completely jettison the dreamy ambience that tempered even their noisiest work for straight-up raw, bleeding garage rock and populate these songs with junkyards, leather jackets, and motorcycles. The message from Deerhunter: We’re an American band.\nSo adjust your expectations accordingly, and if this sounds like the protracted playacting usually associated with Coxs work as Atlas Sound, you’re on the right track. The stable democracy of the past few Deerhunter albums has been upended; Josh Fauver left the band, and besides writing most of “Nothing Ever Happened”, his basslines kept Deerhunter rooted in proper rock. Meanwhile, after increasingly proving himself to be a top-notch songwriter in his own right, Lockett Pundt took advantage of a rare year in which Cox released no new music by dropping the excellent Spooky Action At A Distance as Lotus Plaza in 2012. His sole contribution on Monomania is “The Missing”, a fine piece of wistful, ringing indie pop that gets placed between “Leather Jacket II” and “Pensacola”, the album’s raunchiest songs. It could easily be seen as Cox defending his turf, if not for a hazy, meditative stretch during the middle of Monomania that sounds like his take on Lotus Plaza.\nBut while the songwriting power has become centralized, Monomania as a whole represents Deerhunter’s attempt to get outside themselves. This is particularly true of Cox; whereas on Cryptograms’ “Hazel St.”, he imagined what it might be like to fit in with the normal kids during his childhood in Georgia, years later, this dynamic is fully inverted and he’s found a group of outcasts that’s emboldened in their idiosyncratic embrace of a Dixie upbringing. You can hear the influence of neighbors/collaborators Black Lips in dirtbag storytelling like “Pensacola”, or just in the plain fact that Monomania is the first Deerhunter album that would be welcomed in a dive bar. Their previous physicality was defined by coiled intensity and quick strikes, whereas here they swagger and flex beer muscles. The perverted classic rawk riffs of “Neon Junkyard” and “Leather Jacket II” twist and yowl while “Back to the Middle” and “Dream Captain” are so immediately accessible, they could somehow come off as beneath Deerhunter.\nThe more prevalent inspiration comes from fellow Athenian and mentor Michael Stipe; you can hear echoes of R.E.M.’s Monster in both the obscene distortion and the decision to follow up their richest, most rococo record with a defiant squall. Cox similarly plays against his reputation given the opportunity, using winks and irony to deviate from the impression that his band’s music is somewhat humorless and sexless. It’s every bit as confrontational as Deerhunter in their dress-wearing, blog-attacking days, only more fun. This can manifest in the glammy stream-of-consciousness from Monomania’s opening duo (“I am the Queen of Bass,” he announces on “Leather Jacket II”), or any of the first-person narratives that make good on his purported Hank Williams and Bo Diddley listening. Taking as many liberties with “Werewolves of London” as Kid Rock, “Dream Captain” might come off as puerile southern comfort if it wasn’t such an obvious defilement of it-- bratty boasts like “I’m a boy, man/ And you’re a man, man” are tough to hear as anything other than comedy. Likewise, on “Pensacola”, an unfaithful woman leaves a Greyhound-riding somebody who is clearly not Bradford Cox with “a bald head and trouble.” Is it unfair that Deerhunter can get away with these because they’re Deerhunter, whereas it’s pure shlock from any number of southern rock revivalists? Perhaps, but having a laugh at ones own expense is hardly the most egregious form of an earned indulgence.\nBut while Monomania as a whole is an unpredictable fulfillment of an unforeseen whim, it’s Deerhunter’s least revelatory and surprising album on a song-by-song basis. There isn’t a clear showstopper along the lines of “Helicopter” or “Nothing Ever Happened”, though the title track makes an admirable effort. They’ve always had a knack for mantras, and after a verse of plaintive gospel shouts (“Come on God, hear my sick prayer/ If you can’t, send me an angel!”), the nagging phonetics of “mono, monomania” get repeated ad infinitum before dissolving into white noise, motorcycle revving, and a soap opera device that Deerhunter makes frequent use of: after all this time, Cox unexpectedly wakes up.\n“I was a dream of myself,” Cox admits during “Nitebike”, a startling confessional of nothing more than his reverbed vocals and acoustic guitar. Perhaps taking another step back towards the medical maladies that pervaded both his youth and early Deerhunter, he imagines himself on his Big Wheels, “On the cusp of a breakthrough/ When they took me out/ And stuck it in/ It went so deep, man.” Another line gets repeated in greater detail on the Baudelaire-referencing closer “Punk (La Vie Antérieure)”, where Cox muses, “For a year, I was queer/ I had conquered all my fears/ Not alone anymore/ But I found it such a bore.” It feels something like Cox’s “All Apologies”, a litany of wearied, bemused dissatisfaction with everything that he presumed might save him-- getting drunk, being punk, friends, lovers. The plainspoken finality of “Punk” suggests it’s not just a closure on Monomania, but of everything that preceded it.\nAnd that could be disappointing for a lot of people since Monomania is the first Deerhunter record that isn’t a quantifiable leap from what came before; the narrative and artistic arc that ran from Cryptograms to Halcyon Digest was clear and upward, their diametrically opposed centrist indie songwriting and diffuse, noisy ambience eventually converging into a brilliant horizon point. While a knocked-out, “back to basics” approach makes a lot sense as the follow-up to Halcyon Digest, it adheres to someone else’s idea of “basics” and follows the longest break between Deerhunter albums. But Monomania is certainly a strong effort on its own merits, and more importantly, they’ve avoided making their deflating “diminishing returns” record-- their King of Limbs, Centipede Hz, Transference, Sky Blue Sky, etc.-- that casts doubts about whether they’ve gone too far down the same path. They’ve pulled off something admirable in making an illogical left turn feel like the logical next step where one didn’t exist. For the first time since Cryptograms, Deerhunter’s next move will be harder to predict than Cox’s.",

        "article_text": "\"Do I shout it out?/ Do I let it go?/ Do I even know what Im waiting for?/ No, I want it now/ Do I need it, though?\" Throughout MCII, Mikal Cronin gets in these ruts. His lyrics are delivered as someone whos never fully sure of his next move and whos completely unclear about his ambitions. Hes sure that hes in love, but he keeps letting it slip away. Somehow, he keeps mucking up his day-to-day communication. It never used to be like this. He keeps talking about how time is getting away from him, which might be his way of acknowledging a crisis about getting older, though its just as likely that hes accidentally spending hours clicking on YouTube videos. He wonders if hes wrong. (He doesnt think so.) He consistently has good intentions, but hes inadvertently prone to choking on the follow-through. He sums up his turmoil pretty well in \"See It My Way\": \"I hear the song-- I wanna sing along with you/ But when I try I’m out of tune/ I turn and walk away.\" Its a sweet and snappy sentiment from someone whos ultimately out of sync. This is Cronins pop poetry for the aloof.\nSo its somewhat ironic that MCII is also his most fully realized, beautifully arranged, and well-crafted work to date. Since hes spent the past year shredding for the masses in the Ty Segall Band, its easy to forget that he recently earned his B.F.A. in Music and learned how to compose for different instruments. He rightly noted that his education came in handy for his Merge debut, which subs out some of the psych freakouts from his first album for string arrangements. K. Dylan Edrich, who recently contributed strings to Thee Oh Sees most recent two albums, lends her talents to a handful of songs, from the plaintive violin solo on \"Peace of Mind\" to the frantic viola on \"Change\". \nOne of the most impressive things about MCII is how Cronin balances \"power\" and \"pop\". He makes the \"pop\" part of the equation look effortless-- in 10 songs, he offers 10 solid, catchy melodies. When it comes to \"power,\" hes much more conservative than hes ever been before-- especially when you consider Slaughterhouse. There are entirely acoustic songs here that pretty well prove that he doesnt need to rely on punk rock sludge. So when the tender stuff is over and he steps on the fuzz pedal, the effects are extremely satisfying.\nAlbum closer \"Piano Mantra\", for example, begins with a particularly fragile-sounding Cronin singing \"I’m tired, I’m sick, I’m broke up.\" Edrichs strings are quietly introduced, then an acoustic guitar and some drums, and finally at the end, a feedback screech ushers in a distorted electric guitar. It doesnt even take center stage or threaten to become the main attraction-- it just adds a sturdy, noisy spine to Cronins formerly delicate ballad. Everything-- strings, fuzz, slide guitar, etc.-- is purposefully and carefully implemented. He uses the more muscular sounds to offset his bubblegum jangle, and while he did ask Ty Segall to lend a hand on the album, he only brought him on board for two guitar solos. Neither are very flashy-- theyre well-placed bursts of power that complement the melody.\nTheres one moment in particular that puts to rest any notion that Cronin is just a glorified garage sideman: \"Dont Let Me Go\", the only track Cronin recorded entirely by himself at home. Its just him, his acoustic guitar, and his voice singing both the melody and harmony. With that skeletal structure, he loses the \"Im not sure whats next or why I act like this\" tone and gets straight to the point. He pleads for the person he loves to give him another shot. \"Youre all I know,\" he sings in his falsetto. Its the most direct, vulnerable statement hes ever made, and in an album otherwise packed with uncertainty, its powerful.\nCronin has said that his first favorite album was Nirvanas In Utero-- a record noisily recorded with Steve Albini before the band went to R.E.M./Katrina and the Waves producer Scott Litt to soften a couple of the albums songs. Theres a loose analogy at play here-- Cronin recorded MCII with Eric \"King Riff\" Bauer at his Bay Area shred factory, Bauer Mansion. Later, he had the album mixed and mastered at Berkeleys hallowed Fantasy Studios. (Cronin has admitted that he got the idea from Segall, who worked in those same two studios for Twins.) The outcome is a great sounding album that sits nicely between the poles of \"fuzz war\" and \"cooing balladeer.\" Cronin has proved with this album that, like Cobain before him, hes so much more than a longhair with a fuzz pedal. Hes an excellent pop craftsman who knows how to turn the power up for maximum effect.",

        "article_text": "Kevin Martin, under a dozen-or-so aliases and across numerous genres, has been screwing around with deep bass for well over a decade. 1997s Tapping the Conversation-- a concept album conceived as a surrogate soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation-- was his first release as the Bug, and in retrospect, it sounds like an alternate-universe prototype of dubstep, based on instrumental hip-hop rather than UK garage rhythms. By the time he issued his 2003 follow-up Pressure, hed already charged headlong into heavy digital ragga, building a repertoire of grimy, distorted beats that mutated dancehall into a glitchy, blown-out commotion.Martins latest Bug album, London Zoo, is very much in keeping with that permutation, which stands out amidst the recent wave of dubstep in a way that makes Burials Untrue sound like Music for Airports. But it also takes the Bugs work into a somewhat cleaner, less abrasive area-- it streamlines the sound, shaves away the distortion, and draws most of its impact from the rhythms themselves. Of course, \"less abrasive\" doesnt necessarily mean it hit any less hard: Martin knows how and when to drop a heavy beat directly on top of you, and theres a carefully crafted tension throughout this record, no matter how sparse or dense that beat actually is.Sparseness and density tend to work in tandem on London Zoos strongest tracks: Bass hits at machine-gun intervals, leaving deep, tube-station echoes disintegrating in its wake and giving a number of these tracks a simultaneous sensation of freeness and claustrophobia. Reverberating, distorted voices and spare synth melodies close in on you even as they recede into the distance, and the rhythms are so pervasive and locked in that after a while you start hearing the spaces in between as much as youre hearing the beats themselves.Martin has also enlisted an army of top-notch singers and toasters for the record, ranging from dancehall veterans like Tippa Irie to Burial and Kode9 collaborator Spaceape. However, three names in particular stand out. First, theres Roll Deep member Flowdan, whose grumbling, elastic baritone contributions to the chaingun-rhythm \"Jah War\" (heard on the fantastic 2006 Planet Mu comp Mary Anne Hobbs Presents the Warrior Dubz) and last years sinster, headknock single \"Skeng\" show up again here. Flowdan is also at the center of the manic \"Warning\", which features one of the albums best hooks and a hell of a rampaging performance; theres one cool bit about halfway through where he ratchets the intensity in his voice down to a conversational rumble to match a moment in the song where the bass draws back, then resumes shouting right when it drops back in.\nSinger/toaster Ricky Ranking shows up on three tracks as well, and his vocal range-- switching from sweet melodies to foreboding chants-- is impressive, even if hes best suited to the slower numbers (especially the dirgelike closer \"Judgement\"). And the two appearances from Warrior Queen are knockouts: \"Poison Dart\", originally released as a single last year, is ruffneck feminism (\"Though me na sling no gun, a boy think sey me soft/ But me a real poison dart\") delivered with a sharp, wailing sneer over more low end than most MCs could contend with, and \"Insane\", which augments a chirpier, more buoyant flow with a smoothly-sung chorus and a few out-there adlibs, including a funny little riff on Tears for Fears \"Mad World\".The only caveat concerning London Zoo is how far it might skew away from your traditional notions of dancehall-- and even then, it helps to recognize that, if anything, this record is another manifestation of how London has transformed the sounds of Jamaica to its own ends, from 2-tone to jungle to dubstep. Its a tense record, sure, but that tension is palpable in a crossover-friendly way, invoking Babylon and fire while avoiding the more problematic aspects of \"slack\" lyrics. Its angry and ferocious, but always triumphant: When it threatens to bust out your windows and rip holes in your speakers, it crackles with the kind of force that makes you want to punch the air as hard as your subwoofers do.",

        "article_text": "On Forest Swords’ 2010 EP Dagger Paths, the web of dub, psych, dance, and drone spun by UK producer Matthew Barnes felt instantly singular. So singular, in fact, that the task of creating a worthy follow-up must have seemed daunting, which I assumed was why it took him a while. It turns out there were other reasons-- for one, he suffered from hearing problems that made his new work sound different with each listen, and forced him to consider ending Forest Swords. But also, in keeping with his music’s slow-growing vibe, he was wary of rushing things. As he admitted in a February interview, “I’m glad I took a step back…I’ve seen so many bands who strike while the iron’s hot and then burn out.”\nBarnes’ judgment proved sound, as did his ears, at least in their ability to assess his work. Created at his own pace in his own home in North West England, Engravings is the perfect sequel to Dagger Paths. Barnes steadfastly retains his sturdy loops, simple beats, and evocative guitar lines, refusing to overhaul his potent formula just to dodge accusations that he’s repeating himself. But he also gradually inserts new sounds into that equation, fitting them snugly into his songs’ accumulating layers. The result is both familiar and fresh, cementing Barnes’ knack for creating complex effects with elementary methods.\nEngravings also confirms his ability to conjure more than just a chilly, faded-memory vibe. Dagger Paths did that too, but it was easy to get lost in its burned-out echo and miss other ideas and moods that Barnes explored along the way. Here, those diverse facets of his music are unavoidable. Every song is boldly sensual, and each note has a distinct emotional hue. Mixing that intensity with dream-like atmospheres lands Engravings in a unique emotional space, one Barnes accurately describes as a “balance between really intense euphoria and this almost bleakness.”\nTrying to balance those opposites could produce disjointed, even jarring art. But one of the biggest strengths of Forest Swords’ music is its fluidity. Although Barnes adds and subtracts loops and beats without hiding the seams, he persistently maintains a DJ-like flow. As a result, following the curving path of his melodies feels more like riding a wave than cutting through choppy waters. So even a track as spliced together as “Onward”-- which opens with a stuttering clang, grafts on glittering guitar, then drifts into strings and a pounding beat-- feels completely logical, as if this is the only way time could march on.\nBarnes’ strong sense of flow lets him add new twists to his sound without forcing them in. Often they emerge sneakily, like the radio-static transmissions in “Ljoss”, the New Age piano on “Gathering”, the horn-section accents in “An Hour”, or the near-militaristic beat of ecstatic closer “Friend, You Will Never Learn”. In other places, these additions are clearer, but they’re always well-suited to their environment, as if Barnes had no other choice but to include them in his mix.\nThat’s especially true of the increased amount of singing on Engravings. The majority of it comes from Barnes’ own voice, which he sampled and then edited down to a nearly molecular level. This digital abstraction of the music’s most human element gives Engravings subliminal warmth, as if the ghosts of long-dead lyrics are watching over the songs. At times, vocals even become the focus: “Gathering” is nothing but overlapped singing for its first half, and the inclusion of Brighton-based vocalist Anneka on “Anneka’s Battle” adds vivid soul to Barnes’ brand of negative-space R\u0026B.\nBarnes inviting a guest onto a Forest Swords song is a bit surprising. His one-man music is usually a personal affair: you can practically hear him thinking through the songs as they unfold, and all the reverb and atmosphere make them feel like internal monologues. But compared to Dagger Paths, there’s more acknowledgement of the external world on Engravings. Barnes incorporates field recordings and refers to his locale in song titles; he also mixed the entire album on his laptop while sitting outside. Opening his process up a bit to include his environment perhaps explains how music this skeletal can sound like it has so much blood coursing through it.\nIt also explains how the one-man world of Forest Swords can feel so universal. Unrestricted by words or verse-chorus structures, Barnes’ songs reflect the way life can feel like an endless loop, growing and building without ever losing its cyclical nature. Maybe that’s why, even though Forest Swords’ sound skirts an array of genres, it doesn’t belong to any single one. Barnes’ work is less concerned with trends or scenes than experiences and memories that everyone has had, regardless of what music they’ve listened to before. On that count, Engravings is a broad success.",

        "article_text": "Theres hardly a bolder statement you could make about your bands penchant for innovation than writing software specifically to aid your own distinctive compositional style. This is what Brent Knopf did; his program is called Deeler, and it allows his band, Menomena, to improvise short ideas and use them as the building blocks for broad, loop-based compositions which they then learn to play live. The method borrows most obviously from hip-hop and glitch, and you can pick up slight traces of both in the bands sound, but this music is distinctly pop-oriented, and reasonably traditional where its core melodies are concerned.\nThe album opens with an accelerated, processed drum roll and then busts out into the aggressive rhythmic assault of \"Cough Coughing\". Drummer Danny Seim and bassist/guitarist Justin Harris can cut it up like nobodys business, and for some large portions of the song, its just them sparsely making a groove happen, with vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Knopfs quivering piano occasionally rising like the ghost of an old ambient house record. The songs midsection is a series of head-spinning leaps and cuts through myriad textures, with Knopf resting on a tense piano melody.\nBut its not all highwire-act dynamics and ADD jams: I Am the Fun Blame Monster also brims with mood, a dark energy and sense of direction permeating every song. \"The Late Great Libido\" is a perfect testament to this, with its rivers of bubbling piano, droning sax and frenetic drums. The track is a not-too-distant cousin of Blur, but it does things in ways most bands would never dream of, bursting in the middle with thundering guitar melodies, building itself up in increments, snapping to silence and back, and sending each verse up differently than the one before. Harmonies float in on beautiful beds of piano in one instant, chase away tinkling glockenspiels the next, and then retreat altogether, yielding the field to pianos and heavily delayed drums. Elements you thought had disappeared for good resurface in new contexts with new meanings. Youll never get it all on the first listen, but therell be no shaking that melody; Menomena could have a huge hit on their hands-- at least at the college level-- if this track finds its way into the right mitts.\nSurprises like the ones in \"The Late Great Libido\" are packed tightly into every song: guitars crash in only to anticipate silence, pianos weave through minefields of modular percussion, and Knopfs pleasing tenor runs a gauntlet of processing and fading to deliver what are fundamentally very basic melodies. \"E. Is Stable\" springs from a simple guitar line, repeatedly building up and breaking down, while \"Strongest Man in the World\" feels light until Knopfs hand reaches to the bottom octave of the piano and anchors the song to a sinister bass figure.\nEssentially, the bands process of building from small blocks enables them to put endless variations on each basic section of their songs-- introducing a pulsing organ and a plaintive piano separately, for instance, and then heaving them together in multiple combinations later in the song. Even the vocals are, by and large, just another module to be played with, disappearing for minutes at a time and reemerging with choruses just as you begin to grow accustomed to their absence.\nSuffice to say, Menomena are a hugely creative band, and with I Am the Fun Blame Monster, theyve managed to make an album thats extremely accessible yet entirely unconventional. The thing that drew me to the album in the first place was the crazy artwork, which features a flipbook of four photos and very little other information, save that the discs title is an anagram for \"the first Menomena album.\" Its just one more subtlety that exemplifies the depth of detail apparent on this record.",

But instead of marveling under the iron ribs of St. Pancras or hunting Cornish abbeys-- as did Betjemen, who vented through art and eventually found solace in Britains spiritual architecture-- Clearlake construct their own echoing places of worship in Cedars, with some help from the Cocteau Twins Simon Raymonde.\nWith the bands arcane 2001 debut, Lido, behind him, lyricist Jason Pegg clouds his nostalgia with fear and devilry. As drums clap like pew-kneelers under buttresses of strings on \"The Mind Is Evil\", Pegg warns like a grimacing choirboy, \"it makes me do all those unspeakable things.\" This veiling of coal-colored sentiment in majestic settings runs through every track. In \"Keep Smiling\", the lines \"Just nod your head accordingly and do the opposite of anything they tell you\" mirror Thom Yorkes Hail to the Thief manifesto, but Peggs de-politicized subversion strikes harder-- as unlike Yorkes reaction against the obvious, with his willingness to point the finger inward to less-admittable wickedness. Elsewhere, processional whipcracks of percussion and paint-chipped baby grands drive him to admit \"I wouldnt hurt a fly, but Id really like to punish you\" on \"Id Like to Hurt You\", suggesting that any of us can snap under pressure-- whether that pressure results from government, the anxious Zeitgeist, or ex-girlfriends, Pegg doesnt say, but the universal ambiguity of his sentiments injects the music with a raw and timeless nature.\nThe inherently uplifting alto in Peggs lucid, lachrymose throat reverberates touches of Tin Pan Alley, layering Clearlakes sound beyond the typical moping of todays frontmen. One can almost picture him singing these songs to a starlet as he ambles across an opera-house stage. Chopped-up streaks of a flanged keyboard even whip through \"Almost the Same\" like stagehands hustling backdrops in Rodgers and Harts Autobahn: The Musical.\nThroughout Cedars, Clearlake continually find beauty in melancholy and melancholy behind beauty, while raising your hairs in reverence with occasional guitar squalls. Murals of feedback, keyboards, and chanting close in around \"Come into the Darkness\". As Pegg inverts the Golden Rule into a mantra of selfish motivation on \"Treat Yourself with Kindness\", lurching chords burst up the walls like shadows springing in sudden bold bars of light through stained glass. The drama segues into the closing hymn of \"Trees in the City\", where hope is found in the resilient growth of greenery in a smoky metropolis.\nBetjeman too bemoaned the \"Motopolis\" that choked the charm from Oxford and the suburban sprawl of Slough with the blackest of humor. The British love to honor through a lacerating wit. It seems almost as if modernity is tolerated only with the thought that one day humanity will lose and the English countryside will expel the scars of society. Sauron will fall. Clearlake fit into this tradition as true patriots. While Lido may have been a last bastion of Britpop, Cedars towers in the tradition of the best British art.",

        "article_text": "Internet platforms arent genres, and maybe its time to call a moratorium on treating them like they are. In 2006, when Charlotte Aitchison turned 14, she started recording a later-shelved album she has more recently disowned as \"fucking terrible MySpace music.\" Now, almost seven years later, her proper debut album as Charli XCX can hardly avoid comparisons to Tumblr, from fans and detractors alike. \nA simple misreading of the UK singer and songwriters biggest hit might explain this focus on technology-based shorthand. Swedish electro-pop duo Icona Pops 2012 global smash \"I Love It\", co-written by Charli XCX but not on True Romance, emphasizes a generational divide: \"Youre from the 70s/ And Im a 90s bitch.\" Sure, Aitchison was born in 1992, but her use of social-media formats also long frequented by droves of people born in the 1970s isnt exactly remarkable in 2013. As that catchy kiss-offs Republica-on-EDM wattage illuminates, Charli XCX is a would-be 90s pop star, too. And in only the best sense.\nTrue Romance shares its title with an unbelievably well-cast 1993 movie written by Quentin Tarantino, who was reassembling cultural detritus way before mash-ups and microblogging. Charli XCXs approach to pop is similarly postmodern (how 90s does that sound?), pulling from moody 80s synth-pop, sassy turn-of-the-millennium girl groups, and state-of-the-art contemporary producers to create something distinctive and immediately memorable. She clearly understands the internet, having shared two original mixtapes and two influences mixtapes before her official full-length, but this carefully pruned set is no data dump. And there youll see a glimmer of True Romances most throwback aspect: its evident pop ambition, an overriding sense of an imagined mass audience for music thats radio-ready yet outsider-friendly. Its almost like Napster-- and the filler-crammed album sales model that preceded it-- never happened.\nIn fact, by the time Charli XCX was a teenage electro-house devotee, illegal file-sharings early free-for-all had already given way to iTunes and other legal download services. Robyn had already released her self-titled comeback album. So it might be only natural that Charli XCX would keep the pre-bubble faith that people will pay for emotionally direct, bubblegum-catchy, yet stubbornly left-of-center songs about falling in and out of love. But the generous hooks on the previously released singles here, such as the gospel-kissed prechorus of the yearning \"Stay Away\" or the Santigold-savvy lilt of love-and-the-bomb brooder \"Nuclear Seasons\", are extraordinarily welcome just the same. Even better are newer singles such as the gorgeously bitter \"You (Ha Ha Ha)\", which inhabits its cloud-rappy Gold Panda sample like they were made for each other, and the almost-as-gorgeously blissful \"What I Like\", which recounts a still-young relationship with the cheeky frankness of Lily Allen or the Streets, and the sing-songy near-rapping of the Spice Girls.\nThe several songs on True Romance that hadnt previously surfaced in videos or other releases arent quite as strong, but theyre effective enough to suggest Charli XCXs best work might still be ahead of her. The Todd Rundgren-sampling \"So Far Away\", with the sun-dappled lushness of the Avalanches, is a clear highlight; Charli XCXs vocals are usually plain-spoken, but the anguished break-up plea \"Set Me Free\" proves she can reach for Jessie Ware-like dramatics when appropriate. The pitch-shifting \"no one is forever\" intro added at the start of opener \"Nuclear Seasons\" probably shouldve been given its own track-- and later on the album it is, when the same backing vocal forms the base of the cloudy, broken-hearted \"Grins\". Elsewhere, the haunted confession \"How Can I\", while solid enough, is a reminder that Charli XCXs lyrics so far tend to fall relatively flat; when, on swooning finale \"Lock You Up\", she sings, \"It hits me like a ton of bricks,\" she leaves the cliché untweaked.\nAnd then theres \"Cloud Aura\", a lovelorn, engagingly laid-back bit of groove that lets Grimes \"Genesis\" video co-star Brooke Candy rap horribly about Chris Brown. Candys guest verse previously appeared on 2012s uneven Super Ultra mixtape, and it was near-universally panned. It isnt any better now. But in an era when too many up-and-comers are all too eager to please, this stubborn refusal to back down displays another quality in short supply: genuine irreverence. The songwriting and production credits on True Romance include Ushers \"Climax\" co-conspirator Ariel Rechtshaid and \"I Love It\" collaborator Patrick Berger, among others, who also share some credit (and blame). But like 90s pop stars turned 10s pop sophisticates Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé, Charli XCX stamps her personality across the entire project, and True Romance suggests shell be worth following for a while. On Tumblr, Instagram, and whatever comes next, sure, but musically most of all.",

        "article_text": "By now you probably dont need to be told the particulars of Sleater-Kinneys new album, The Woods: about how they signed with Sub Pop, making it their first album since 1995s Call the Doctor not released by Kill Rock Stars; about how they hired Dave Fridmann to produce and recorded it in rural New York instead of Washington State; about how they wanted a heavier sound that mines classic rock like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix for inspiration; about how one song is more than 11 minutes in length.\nSo it should come as no surprise that The Woods marks a significant transformation for the band-- one they first hinted at on 2000s All Hands on the Bad One, and crept closer toward on 2002s One Beat. Nor should anyone be shocked that, despite the new song structures, guitar solos, and drum fills, Brownsteins guitar still roars wildly, Weisss drums still thunder, and Tucker still wails with a primal urgency that is one of the most compelling sounds in rock music today. What hasnt necessarily been made explicitly clear is that, even in the face of its cock-rock trappings, The Woods most closely recalls the righteous fury of their first great albums, Call the Doctor (1995) and Dig Me Out (1996).\nThe brash economy of punk, for Sleater-Kinney at least, has always been just a short step away from the lumbering behemoth of hard rock. \"The Fox\", however, seems to say otherwise. Opening the album, this piece of Aesop rock is about a fox and a duck, and I think it just might be allegorical. But its loud and it thrashes and Tucker shouts to be heard over the din. Its ferociously uninviting, but it works both as a context-providing preface to the nine songs that follow and as a deterrent for weak-eared listeners. Those who make it to \"Wilderness\" will have passed a test of sorts.\n\"Wilderness\" and most of \"Whats Mine Is Yours\" sound like prime Sleater-Kinney, as does much of the rest of The Woods. Fridmanns presence is far from disruptive; you can hardly hear him in the mix, except for a little sludge in the low end-- a nice substitution for a bass player. Instead of weighing them down with single-micd Flaming Lips drums or Delgados density, he simply steps out of the way and allows them to sound larger, louder, and looser.\nTurning their crosshairs away from the overt political issues of One Beat, Sleater-Kinneys amplification here sounds like a reaction to the current wave of backwards-looking boys-club bands that idolize post-punk dramatists like Joy Division and the Cure and abstractors like Gang of Four and Wire. (And anyway, werent the women of Elastica working this same nostalgia, like, 10 years ago?) On \"Entertain\"-- the first single, no less-- Brownstein chides the eyeliner brigade righteously: \"You come around looking 1984/ Youre such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, youre using it like a whore/ Its better than before.\"\nBut Sleater-Kinney are looking backwards too, albeit to a different time in rock history and to different styles, as well as with a greater open-mindedness and self-awareness. Many of the hard-rock trappings of The Woods sound self-conscious: Leading into the album-closing \"Night Light\", the 11-minute guitar solo on \"Lets Call It Love\" is just that-- an 11-Minute Guitar Solo. The badass breakdown on \"Whats Mine Is Yours\" is just that-- a Badass Breakdown. But the point of \"Lets Call It Love\" is the equation of music and sex as Brownstein sings, \"Ive got a long time for love\" and then proves it with her guitar. And the point of \"Whats Mine Is Yours\" is, as the lyrics reveal, not the breakdown but the recovery: As Brownsteins guitar squawks boisterously and arrhythmically, Tucker stitches it together with a low Led Zep riff and Weiss wraps it up with a big drum beat, all three of them literally creating music from chaos.\nIn other words, this hard-rock transformation sounds like an extension of all the meta songs theyve been writing since before \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\"-- rock-about-rock songs that chronicle their experience as an all-woman band and that deploy that self-reflexivity as a weapon against industry double standards and general ignorance. In the past, this self-awareness often resulted in songs that sounded closed-off, each with its own extremely precise meaning that related but didnt always connect to other songs around it. The Woods, on the other hand, is their most album-like album since The Hot Rock, each song building on the previous and leading to the next. With its artificially sweetened melody, \"Modern Girl\", for instance, almost sounds saccharine (\"My whole life is like a picture of a sunny day\"), but coming after \"Jumpers\", a song so empathetic it considers suicide a viable act of defiance, \"Modern Girl\" takes on deeper meanings. The pair are two sides of the same woman, the ultimate predicament: To survive these days, you have to be either suicidal or superficial. Sleater-Kinney, meanwhile, get by simply sounding fucking supersonic.\n ",

        "article_text": "When Odd Future first tumbled out of Southern Los Angeles County in 2010, it wasn’t the high-strung antics of the group’s de facto figurehead Tyler, the Creator that tipped them into the spotlight. It was Earl Sweatshirt, unbelievably young (15? 16?) and skilled beyond his years, a methodical wordsmith whose splatterpunk murder fantasies were rendered all the more unsettling by his incredible poise. The video for “Earl” (off the mixtape of the same name), wherein Sweatshirt and company down a risky drug cocktail and party until they begin to decay, was integral in setting the then-unknown collective on its crash course with hip-hop notoriety. But just as Odd Future took off, Earl appeared to vanish. Once a menacing presence over Tyler’s post-Neptunes synth wheeze, Earl was frustratingly absent from the group’s inaugural round of live shows and festival spots as well as the second round of Odd Future solo efforts. The group refused to provide an explanation for the lingering absence of its best rapper when pressed, opting instead to lead fans through a quixotic “Free Earl” campaign immortalized in t-shirts, records, and elaborate satirical fan fiction.\nAfter a winding investigation, Complex was eventually able to trace Earl to a Samoan retreat for at-risk teen boys. It seems his mother, a civil rights activist and law professor, had shipped him overseas to clear his head after behavioral problems bled into his schoolwork. Barring an expository chat with The New Yorker, Earl fell silent after the reveal until turning up unexpectedly on Twitter one night in early 2012 with a new song called “Home” that closed with Sweatshirt giddily announcing his return: “I’m baaaack. Bye.” He appeared on various ephemera afterward: a supremely anesthetized spot on “Super Rich Kids” off Frank Ocean’s Grammy Award winning Channel Orange, an unannounced freestyle on the posse cut “Oldie” from The OF Tape Vol. 2 compilation, and tracks with OF compatriot Domo Genesis and Flying Lotus’ rap alter ego Captain Murphy. He seemed to pick right up where the maleficent EARL left off, the new verses touting the same deadpanned orgies of bloodletting and misanthropy.\nIt wasn’t until the end of 2012 release of the single “Chum” that Earl addressed his story in song. Built around a simple, affecting piano figure and clattering boom bap low end, “Chum” was a travelogue of a lost soul seemingly back on track. In it Earl opens up about a life of struggles, from the absence of his father, one-time South African Poet Laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile, after a split from his mother (“I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest/ When honestly I miss this nigga like when I was six”), to discovering drugs and petty crime, finding a big brother in Tyler, and the fallout from the Complex expose. “Chum” was the most personal and direct he’d ever been on record; it was gobstopping without relying on the trick of sullying the youthful zest of his voice with grim stories of death and defilement.\nLoosed from the nauseating gutbucket grit of EARL, Sweatshirt uses his Columbia Records debut Doris to convey a more varied palette of emotions. He challenges the uplifting mood of “Burgundy”’s jazzy Neptunes production, addressing the illness of his grandmother, insecurities about the new material, and lingering issues with his father in one fell swoop (“My priorities fucked up, I know it, I’m afraid I’m going to blow it/ When them expectations raising cause daddy was a poet”). He’s a distant lover on “Sunday”, trading verses with Frank Ocean about trying to tend to withering relationships as studio rats and touring musicians. “Hive” captures the sobering realities of L.A.’s inner city as Earl, his voice just above a whisper, speaks of hopeless commuters biking to jobs that don’t pay their bills (“From a city that’s recession hit/ Where stressed niggas could flex metal with pedals to rake pennies in”). The resignation in his voice in these moments of reflection is every bit as communicative as his unflappable stream of internal rhymes and arresting visual images.  \nEven in the face of the newfound depth in Earl’s songwriting, Doris’ primary concern is his wordplay, which presents itself in thickets of rhymes so dense they can register as inscrutable on first listen. “Hive”’s second verse opens with: “Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish/ But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stays preg-a-nant,” a glob of offbeat references, double entendres, made up words, and brilliantly disguised slant rhymes that hit as great exercises in rhyming words well before the deeper meanings can be teased out. Doris is also relatively hookless; where heaping doses of melody helped Tyler, the Creator break form earlier this year with Wolf, here it’s just raps on raps on raps. Guests are frequent, but they either come out rhyming for dear life, as Odd Future affiliate Vince Staples does when he swipes “Hive” out from under Earl in the third verse. Or they play hype man like Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA on “Molasses” and Vince in the spirited pep talks between Earl’s verses on “Burgundy”. The focus never strays from Earl’s fractious, DOOM-influenced songwriting for long, and Doris prefers to dispense it in short, impactful bursts as the “half short and twice strong” EARL did in 2010.\nThe album breezes by in 44 minutes, but it feels longer. Earl favors droning, lumbering productions full of intriguing sound textures, but he pulls in enough curveballs to give the album a jerky energy. In the first few minutes alone, we get the airy keys and trap drums of opener “Pre”, brash horns and live drums on “Burgundy”, and piddling video game synths battling chunky bass on “20 Wave Caps”. Between the campy drum shuffle newly added to the end of the otherwise austere “Chum” and the shrill violin trills that usher in a shock beat change in the middle of “Centurion”, Doris gets as much of its jollies from settling into dark, forbidding soundscapes as it does from unexpectedly ripping us up out of them. Without the noirish serial killer stories of earlier work to fall back on, Earl has discovered new ways to shock and disorient the listener.\nDoris is full on its author’s prodigious abilities as a formidable young voice in L.A.’s resurgent hip-hop scene, but it’s not as concerned with the wider significance of the moment as it is with disbelief it’s actually happening. As comebacks go, it’s shockingly insular and unassuming. Earl remains self-deprecating throughout; he produces a number of the album’s tracks under the telling moniker Randomblackdude. Even when he skirts the mainstream, he does so with cautious optimism. Earl made a television appearance with the Roots on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" this month, running through the boisterous “Burgundy” with eyes closed after a tense walk from the blue room to the stage. It was a peculiar event, the anticlimactic unveiling of a star who’d been the talk of rap circles for three years but scarcely able to relish the attention. With Doris, Odd Future’s Odysseus is finally back and chasing the ghosts out of his head.",

        "article_text": "Santa Claus, the Virgin Mary, and Terrence \"Turkeytime\" Terrence just got the shaft this holiday season. Why bother with presents? 2005s Tickle Me Elmo was supposed to be a chicken-legged Sri Lankan with so much sex in her self-spun neons you might as well get wasted off penicillin with Willie Nelson at a secret Rex the Dog show. But guess what? On Halloween she showed up in Philadelphia for her Fader gig, sat herself under a big fucking Christmas tree, and dished out free copies of Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1, the mixtape masterpiece she and Diplo Hollertronix had spent the 10 previous days putting together in his apartment. Batteries included!\nSo a large portion of her forthcoming debut, Arular, has willfully gone leaky boat here. Many of her tracks sound similar to one another: A 505 Groovebox queefs out splatty, farty beats and M.I.A. shouts lyrics of varying snark over them, sometimes even singing them. (Sometimes.) Shes been irresistible in single land, but M.I.A.s full-length runs the risk of seeming limited and discrediting her misleading but awesome \"female Dizzee Rascal\" tag, replacing that description with \"Neneh Cherry, Mk. II\"-- a label that has likely dawned on anyone who has seen the \"Buffalo Stance\"-like \"Galang\" video.\nThat is why this mixtape kills: The format fits M.I.A. perfectly. Her songs benefit greatly from Diplos recent baile funk fetish (confer his recent Favela On Blast tape), some choice dub and American hip-hop cuts to break up the blaze to blaze and razorblades, and some flat-out brilliant mashups.\nOn the upstroke, \"Galang\" goes reggaeton; on the down, Diplo cops the song a Lil Vicious beat and a lil keyboard hook, and its so whoa youll have to punch yourself in the face to stop smiling. \"Fire Fire\" goes bam bam then walks like an Egyptian in a telling Bangles mashup-- the two songs play so nicely together they could be siamese, until Diplo misdemeans \"Pass That Dutch\" with M.I.A.s snakey music box schwarma. M.I.A.s \"Amazon\" coupled with Ciaras radio-friendly microcrunk squelch is an early highlight, though that squirmy synth on Clipses \"Definition of a Roller\" makes for good freak, too, packing just enough snaggletooth funk to forgive those recent Neptunes missteps.\nFor a tape whose initial appeal was the instant and gratifying relief it brought to everyone waiting for M.I.A.s full-length, Diplo ironically saves M.I.A.s best cuts for last. \"URAQT\" is a jittery mess of flirting, territory-marking, and text-messaging (!): \"You fuckin with my man and you text him all the time/ You mighta had him once but I have him all the time,\" and later, \"U-R-A-Q-T/ Is your daddy dealer, cause youre dope to me!\" For dessert, Diplo brings \"Big Pimpin\" out of retirement to back M.I.A.s raspy \"Bingo\": \"Do you know what is on? Do you know what is on? Do you know how this beat is made in fucking Lon-d-d-don?\" The songs obviously great, but between M.I.A.s fierce deliveries and the braggart beat, it sounds weird and ominous, a black-hole closer to an album brimming with life.\nLast week, Sasha Frere-Jones profiled M.I.A. in The New Yorker, spraypainting her as a consummate and naturally \"world\" artist. M.I.A. is silly, dancey, cheap, expensive, truthful, and utterly serious all at once-- just like the world (!). Shes not exactly rags-to-riches (yet), but her pop carries unwittingly significant weight, and to potentially far more people than just a few hundred ecstatic MP3 blog readers. Its one thing for M.I.A. to be a \"world\" pop star; it will be another thing for her to release an album that reflects that backstory. For now, Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1 takes that burden off of Arular: Diplo has actualized our hopes for M.I.A. qua world pop star, and we didnt even have to leave him cookies.",

        "article_text": "The very last scene in the 2006 documentary American Hardcore finds Zander Schloss of the Circle Jerks delivering a eulogy. \"It was over a long time ago! Its over, okay? Go home! Your cage is clean.\" The screen goes black just as Black Flags \"Nervous Breakdown\" starts up; the vocal is by Keith Morris, Black Flag co-founder and Schloss longtime boss in the Circle Jerks. Its a funny juxtaposition, considering the recent history of the Circle Jerks; though Morris attempted to keep the Jerks engine running after yet another failed go, he and Burning Brides frontman Dimitri Coats teamed up, called a couple of buddies, ground out 16 songs. The results would stop in their tracks anybody whod dare declare punk rock dead. Morris was around for the birth of hardcore, and from the sound of his new band OFF!, theyre going to have to drag him away from the stuff, screaming.\nFor OFF!, Morris and Coats rang up bassist Steven McDonald of the perennially underrated Redd Kross, and Rocket From the Crypt/Earthless drummer Mario \"Ruby Mars\" Rubalcaba. Coats may be OFF!s least known quantity, but here, as with the stoner rock of his Brides, hes got an adaptable style and ear for detail that are perfect for this recapturing job. McDonald holds down the low end with an uncharacteristic simplicity that suits these airtight tracks to a T. And Ruby Mars couldnt have been a tough call, hell of a drummer that he is; youd have to be to hold these songs together. These guys might be punks, but after years in the game, theyre total pros. And all that backstory melts away in three seconds on this bruiser of a record, one that reignites the hardcore spirit and turn-on-a-dime intensity of Morris work with Black Flag and early Circle Jerks years without ever coming off like a history lesson.\nOFF! is Morris show, and for all their help getting him back to his roots, the band keeps out of his way, firing off blistering, not-a-second-too-long rumbles that feel shot out of a cannon. But having some new blood in the room lights a raging fire under Morris, and he pounces on these tracks. As ever, he speak-shouts with an unusual clarity, even when hes spraying out a ton of words at once. But its the adaptability of his voice thats most stunning, the way hell start out spitting and then swoop down into a scream. Lyrically, the OFF! songs seem to play on Morris role as an angry young man all grown up; a line like \"you wonder why Im always screaming?\" would sound fine coming from some 17-year-old with a glue-stuck mohawk, but given Morris elder statespunk position, the question deepens, the emphasis falls on the \"always.\" The young dude declaring \"Ive Had It\" three decades back still shouts \"Fuck People\" with equal fervor.\nFirst Four EPs crams 16 tracks into just over 17 minutes; the things packed so tightly, an extra second here or there could feel like one too many. This is lean, propulsive hardcore, played just as it wouldve been in L.A. circa 1981. The live-in-a-room recording lets you all but hear the sweat drip on the mic, Morris hair slapping into Coats amp. The breathless intensity of Morris vocals is matched by the one-and-done feel of the musicianship; as Coats told Pitchfork last month, \"the demo is the record,\" and no decisions been overthought. Morris spent a decade and a half trying to get the Circle Jerks together enough to make another album, and this thing sounds like it was made in two days, almost for the hell of it, and those lowered stakes result in a ramped-up fervor.\nEven with the short runtime, First Four EPs really takes it out of you; each EP takes you through highs and lows in quick succession, so hearing all four straight through is like being put through a tenderizer. For all their ripchord intensity, I wish theyd made just a little more room for McDonald, whose work with Redd Kross proved him more adept at sneaking intricate bass lines under hardcore rhythms than hes allowed here. But these are, after all, the first four EPs, which assumes theres more to come. You could argue that theres a nasty conservative streak running through these four EPs, that Morris already made better versions of this record with his previous bands. But OFF! feels less like a regression than a regrouping, a shoring up of old strengths with the hopes of recapturing an old feeling. And that much they nail.\nIn an indie rock landscape that typically values complex arrangements, subtlety, and good taste, OFF! are not just refreshing, but totally necessary. Its an economic shithole out there right now-- the same conditions that led to hardcore in the first place. This music is built for a climate of frustration and powerlessness, and its bare-knuckled punch-in-the-face is a long-needed wake-up call to nostalgic escapism. Get mad instead.",

        "article_text": "Jens Lekman does not have a girlfriend. This seems to be an injustice on par with the Sony rootkit fiasco and the cancellation of \"Arrested Development\". Lekman is charming. He writes orchestral pop songs that swoon like silent movie damsels in distress. He rhymes \"chili\" with \"chilly.\" The Swedish singer/songwriter hasnt been in a relationship for four years. Blaming the music business for his non-existent love life, he recently threatened to quit releasing records to become a telemarketer.\nSomebody hook this guy up with Nerve Personals quick-- we need to keep him around. Oh Youre So Silent Jens, his new collection of previously released singles and B-sides, is a marvel of pure songcraft. Clichés unravel, traditional structures break down and build back up again, unpretentious witticisms sparkle. And then there are the sonics of the thing: lo-fi Phil Spector room dividers of sound, unexpected samples, and Lekmans rich, cavernous monotone.\nLekman is often compared to Stephin Merritt (deadpan delivery, debt to Tin Pan Alley), Morrissey (melodrama, dry humor), Jonathan Richman (naiveté, simple language), and Belle and Sebastian (flowery arrangements, twee sensibility). All of these comparisons are dead on, and Lekman is worthy of the kind of slobbering devotion slathered on these artists. Granted, his 2004 debut album, When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog, was a tentative first step, relying too heavily on unadulterated cheese-- but Oh Youre So Silent Jens is cheese, chocolate, strawberries, and something tangy to wash it down with.\nTake \"Maple Leaves\", two versions of which bookend the disc. An exploration of the difficulties of communication between men and women, it glides on pillowy strings, tearjerker harp flourishes, stately tympani, girl-group backing oohs, and celebratory wedding bells. He gets away with groan-worthy lines like, \"If you dont take my hand/ Ill lose my mind completely/ Madness will finally defeat me,\" not just on the strength of a strong melody and keen production sense, but by following it with one of the albums great signature lyrical twists: \"She said it was all make believe/ But I thought she said maple leaves.\" Lekman winks through his tears. \"And when she talked about a fall/ I thought she talked about Mark E. Smith.\"\nA diligent student of American and UK indie pop, Lekman knows exactly where he fits in the world-historical timeline, and he splatters his influences all over his songs. \"Maple Leaves\" borrows from the lush source material for the Avalanches \"Since I Left You\". The fantastic \"Black Cab\" wallows luxuriously in loneliness (\"You dont know anything/ So dont ask me any questions/ Just turn the music up/ And keep your mouth shut\") and samples both Belle and Sebastian and the Left Banke. On \"F-word\", Lekman ties a piece of Arab Straps \"Kate Moss\" to stray cats pleading outside his Gothenburg window. \"Pocketful of Money\" is a spare symphony of finger snaps, pithy piano and bass melodies, and Lekmans pledge to spend a months salary on a girl he just met who turns his legs to spaghetti-- but then Calvin Johnsons deeply intoned \"Ill come running with a heart on fire,\" snagged from Beat Happenings \"Gravedigger Blues\", crashes in unexpectedly. This off-key intrusion has the potential to be a deal-breaker, but Lekman instead turns it into a lovely counterpoint to his own soaring echo of the phrase.\nLike all love affairs, Oh Youre So Silent Jens isnt perfect. The tracks from last years Rocky Dennis concept EP are a mushy mess, and the plodding, doleful solo piano ballad \"Sky Phenomenon\" is only saved by two brilliant lines: \"At this time of year/ Its like someone spilled a beer/ All over the atmosphere,\" and, \"But I would not be accepted/ Cause I cant dance the funky chicken.\" Lekmans faithful cover of Television Personalities \"Someone to Share My Life With\" (\"that someone could be you\") is the kind of thing that makes women roll their eyes and hop onto the back of a motorcycle driven by Tommy Lee.\nWhich brings us back to the true source of Lekmans girl problems. It isnt the industrys fault that he cant find true love-- if anything, the kind of exposure his music has brought should be more effective than the best personal ad. But then, maybe his lack of a girlfriend isnt such a tragedy. As much as us ladies might fantasize about being saviors to wounded butterflies like Lekman, the reality of actually sharing a life with a guy whose desperation is so public is fairly unappealing. Who really wants a song like \"Julie\" (appearing here in jubilant, hollow-drummed remix form) written about her, even if it contains the couplet, \"Oh Julie, meet me by the vending machine/ Oh Julie, Im gonna buy you a wedding ring\"? And does Lekman truly desire a nice, boring, healthy relationship? If he found The One and lived happily ever after, he wouldnt have anything to write about.\n ",

        "article_text": "If you’re unsure of why Lykke Li named her third album I Never Learn, the last four songs leave nothing to the imagination: “Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone”, “Never Gonna Love Again”, “Heart of Steel”, “Sleeping Alone”. The titles alone feel like disclaimers—are you willing to live life on these terms? Its worth noting, then, that Lykke Li moved over 5,400 miles from her native Sweden to Los Angeles at the age of 28 after the most painful breakup of her life. It hardly matters that almost none of us will experience anything like that; what is important is that many of us have endured the kind of heartbreak that made it feel like your old self is halfway across the planet. But if you’ve ever just secretly hoped your life could inspire such romantic ideals of romantic failure, wish fulfillment doesn’t come more potent than I Never Learn.\nI Never Learn is both spartan and expansive; its Li’s most ambitious and shortest album, at nine songs and 33 minutes. This is widescreen drama meant to hit with direct and precise impact, so the operative term for advance singles “No Rest For the Wicked” and “Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone” has been “Spector-esque.” Its a fair comparison, as Li plays a winner-take-all game of “He loves me, he loves me not” accompanied by a host of string players and drums that beat and thump like a flawed human heart. Li relies on classic emotive archetypes as well—excepting “I Will Always Love You”, torch songs don’t get much more literal than “Never Gonna Love Again”, and as with most of I Never Learn, its incapacitating sense of impending emptiness is closer in spirit to “I Have Nothing”.\nThe power ballads are just what the tag implies: ballads that require an enormous amount of exertion and are about power itself, whether it’s helplessly putting in the hands of another (“Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone”), taking ownership of your culpability (“No Rest For the Wicked”), or watching it disappear in a moment of passion (“Gunshot”). Rather than evoking a specific decade of music, though, Li approaches this style of songwriting as musical theater that should be created by something other than a proper band—either by professionals just off-screen, or some kind of studio magic.\nI Never Learn utilizes the simplest tools of confessional songwriting: uneasily strummed acoustic guitars and resonant piano chords enlarged for texture and dramatic flair, like they’re appearing from behind a just-raised curtain, or from a radio as you sing to yourself. Thanks to the cavernous production, the enduring mental image of I Never Learn isn’t Li slumping over a glass of whiskey, but rather letting fresh wounds breathe, soundchecking alone in an empty arena.\nNote the word “arena”, because even if these are stark, personal songs, there’s a tacit acknowledgment here of Lis status as a pop star on the verge. She drops a lot of the ingratiating and occasionally grating mannerisms of Youth Novels and Wounded Rhymes that could be viewed as defense mechanisms—coyly sung melodies, the coquettish humor, and the booming beats and handclaps that endeared her to many but could also did little to dispel the idea of her as a benefactor of “Young Folks”’ cottage industry of meet-cute indie-pop. The onyx-and-gray, dead serious, striking cover shot of I Never Learn isn’t fronting on you; Li hangs around David Lynch, collaborates with A$AP Rocky and admires Beyoncé, Drake, and Rihanna, all of whom commingle celebrity and artistry to serve as avatars, people through whom we can imagine how our idealized selves might sing, dress, fuck, or hurt.\nLi is not a tabloid fixture nor a force of nature, and I Never Learn takes advantage of that by emphasizing the rawness of her lower registers and utilizing negative space to keep things from getting too far out of proportion. At times, the record resembles a pocket version of Adele’s eternal 21. Yes, “Love Me Not I’m Not Made of Stone” does American teenagers a disservice by showing up a couple weeks late for prom season, but right when Li chokes on the line, “Even though it….hurts,” she negates any idea of this being makeout music; it’s more like getting told \"lets be friends\" in the middle of a slow dance.  \nThe artillery-riddled, burnished metal of “Gunshot” was helmed by Greg Kurstin, best known as a collaborator of P!nk, Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry—but he’s also the guy who produced Tegan \u0026 Sara’s Heartthrob, another record that commingled teenaged emotions with adult situations and vice versa while nudging a beloved, modest act in a way that led to a polished, radio-ready album that reflected their real-life popularity.\n“Gunshot” is I Never Learn’s fist-pumping climax and a total outlier, as longtime producer Björn Yttling still handles the majority of I Never Learn, his trademark, treble-harshed reverb making each lovelorn lullaby sound like it’s smeared with Lis own tears and ruined makeup. That lends a crucial, tactile reality in Lis sadness, since very few of her lyrics are going to remind people of things their significant others have actually said to them—“Every time the rain falls, think of me.”  “Baby wait a lifetime before you find somebody new”, “Every time I pay the price for a heart that can’t be broken.” Maybe youve thought these things, and hearing them out in the open ensures I Never Learn isn’t an admission of defeat; there’s an unspoken uplift to be had, that you can only hurt this badly after loving way too hard. A chorus of Lykke Lis sing the title of “Never Gonna Love Again”, whereas the gospel choir does the same with “Heart of Steel”, either taunts or acceptance of a fate where grand, sweeping sulks are just a natural and welcome state of being. We’re used to breakup albums that assume you just want to crawl into a hole and die, but I Never Learn is for the times when heartbreak is so life-affirming that you want to share the feeling with the world.",

Following a brief resurrection as Th Corn Gangg, a live side project in which Unicorns songs were recast as backing tracks for MCs like Subtitle and Busdriver, multi-instrumentalist Nick Diamonds and drummer Jaime Tambeur announced theyd soldier on without guitarist Alden Penner (née Ginger) as Islands. To prove it wasnt just another one of their bat-shit crazy antics, they leaked two mp3s: \"Abominable Snow\", an epic about surviving a yeti sighting, and \"Flesh\", which revealed a sweaty, sexy side to Diamonds and Tambeurs songwriting. Both songs were outstanding and, just as important, sounded like the work of the Unicorns. (In fact, they were live staples in the bands last days.) But when Diamonds explained they wouldnt be on the new album and then gushed to Pitchfork about how the bands record would be, of all things, inspired by Paul Simons Graceland, it was anybodys guess as to what Return to the Sea would actually sound like.\nIt turns out that, while Diamonds Graceland references werent just snarcastic pranks, Return to the Sea is a sprawling, gorgeous collection of pop songs that draws from disparate sources such as calypso, country, and hip-hop. The record also relies more heavily on organic sounds and structure than the Unicorns LP did: Where Who Will Cut Our Hair rewarded listeners with unexpected eruptions in the middle of songs or flat-out rockers dropped off a sonic cliff into plaintive minor chords, Islands present a more linear approach in their arrangements. Songs like album opener \"Swans (Life After Death)\" propel forward, picking up steam to the point of bursting. Only after \"Swans\" has marinated for nearly seven minutes, for example, does Tambeur abandon his shuffling and stuttering beats for cathartic, straight-ahead drumming. Islands charm, then, is all wrapped up in the richness of the production: unusual instrumentation and tiny flourishes create dense compositions that demand repeated listening.\nFor example, on \"Rough Gem\"-- a song so insidiously infectious that trepanation may be the only way to get it out of your head-- the main riff is begun by an understated keyboard, picked up midway by plucked violin strings, and completed by a second, more cartoonish synthesizer. All the while, Diamonds cracks puns on his name, declaring \"Im a girls best friend/ Can you cut?/ I can cut!/ Im a rough gem.\"\n\"Volcanoes\", on the other hand, starts by layering meandering lap steel, intermittent triangle, and violins. By the chorus, those violins shed their hillbilly act to become soaring and angelic, like a melodramatic score. Against the strings, Diamonds strums chords and croons in his strained timbre, \"We washed our mouths at the riverbed/ When we noticed something glowing/ It was growing/ Things are going to change,\" before predicting a catastrophic volcano blast that melts Alaska and turns Argentina into some kind of ice land. The lyrics are ridiculous but fun, and \"Volcanoes\" fittingly features the albums most explosive finale, in which all the instrumental elements that have wandered in and out of the song converge for the songs climax.\nReturn to the Sea is a case of Diamonds and Tambeur yanking up their anchor and setting sail for new waters, enjoying the freedoms of exploration and discovery. At no point in the record does it feel as if Diamonds is settling into any one genre or style-- hardly a surprise from this shape-shifting songwriter. It wont be a shock if, say, Diamonds and Tambeur announce 18 months from now that Islands is kaput and theyre kickstarting another new band. And who really cares? As long as they continue to write songs as striking and immediate as the batch on Return to the Sea, their fans will follow them anywhere.\n ",

        "article_text": "All ye indie hacks dressed in psychs clothing oughta hang up your underused echoplexes and unprocessed Blue Cheer albums, because from here on in, yall shall be measured against Blue Cathedral, Comets on Fires blistering full-length number three.\nHyperboles a scam-- and most shameful in the voice of a seasoned critic-- but from the initial sawhorse pummeling of \"The Bee and the Cracking Egg\" to the last-gasp strains of \"Blue Tomb\", its clear this intense collection commands a sense of largess, as well as some sort of mystically heightened language. With all sincerity, I can report that these sludge denizens have burnt-to-a-crisp every ounce of ashy acidic energy currently floating around the hazy rock n roll atmosphere. Though Ethan Miller and Ben Flashman formed Comets on Fire less than five years ago, these hymns feel centuries old: Sometimes bludgeoning, always regal, Blue Cathedral is a calcified, hippified holy place. Begin your pilgrimage...\nExpanding the multi-textured promise of Field Recordings from the Sun, here Comets throw down even more explosive hyperactivity. Still nodding to Pink Floyd, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind, and the less known sounds of Monoshock, the crew lights out into its own sweaty territory. With these eight tracks, the quintets completed an impressive transformation from crunchy garage-rock stonemasons cribbing tropes to heady, mathy enfant terribles decimating Freakout City, USA.\nLike Field Recordings, Blue Cathedral was recorded at Louder Studios by The Fucking Champs Tim Green-- so theres really no explanation as to why these sounds are so stadium-sized and crystal clear. Better mics? A new dose of inspiration? More likely, its the official addition of Six Organs of Admittance raga whiz Ben Chasny on guitar two. Hed played with the band in the past, but now that he calls himself a bona fide Comet, perhaps hes allowing himself a few more aesthetic liberties. Or maybe, just maybe, leaving Santa Cruz for San Francisco and Oakland offered differently processed water and a worthwhile change of scenery. Whatever the case, the Bay Area groups purity of intention and sound is stronger here than on any previous offering.\nMusically, there are a bevy of fierce rockers, occasional saxophone distress signals, blissful chill zones: The instrumental, \"Pussy Footin the Duke\" drifts into a relaxed milky way space probe with regal organ breakdowns, tender ebony-and-ivory arpeggios, and a my-guitar-gently-weeps melodic sense. As such a title would suggest, \"Whiskey River\" features gravelly rock vocals and frolicking echoplex that twists and darts within an overhauled Southern rock template; it dissolves into the wistful \"Organ\", an anomalously brief, melancholic fit of stargazing. The spiraling asteroids of \"Brotherhood of the Harvest\" performs triumphant astronomy-- I can see the metal guys getting teary over its discordant-to-majestic ebbs and flows. The knockout punch, \"Blue Bomb\" whips up the most languidly, ecstatic opus of a career built upon such outer-realm ecstasy: Lay back and whittle acid-rock and solar boogie-woogie notations on the surface of the sun as it expands.\nBeyond individual tracks, Blue Cathedral is a well-curated whole: The song cycle mixes noise and rest with stops on a dime-- in the midst of a sludgy solo, a hook dismantles itself and reforms, turning repetition into mantra. Living up to their evocative name, Comets on Fires music is loud and harsh, and despite that Millers screamed lyrics are largely indecipherable, Blue Cathedral is surprisingly not at all difficult.\nAvoiding sentimentality and the weight of an overblown intellectual message, this hedonistic outing could bring fans of all persuasions together as one tinnitus-toting family: stoners, indie rockers, metal heads, classic rock fans, open-minded gutter punks, non-ironic mullet owners, and even your older sister will join hands and find some riff or virtuosic accent to hold close to their heart and enjoy. In anticipation of that inspired moment, lift up your warm brews and repeat after me: Heres to the hard rock album of the summer and the backyard barbecues it will inspire, and to uncontested tofu pups basting alongside all-beef hot dogs, forever and ever, amen.",

        "article_text": "It’s 2014 and there is a new Aphex Twin album, which means the most conspicuous musical drought this side of My Bloody Valentine has ended. Syro, unlike the Caustic Window LP released earlier this year, is not a collection of material cut during Richard James’ prolific 1990s heyday and shelved. It’s a new album of new music recorded in the last few years, and it’s said to be the first of more to come. Unlike MBV, it’s not that James went away entirely—in 2005, he released a series of Analord 12\" EPs as AFX, and there were a couple of low-key EPs as the Tuss. But with many-monikered electronic musicians, branding is everything: it’s not an Aphex Twin release unless it’s presented as an Aphex Twin release.\nSyro is an unusual album to contemplate because its overall approach is not particularly unusual. Older fans of electronic music who followed along with James’ shape-shifting in the 1990s may need to adjust their expectations slightly. On the evidence here, he has no interest in re-inventing his sound. Syro has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic “Come to Daddy” vocals or rushes of noise. On the other end of the spectrum, Syro doesn’t cast James in a quasi-classical light; theres no “serious composer” tracks like “4” or “Girl/Boy Song” that beg to be arranged for string quartet. And there are no “Windowlicker”-like nods to pop, no attempts to smuggle some truly weird music onto the charts.\nWithout all that, what’s left? Sixty-five minutes of highly melodic, superbly arranged, precisely mixed, texturally varied electronic music that sounds like it could have come from no other artist. James throughout the ’90s was an influence sponge; part of his genius was how he took ideas and ran them through his highly idiosyncratic filter. The bizarro highlights came when he put his own spin on genres, making jungle weirder, pop more unsettling, and piano music more gorgeous. Syro also absorbs many different sounds, from loping breakbeat to drum’n’bass to techno proper to hints of disco, but in a more subtle way. It has a way of making other genres seem like they exist to serve this particular vision. And it’s a confident album precisely because it’s not self-consciously pushing the envelope. Electronic music with a strong beat not intended for the dancefloor was, if not invented by this guy, certainly perfected by him. So with his first trip back from the wilderness, he’s demonstrating exactly how it’s done.\nSyro scans as “’90s” in terms of form but is quite modern in its particulars. Music sounded like this in 1996, but it didn’t sound quite this good. Whether James has acquired better machines or improved the way in which he records them, Syro contains some of his most tactile music; it’s a headphone record par excellence, an hour-long feast for the ears. But as exquisite as all the fragments are in isolation, the heart of the record is its steady sense of momentum, all the more remarkable since the tempos are mostly relaxed and uniform. James has spoken of tricks he uses in sequencing to free his music from a ridged digital grid; whatever his methods, his rhythmic DNA is as identifiable as John Bonham’s. There’s a playful swing to his rhythms, with accents that dance on and around the beat, and that unmistakable drive is the frame upon which the album is built.\nThe album’s formal simplicity keeps the focus on the arrangements, especially in the first half. The ten-and-a-half-minute “XMAS_EVET10 [120][thanaton3 mix]” glides forward like a smooth stone over polished ice, allowing a new element—a sly melodic twist, a stuttering shift in the beat, an unusually bassy groan—to enter seamlessly in every bar. It’s complicated but never busy, myriad parts cohering into a logical whole. “4 bit 9d api+e+6 [126.26]” mixes muted acid squelches with twinkly keyboard melodies, with barely-there voices intoning a few layers beneath, while the opening “minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix]” has wordless singing presented straight—the one new wrinkle on the album—and it’s so naked it’s disarming. The album gets a few clicks harsher in places, as on “CIRCLONT6A [141.98][syrobonkus mix]”, with its assertive bass grind and rubbery video game noises, but it never goes too far in that direction. The care and virtuosity with which these tracks were assembled is immediately obvious, but nothing feels difficult; the record’s easy flow despite it all is one of its primary virtues, and there’s something new to uncover with every listen.\nSyro’s tremendous focus on detail marks it as a more muted release in Aphex Twin’s discography. The “What the hell was that?”, once an Aphex touchstone, is nowhere to be found; there’s little here in the way of brute-force appeals to the lizard brain, and Syro is on balance more sophisticated and cerebral. And that silliness, that bratty desire to be noticed, was part of what made the Aphex Twin experience special. Some will miss it. But this record—virtuosic, precise, but also alive with feeling—has something else in mind. It’s telling that the most extreme moment here is also the quietest—the closing “aisatsana [102]”, a painfully lovely minimalist piano piece recorded on a creaky upright with birds chirping away in the background. By that moment, the feeling of “I’m listening to a new Aphex Twin album” has fallen away and the deeper beauty of Syro starts to sink in.",

        "article_text": "Lately I feel a little shaky. It rains too much and the coffees too strong and the sirens are too loud, too often. People arent as pretty as they used to seem, and on top of that theyre gradually electing the entire cast of the movie Predator to significant governorships. Minnesota, California: I think I saw Carl Weathers in Central Park yesterday with a stack of leaflets. When late November rolls around and someone asks what Im thankful for, I might just give up and say Ellen Alliens Berlinette, which has made the past six or seven months a lot nicer.\nThats the kind of love she inspires. Another Pitchforker came back from Berlin a few months ago, having seen her DJ at a party for her label, Bpitch Control, and said faux-hawked German boys had been lined up around the deck to bring her drinks. Thom Yorkes been going around talking about how great the label is, the cheat: yes, yet another cadre of ultra-fine German electronics. And earlier this year she released Berlinette, which is \"serious,\" and \"pop,\" and beautiful, and which Ive had more success recommending to people than anything in years. Its a record that German techno enthusiasts and Björk fans can agree on; it tweaks and thumps and then pulls gorgeous ghostly pop out of it; its big and solid and lovely.\nHow so? The truth is that its just enchanting, in a way that has to do with something much more than the sonic inventiveness and precision engineering that Ill have to settle for discussing here. Its rare for artists to manage what Allien does-- to take the tweaky cutting edges of techno and IDM and electro and draw from them pop music evocative enough to entrance even people who are usually turned off by electronics and \"repetitive beats.\" Its even rarer for an artist to manage that with anything like Berlinettes sense of mood and personality, which mostly transcends the mechanics of the sound. But Allien manages all of this, in about eleven different ways.\nJust try one track: \"Trashscapes\". Her beats are like tiny hypercomplicated machines, with lots of pistons and articulated limbs; \"Trashscapes\" kicks in with a stiff, daunting one, one that pounds and then hangs in the air for a second before flipping over and starting again. Then come bursts of gnarled guitar, processed into a grim, extra-terrestrial chug-- the same way Alliens vocals are always processed into what feel like departure announcements from a spaceport on Mercury. At first we cant hear her: just micro-second clips and stutters popping over the mech-beat. Then shes singing and it feels heavy but it hasnt quite gelled into sense: \"Wo is where/ What is when/ Why we are here.\" But when the guitars speed into an evil blur she comes out all steely-eyed with the records mantra: \"The past is a lighttrain to unknown trashscapes.\"\nThats what she does, on the face of it: She blurs the line between \"real\" sounds and \"fake\" ones, weaving processed patches of voice and guitar directly into the laptopped complexity of her rhythms; on \"Abstract Pictures\" its the clang of a sequencer that rings out clear and natural. On \"Push\" she indulges in the half-crazy tweakery of some of her labelmates, toying with stompy synth blurts and calling, \"Push/ Push/ Kick your ass.\" When she goes pop its not by watering down the beats and crooning seductively or anything like that; its just by gathering her steady tech throb up into gorgeous sweeps of melody. \"Sehnsucht\", one of the records other standouts, has a compositional swell thats like the best days of Orbital, another act that always had the same ghostly, personal sheen Allien conjures: the beat here is her second-best machine (see \"Wish\"), and the vocal is just another micro-processed blip, a half-syllable \"Ah.\" It stutters in and takes its shape, and by the time the song draws up, roaring, theres no lyric that could be more right than the electronically pitched melody of those half-syllables.\nBut all thats only technical. If it were just that, Berlinette would be an outstanding record, but not so outstanding as this. No, Berlinette has something extra-- the sort of mood and magic that makes you want to bring Allien as many drinks as shell let you buy her. Its in the hyper-pretty, otherworldly electro-funk of \"Secret\", in the almost Cure-like cerebral throb of \"Open\", and even in the embarrassingly bald, maybe even naïve lyric of \"Wish\", which, like any good moment of vulnerability, makes you like Allien that much more. \"Need a planet without cars and wars/ I wish it could be true,\" she sings-- an almost strange thing to hear on a record full of alien machines.\nSo thats the thrill: realizing all over again just how evocative and gorgeous the stiff clatter of technology can be. You sit calmly listening, drifting off to somewhere else, and then you notice that the little people dancing inside your head could almost be jacking their limbs off to certain points, or that the sounds of power tools are peeking out between the sounds of androids singing arias. Oh, maybe its not that amazing: Its just a record, after all, and one of plenty of great ones released this year. But Ive spent half the year with it, and it only gets better, and I cant wait to hear how it sounds in a few months, when the Predator itself announces a dark-horse independent bid for the presidency.",

        "article_text": "The Venezuelan-born producer Alejandro Ghersi, aka Arca, has got a handful of releases to his name so far, including 2012s Stretch 1 and Stretch 2, a pair of bewildering EPs that threaded glassy digital synths with sped-up vocals and choppednscrewed stutterbeats, all as twisted and contorted as the weird, milky appendages pictured on their sleeves. Beyond that, though, Arca is best known as a next-generation super-producer, or a potential one, anyway. Hes already produced some of FKA twigs best work, hes co-producing Björks next album, and he had a hand in four songs on Kanyes Yeezus.\nGhersis proper debut album, Xen, named for his ambiguously gendered alter ego, shows that his brush with the big time has not softened him. Kick drums stutter and stumble; rhythmic patterns fall apart in mid-song. A few of the beat-oriented tracks, like \"Fish\", have come completely untethered from the rigid grid that usually governs electronic musics timekeeping. Sounding like a hardstyle rework of Laurie Andersons \"O Superman\" made with a broken MIDI clock, it flaps at the edges like a tarp with a busted tent pole. Aside from a few relatively placid sketches recalling Harold Budd or Vangelis Blade Runner soundtrack, the palette tends to emphasize hammered metal, broken glass, and melted plastic; plucked tones and bent notes and nails-on-a-chalkboard sheets of dissonance. (The strident synths of \"Tongue\" sound like theyve been inspired by the shower scene in Psycho.) Taken as a whole, it is an album about unstable unities, things that cannot easily hold together, wholes breaking to pieces and being put back together again in new and unfamiliar shapes.\nEven the pacing of the album seems to move in fits and starts. From the dramatic opener, \"Now You Know\", all elastic arpeggios and rocket-launch glissandi, he feints left into the Harold Budd homage \"Held Apart\", and from there its on to the schizophrenic \"Xen\", a song divided between metallic locust-swarm passages and Fairlight fantasias flecked with synthetic birdsong. \"Slit Thru\", a downcast Dem Bow number, gives way to the languorous and atmospheric \"Failed\", a meandering synthesizer jam that wouldnt sound out of place on Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo, a mixtape of Japanese ambient pop from the 1980s. From there, the pizzicato string synths of \"Family Violence\" lead into the reggaeton-leaning \"Thievery\", the closest thing to a single on the album. And so on, all the way through the anticlimactic (but still exhilarating!) closer, \"Promise\", with its aimless string plucks and blast-furnace rumble. Xen feels less like a narrative arc than an amalgam of two- and three-minute chunks that might work just as well on shuffle. Thats not a criticism. To the contrary: the albums mazelike shape is an indicator of how much lies beneath the surface. You really could get lost in this thing.\nIts been a while since it felt like there was anything really, categorically new in popular music, or even semi-popular music. As Simon Reynolds Retromania argued, the story of the century so far has mostly been one of collaging together the bits and pieces of earlier decades. Gradually, however, it is becoming clear that something is cresting the horizon, and while its too early to make out the particulars of its shape—this lumbering behemoth with the Teflon gleam and Transformer joints and image-mapping skin—it is getting closer.\nThis new thing is not a genre, exactly; call it a style, a sensibility, a veneer. It has to do with computers and digital sound and digital imagery. It has to do with representation and malleability, the idea that sound and image can be stretched and twisted and copied ad nauseam. It revels in digital gloss and grit, in bent tones, in smeared and frozen reverb tails. Extreme compression, schizoid pith: rap vocals broken down to monosyllables, a single \"Huh\" as metonym for everything thats happened between the Sugarhill Gang and now. History reduced to a USB stick.\nIts not necessarily sci-fi in its themes—not, say, in the way that Detroit techno celebrated cybernetics and space travel—but theres still something inherently futuristic about its portrayal of technology as something tangible and even sensual, its suggestion that data has texture and heft. It spins code into a second skin. (I realize that that description doesnt sound that far off from The Matrix—a 1999 film that, these days, were likelier to read as kitsch than as prophecy—but this stuff is different; its less Keanu than Cronenberg.) You can make out its traces in the work of people like Actress, Oneohtrix Point Never, Evian Christ, FKA twigs, Berlins Janus crew, and even PC Music, and it feels like its coming to a head on Arcas Xen. The next few years—his next few years—are going to be interesting. ",

        "article_text": "The Artist takes her point of view for granted, to the extent that she annoys or confounds anyone caught up in chasing the \"truth.\" Or, she fascinates us in the same way were drawn to religious and other mystical figures. Yet, despite the cultural roles of artists as spiritual alchemists and conduits to where all of our trials and errors are given spectacular treatments and endearing portraits, we balk when they appear to have indulged themselves. Why is this? I understand that indulgence is supposed to be a sin, a crime against humanity and nature, but artists are among the very few whose responsibility for discovery supercedes an obligation to personal restraint. After all, dont they usually pay for this by existing in a perpetually tortured state? Most artists toil in obscurity, driven by nothing more than a vague compulsion to \"create,\" so self-indulgence is the least I can grant them in exchange for a few bits of divinity.\nAnd then theres Björk. She seems pretty indulgent, and despite the enigmatic, moderately antisocial persona, Ive never quite understood why I called her an artist. As artistic qualifiers go, eccentricity is beyond superficial; its downright misleading in most cases, and no matter the number of interesting musical concepts with which she aligns herself, I always figured \"real\" artists had to deliver a few concrete answers now and then. Answers, if not about my world, then about Björks. I watched her sing \"Oceania\" (the first single from Medulla, though don’t try buying it, its not for sale-- the artist strikes again!) at the Olympics, and it occurred to me that beyond the usual promotional gears at work, somebody must really feel shes important. They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyonce-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I cant argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björks significance.\nMedulla suggests that if she is artistically important-- and I should preface all of this by stating I dont normally evaluate music or musicians based on my perception of their \"importance\"; Björk simply makes it difficult to do otherwise-- its as a small scale model of the same individualist, mundane obsessions that dominate popular culture. Just as television networks bank on our interest in reality, Björks emotional impact seems dependent on ones fascination with her. Medulla (her fifth album, and first since 2001s imperfect, introspective Vespertine) presents no set of ideas more compelling than those concerning its creator, her whims and impressions. That its her a cappella record is just an interesting bonus, as its no more or less \"her\" than any of her records.\nIronically, the sound of Björk \"getting to the essence\" of herself is more dependent on outside musicians than usual. In addition to producing collaborators Mark Bell, Matmos and Mark \"Spike\" Stent, Björk enlists the vocal talents of The Roots Rahzel, Japanese beat-boxing wonder Dokaka, American freak-patron Mike Patton and English progressive pop icon Robert Wyatt, among others. Medulla is the result of concentrated efforts on behalf of the best and brightest Björk could round up, and in the spirit of her symbolic godfather Miles Davis, betrays her knack for using talent to her best advantage. Use of the human voice on this album will get the headlines, but the bulk of the story is rote Björk.\nThat said, Medulla is her most musically adventurous record since Post. \"Where Is the Line?\", featuring Pattons growl, an eerie choral arrangement and ingenious, jackhammer rhythm track powered by Rahzel and edited by Bell. Björks melody doesnt seem particularly interesting until you try to follow along amidst the cut-up beats and falling, wailing choral voices. The machine-gun-precise percussive hits, accentuated by Pattons bullfrog squelch, hit harder than anything shes done since \"Army of Me\". \"Pleasure Is All Mine\" begins as seductive, wordless call and panting, before melting into lush, gorgeously arranged harmonies and Björks dream-noir melody. She uses Pattons lower register to flesh out the arrangement, and her own singing is as powerfully resonant as anything Ive heard from her. Throughout the album, Björks commitment to bringing out the strength of her melodies, despite considerable opportunity to get lost in the wall of sound, is admirable and the mark of someone who understands the importance of serving her songs.\n\"Oceania\" has been marketed as the \"radio single,\" though with its bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples, is hardly the most obvious choice to sell Medulla. Id have chosen the considerably more upbeat \"Who Is It\", which reminds me of \"Alarm Call\" from Homogenic in the way it applies Björks idiosyncratic performances to a traditionally pleasant sounding template-- though \"Who Is It\" features a much more interesting chord progression during the verses, and an altogether incredible rhythm track, again provided by Rahzel. The only other song on the record that might conceivably work on the radio (sans remix) is the house-y closer \"Triumph of a Heart\", featuring Dokakas mouth percussion.\nThe more atmospheric songs on Medulla are arguably its most evocative and powerful. \"Vokuro\" (or \"Vigil\") is one of two songs sung in Björks native Icelandic, and is in fact an adaptation of a piano piece by Jorunn Vidar. Björk sings its plaintive strains accompanied by a solemn choir, and brings out its inherently hymn-like qualities. Wyatt overwhelms \"Submarine\" with his ghostly, striking vocals, thickly layered and overdubbed. Björk doesnt even enter with the melody for almost a minute-and-a-half, by which time Wyatt has already made his redoubtable mark. Not to be outdone, Björks collage of sighs, whispers, cries and otherwise indescribable sounds on \"Ancestors\" might scare fans accustomed to a steady diet of actual songs. It reminds me of the work of American experimental vocalist and composer Meredith Monk (Björk has performed her \"Gotham Lullaby\" in concert several times), though some folks may just hear it as the \"unlistenable\" song on Medulla.\nMedulla is an interesting record. It continues Björks run of releases that sound nothing like their predecessors, yet is, as ever, particular to her. Furthermore, shes found a way to bathe her immediately distinctive melodies and vocal nuances in a solutions that cause me to reevaluate her voice and her craft. I shouldnt be surprised: Shes made a career of making me interested in her world of sound. And that she doesnt appear to be short on ideas 25 years into her professional career should end all speculation.\n ",

        "article_text": "Look at the song title \"I Am a God\" and it seems like easy blasphemy-- Kanye Wests update of John Lennons \"more popular than Jesus\" shocker from 1966. But just as the Beatles proclamation was fuller and wiser in context-- \"I believe that what people call God is something in all of us,\" Lennon would later explain-- \"I Am a God\" is not simply the latest self-important blast from one of pop cultures pre-eminent egoists. For starters, the track sounds less triumphant than breathtakingly vexed, crashing in with a gnarled dancehall vocal sample and paranoid sawtooth synths that aim to destroy. Here, Kanye raps about loyalty, respect, threesomes, and, yes, croissants with the urgency of someone being chased by a 30-ton steamroller. The song is pierced by a series of primal screams, pixelated outbursts that are only briefly able to halt the beats heaving evil. In Kanyes hands, being a god sounds stressful as hell, something we can all relate to, and the songs apparent inspiration is a passage from the book of Psalms: \"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.\"\nThese are the immeasurably lofty stakes Kanye deals in on Yeezus, his sixth solo album. His intensity here has a heightened desperation as he howls into the void, but the Chicago native has always been beguiled by the view from above. Take \"Jesus Walks\", where he references another Psalm while gasping from on high: \"I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is/ Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless.\" Then, on \"POWER\", he contemplates leaping out of the penthouse, \"letting everything go.\" In a way, Yeezus is the panicked sound of that ensuing free-fall, a rush of angst and despair with absolutely nothing left to lose. \nThe album is something of a razor-sharpened take on 2008s distressed 808s \u0026 Heartbreak and marks a blunt break with the filigreed maximalism Kanye so thoroughly nailed on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. In hindsight, the latter record-- with its ingratiating GOOD Fridays buildup, endless guest list, and uncharacteristically apologetic interview sessions-- was his attempt at recapturing a superstar-sized American audience after a slew of entertaining-yet-questionable PR incidents. Except it didnt exactly work: While Twisted Fantasy was universally lauded and went platinum, it still stands as Kanyes worst-selling album to date, failing to produce a top 10 single. But even if it wasnt a chart smash, the intricacy and durability of Twisted Fantasy incubated the Cult of Kanye to an extreme level. \"I’d rather piss a bunch of people off and make myself happy than make everyone else happy and be pissed off inside,\" he told VIBE around the release of 808s. Yeezus doubles-down on this exclusionary philosophy: \"Soon as they like you, make em unlike you/ Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you.\"\nFor Kanye, theres purpose in repulsion. And on Yeezus, he trades out smooth soul and anthemic choruses for jarring electro, acid house, and industrial grind while delivering some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales yet. This is willful provocation that Ice Cube, Madonna, and Trent Reznor could all be proud of. Some of the record has him tackling the same issues hes been rapping about since The College Dropout, albeit with a fire-eyed stare. On his debuts \"Family Business\", he poignantly lamented a jailed cousins absence at the Thanksgiving dinner table in a manner \"so sweet, like a photo of your grannys picture.\" On Yeezus, hes still addressing the plight of incarcerated black men, but now hes incensed. With \"New Slaves\", he confronts us with vulgar stereotypes while exposing the prison-industrial complex for the deeply systemic racist sham that it is.\nMeanwhile, XXX creeper \"Im In It\" sounds like a dancehall orgasm mired in quicksand and makes previous come-ons like \"Slow Jamz\" come off like Disney theme songs. \"The kids and the wife life, but cant wake up from the nightlife,\" says the new father on that tracks knowingly button-pushing final verse. \"Im so scared of my demons/ I go to sleep with a nightlight.\" Kanye told The New York Times hes recently reached a new level of Zen, but this is the opposite of beach-chair music. Perhaps the albums most explicit lines are the blurry fantasies of a confessed porn addict whos described his daughters mother as a \"superstar all from a home movie.\" Without much room for levity, Kanyes complicated and distrustful view of women is unrelenting on Yeezus. And while theres no real excuse for flat oafishness like \"eatin Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce,\" many of the albums most powerful moments have him broken down, insecure, and bloody, railing against an ineptitude with the opposite sex.\nAlbum pinnacle \"Blood on the Leaves\" tells a nightmarish story of divorce and betrayal, all while samples of Nina Simones pitched-up \"Strange Fruit\" and TNGHTs demonic \"R U Ready\" horns play yin and yang to the protagonists alternately sorrowful and furious headspace. \"Hold My Liquor\" and \"Guilt Trip\", meanwhile, find Kanye trying to restate his manhood while his emotions crumble around him; if hes not drunk and swerve-y, trying vainly to reconcile with an ex, hes hoping to brag himself out of being dumped. Caustic humor shows up now and then, buoying certain lines or tracks like \"Send It Up\" and \"Bound 2\", but its often fleeting. As on \"Runaway\", theres something palpably sad about the men in these songs, which twists them away from misogynistic assertions of power toward feelings that are ultimately more self-destructive. As contemporaries like Jay-Z, Beyoncé, and Justin Timberlake increasingly devote their music to largely winning tales of contentment, Kanye is unwilling or unable to settle for settling down.\nThis discomfort is essential to his enduring appeal. For instance, instead of working with giant phone companies to guarantee commercial success, a la his big brother, Kanyes now making a point out of rejecting corporate sponsorship. Whether its a meaningful stance or a blindly contrarian move is up for debate. But after recent tensions between hip-hop and corporate America, visceral and disturbing lines like \"put my fist in her like a civil rights sign\" put Kanye beyond the reach of mainstream brands hoping to siphon his credibility. As he told the Times, hes not disinterested in the idea of big companies or big money-- he compared himself to Steve Jobs, after all-- but he wants control. \nThe restlessness spreads to his aesthetic and collaborative choices. Rather than relying on known hitmakers to augment his music, Kanye solicited ideas from exciting up-and-comers including Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Arca. And even veteran producers involved in the project, like Rick Rubin and Daft Punk, were seemingly chosen not for their name recognition but their history of rule-breaking. In the mid-1980s, Rubin veered away from the colorful, party-starting tones of early rap music and created bare, hard beats for LL Cool J, Run-D.M.C., and the Beastie Boys-- a perfect fit for Yeezus less-is-more snarl. And though Kanyes blaring, digitized assault couldnt be further from Daft Punks naturalistic, groove-based Random Access Memories, the artists share a basic philosophy. As Daft Punks Thomas Bangalter recently said of their new record: \"We had the luxury to do things that so many people cannot do, but it doesnt mean that with luxury comes comfort.\"\nThe idea extends to the how Yeezus treats the human voice. Running with the confounding hook from last years \"Mercy\", dancehall patois is scattered throughout, bringing with it that musics sense of menacing confrontation. And Bon Ivers Justin Vernon shows up on a few tracks, using his voice to give the darkness an angelic tint. Expanding upon the cracked vocal experimentation on Twisted Fantasys \"Blame Game\", Kanyes own voice is often shadowed by pitched-down ghouls. And though he couldve likely chosen any rapper on earth to guest on the riotous \"Send It Up\"-- probably the most likely, if not only, chance Yeezus has for a rap-radio hit-- he chose Chicagos relatively unknown King L. His presence, along with that of fellow Chi-town driller Chief Keef, makes the message clear: America may want to ignore these young black men from the gang-strewn South Side, but here, they have a voice.\nAll of these unlikely choices demonstrate how cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, perhaps more than any other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the records fast 40 minutes. The precise approach runs through Yeezus guerrilla-style promotion, too, which found an army of dark vans lighting projections onto buildings around the world, itself a boots-on-the-ground reaction to todays InstaTweet brand of music dissemination. I went to one of these impromptu happenings last Saturday night, in the middle of Manhattan. At 1:20 a.m., the words \"NOT FOR SALE\" lit up on the south side of the Louis Vuitton building. A few guys ran across the street with Christmas-morning glee, snapping photos. Then, Kanyes starkly-lit visage appeared to recite \"New Slaves\"s anti-consumerist lines as cabs streaked by the luxury stores below. His was the only black face to be seen across the jumbo ads lining an eerily desolate 5th Ave. The van soon closed its doors and drove away; the culture bomb’s flash was over in an instant, but the reverberations were just starting to spread.",

        "article_text": "How did we get here?\nOurs is a generation overwhelmed by frustration, unrest, dread, and tragedy. Fear is wholly pervasive in American society, but we manage nonetheless to build our defenses in subtle ways-- we scoff at arbitrary, color-coded \"threat\" levels; we receive our information from comedians and laugh at politicians. Upon the turn of the 21st century, we have come to know our isolation well. Our self-imposed solitude renders us politically and spiritually inert, but rather than take steps to heal our emotional and existential wounds, we have chosen to revel in them. We consume the affected martyrdom of our purported idols and spit it back in mocking defiance. We forget that \"emo\" was once derived from emotion, and that in our buying and selling of personal pain, or the cynical approximation of it, we feel nothing.\nWe are not the first, or the last, to be confronted with this dilemma. David Byrne famously asked a variation on the question that opens this review, and in doing so suggested a type of universal disaffection synonymous with drowning. And so The Arcade Fire asks the question again, but with a crucial distinction: The pain of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, the enigmatic husband-and-wife songwriting force behind the band, is not merely metaphorical, nor is it defeatist. They tread water in Byrnes ambivalence because they have known real, blinding pain, and they have overcome it in a way that is both tangible and accessible. Their search for salvation in the midst of real chaos is ours; their eventual catharsis is part of our continual enlightenment.\nThe years leading up to the recording of Funeral were marked with death. Chassagnes grandmother passed away in June of 2003, Butlers grandfather in March of 2004, and bandmate Richard Parrys aunt the following month. These songs demonstrate a collective subliminal recognition of the powerful but oddly distanced pain that follows the death of an aging loved one. Funeral evokes sickness and death, but also understanding and renewal; childlike mystification, but also the impending coldness of maturity. The recurring motif of a non-specific \"neighborhood\" suggests the supportive bonds of family and community, but most of its lyrical imagery is overpoweringly desolate.\n\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\" is a sumptuously theatrical opener-- the gentle hum of an organ, undulating strings, and repetition of a simple piano figure suggest the discreet unveiling of an epic. Butler, in a bold voice that wavers with the force of raw, unspoken emotion, introduces his neighborhood. The scene is tragic: As a young mans parents weep in the next room, he secretly escapes to meet his girlfriend in the town square, where they naively plan an \"adult\" future that, in the haze of adolescence, is barely comprehensible to them. Their only respite from their shared uncertainty and remoteness exists in the memories of friends and parents.\nThe following songs draw upon the tone and sentiment of \"Tunnels\" as an abstract mission statement. The conventionally rock-oriented \"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\" is a second-hand account of one individuals struggle to overcome an introverted sense of suicidal desperation. The lyrics superficially suggest a theme of middle-class alienation, but avoid literal allusion to a suburban wasteland-- one defining characteristic of the album, in fact, is the all-encompassing scope of its conceptual neighborhoods. The urban clatter of Butlers adopted hometown of Montreal can be felt in the foreboding streetlights and shadows of \"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\", while Chassagnes evocative illustration of her homeland (on \"Haiti\", the country her parents fled in the 1960s) is both distantly exotic and starkly violent, perfectly evoking a nation in turmoil.\n\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\" is a shimmering, audacious anthem that combines a driving pop beat, ominous guitar assault, and sprightly glockenspiel decoration into a passionate, fist-pumping album manifesto. The fluidity of the songs construction is mesmerizing, and the cohesion of Butlers poignant assertion of exasperation (\"I went out into the night/ I went out to pick a fight with anyone\") and his emotional call to arms (\"The powers out in the heart of man/ Take it from your heart/ Put it in your hand\"), distinguishes the song as the albums towering centerpiece.\nEven in its darkest moments, Funeral exudes an empowering positivity. Slow-burning ballad \"Crown of Love\" is an expression of lovesick guilt that perpetually crescendos until the track unexpectedly explodes into a dance section, still soaked in the melodrama of weeping strings; the songs psychological despair gives way to a purely physical catharsis. The anthemic momentum of \"Rebellion (Lies)\" counterbalances Butlers plaintive appeal for survival at deaths door, and there is liberation in his admittance of lifes inevitable transience. \"In the Backseat\" explores a common phenomenon-- a love of backseat window-gazing, inextricably linked to an intense fear of driving-- that ultimately suggests a conclusive optimism through ongoing self-examination. \"Ive been learning to drive my whole life,\" Chassagne sings, as the albums acoustic majesty finally recedes and relinquishes.\nSo long as were unable or unwilling to fully recognize the healing aspect of embracing honest emotion in popular music, we will always approach the sincerity of an album like Funeral from a clinical distance. Still, that its so easy to embrace this albums operatic proclamation of love and redemption speaks to the scope of The Arcade Fires vision. Its taken perhaps too long for us to reach this point where an album is at last capable of completely and successfully restoring the tainted phrase \"emotional\" to its true origin. Dissecting how we got here now seems unimportant. Its simply comforting to know that we finally have arrived.",

        "article_text": "If you know the true identity of London dubstep artist Burial, consider yourself a member of a very exclusive circle. Steve Goodman, who runs Londons Hyperdub label, knows-- he cuts Burials royalty checks, after all-- but if anyone else does, no one has yet had the temerity to out Burials inner Peter Parker. Read an interview or two with the artist himself, and youll quickly figure out why hes chosen to remain anonymous. Burials decision not to let a backstory be a part of the music doesnt come across as a strategy calculated to maximize hype, but just the opposite: a means of keeping the music pure, faceless, answerable only to itself-- a closed system.\nThe critical success of Burials self-titled first album threatened to derail the projects mystery, however. A collection of tunes recorded at home on a low-tech setup over the course of many years, Burial-- moody, brooding, by turns supple and sullen-- shot to the top of many critics best-of lists last year. To judge from a recent interview with Burial posted on the Hyperdub website, the attention was more distracting than gratifying. \"The first [album] got slightly out of where it belonged,\" he says, \"and I found it a bit difficult to just block things out and make tunes in a low key way again, and it took time to just get back to doing that, and liking it, and doing it fast, and not trying to be a perfectionist. Just trying to dream up tunes again without worrying what people were going to think.\"\nBut if its the reclusive life that Burial seeks, he might just be his own worst enemy, because his new album, Untrue, bests Burials fans wildest hopes for the followup. Burial was a worthy, sometimes thrilling record-- an impressive debut-- but it sometimes lost focus, particularly when it attempted to carve out something closer to \"proper,\" clubwise dubstep. But Untrue maintains the style and the vibe of the first album and yet does it better. Its a deeper album-- richer, more complex, more enveloping. The irony is that almost nothing has changed. Burial still makes his beats (at least, so he claims) with relatively lo-fi audio editing software, eschewing the comfort of sequencers and MIDI clocks. His string sounds, which on Burial let many a critic to call his music \"cinematic,\" sound as unabashedly canned as they did last time, and his manipulated vocals-- warped, time-stretched, pitch-corrected-- are just as unabashedly emotive.\nLike Burial, Untrue is a homage to UK garage, or two-step-- a short-lived, oft-mourned fusion of breakbeats and house music that peaked in the late 90s before morphing into offshoots dubstep, grime, and bassline house. Thus Burials beats swing wildly, as though flitting between two tempos in the space of a single bar; jittery hi-hat patterns flash like knives being sharpened, and tooth-cracking rimshots invariably fall on the third beat, dividing time in odd ways. His beats seem to rush, trying to catch up with their own out-of-control forward motion, and then-- crack!-- having caught up, they simply hang there, as though unsure what to do with the remaining time left in the measure. Its a relay race marked not by starters pistols, but stoppers pistols, leaving an impression at once rigid and woozy.\nBut what Burial gets wrong is at least as interesting as what he gets right. Where two-step was marked by its precision-- staccato sub-bass, nimble cadences, rapid-fire vocal shots-- Burial smears everything until the songs moving parts are all but indistinguishable. In \"Ghost Hardware\", what sounds like the creaking of a swingset grates in the background, as if attempting to tug the music out of its planned arc. On \"Shell of Light\", piano and strings eddy to a crawl as rain drizzles over muted, multi-tracked vocals. Theres nothing on Untrue thats likely to work in the dance club, but thats beside the point. Top-heavy with sad string passages and mournful vocal loops, Untrue is an album meant to be heard at home, in the car, on headphones-- his songs feel almost like beautiful secrets being whispered to a listener.\nThanks to Burials use of vocals, Untrue is overflowing with earworms, its spongy terrain pocked and pitted until the ground threatens to give way with every step. Its not a pop album, at least not by Top 40 standards, but his voices-- male, female, and ambiguous-- wriggle deep into the listeners consciousness. Theyre just intelligible enough to stick-- Im pretty sure that the refrain to \"Near Dark\" runs, \"I can see why I love you\"-- and unintelligible enough to resist dislodging. Occasionally paired with scraps of what might be movie dialogue, they recall the haunted intimacy of Luomos Vocalcity; like that record, they toy with r\u0026bs conventions, heavy with breath and rippling with trills and melisma, some of it digitally imposed.\nLike everything in Burials music, the vocals are supercharged with emotion: Loaded with distance, they often sound like theyve been recorded several rooms away from their source. Burial isnt afraid of sidling up next to cheesiness, practically flirting with bathos-- his string sounds are uniformly synthetic and his voices seem expressed in miniature; like Thom Yorke, he raises affect almost to the level of fetish. Burials all-permeating use of reverb could be a crutch if it didnt work so well. The haze works in his favor, leaving a level of plausible deniability-- you can never be entirely sure that what youre hearing is really there in the track, creating a wonderfully unfinished feeling to the record.\n\"Sometimes you just want music to stay where it is from,\" says Burial in his Hyperdub interview. \"I love drum \u0026 bass, jungle, hardcore, garage, dubstep, and always will till I die, and I dont want the music I love to be a global samplepack music. I like underground tunes that are true and mongrel and you see people trying to break that down, alter its nature. Underground music should have its back turned, it needs to be gone, untrackable, unreadable, just a distant light.\" Untrue is just that. It quivers like a hissing lightbulb, one that illuminates the tracks scattered around it-- garage, dubstep, soul-- and in doing so smears them into unique shapes. Untrue shows the hunched, unreadable form of Burials refusenik stance-- back turned, hands shoved in pockets-- and practically commands you to follow.",

        "article_text": "The story goes like this: After seeing an advance print of the Ridley Scott heroin-trade epic American Gangster, Jay-Z found himself inspired. The movie details the story of the Vietnam-era Harlem kingpin Frank Lucas, and Jay saw so many parallels between Lucass life and his own. Over the course of a few weeks, Jay recorded his own widescreen epic, a concept-album about the rise and fall of a gangster like Lucas, an imagined what-if trajectory for what might have happened to Jay if hed never left the drug trade.\nIt makes for a good story and a great marketing coup. By attaching himself to a big-budget crime epic, Jay guaranteed himself cross-media presence and positioned himself to regain some of the grimy credibility hed lost with 2006s Kingdom Come, the would-be comeback that found Jay rapping about brands so expensive most of his audience had no idea what he was talking about. In working to create the impression that hed sacrificed commerce for art, Jay recast himself as an artist rather than a CEO, a canny commercial move at a time when rappers like Kanye West are outselling CEOs like 50 Cent. As a piece of media-manipulation, American Gangster is dazzling. But as music?\nWell, as a concept-album, American Gangster is kind of a wash. Over the course of its first 13 tracks, the album loosely outlines the criminal rise and fall weve seen in so many movies: the desperation of youth, the excited early schemes, the slow hard-fought rise, the lavish celebration of that rise, the eventual joyless inertia involved in maintaining that success, the sudden and inevitable descent into a prison-cell anonymity worse than death. That story animates the album, but it doesnt dictate its movements. Throughout, Jay-Z breaks that narrative whenever he feels like it, taking care to force in all his standbys: The sneering aristocratic death-threats, the breezy uptempo party-songs, the (especially forced) for-the-ladies seduction-song.\nJay actually corrupts the impact of his own moralistic rise-and-fall story by ending the album with a pair of bonus tracks, \"Blue Magic\" and \"American Gangster\", that trumpet Jays own triumph over the vast impersonal forces that landed his protagonist in prison. On \"Blue Magic\", he even growls, \"Cant you tell that I came from the dope game?\" like its a point of personal pride, immediately after he depicted an inevitable criminal downfall. On his wide-scope art-piece, Jay still cant put aside commercial success and relentless self-aggrandizement, even if those twin impulses fuck up his concept.\nSo American Gangster doesnt quite work as a concept album, but its difficult to imagine the record would be better if that concept had been fully realized and fleshed-out. Jays evident obsession with the post-Don Imus furor over nihilistic rap lyrics has fuck-all to do with his gangster narrative, for instance, but Jays willingness to break narrative and address that obsession leads to lines like this one, where he calls out recent rap foe Al Sharpton on \"Say Hello\": \"Tell him Ill remove the curses/ If you tell me our schools gon be perfect/ When Jena 6 dont exist / Tell him thats when Ill stop saying bitch, bitch!\" The albums story gives it enough structure to feel huge and all-encompassing, but Jay floats in and out of it as fluidly as he switches between the first and second person. And so the drug-dealer story serves an important purpose: It rips Jay out of the royal materialistic old-man haze that ruined Kingdom Come and recalls the titanic, invincible snarl that made him great in the first place.\nOn American Gangster, hes fallen back in love with language, making slick puns and jamming his lines with internal rhymes and vivid, detailed images without letting those devices detract from the emotional punch of his mini-narratives. \"No Hook\" has some of the most complicated rhyme-patterns hes tried in years, but its all in service of a sad picture of the conflicts of anyone who makes a living doing dangerous, immoral things: \"Stay out of trouble, mama said as mama sighs/ Her fear her youngest son being victim of homicide/ But I gotta get you out of here, mama, or Im [long pause] die [long pause] inside.\" (Nobody uses long breathless pauses like Jay-Z; when hes at his best, as he is here, those silences can say as much as his words.)\nOn \"Roc Boys (And the Winner Is)\", the buoyant and celebratory ode to financial success, Jay thanks every device and corrupt institution that made his rise possible: \"The Nike shoebox for holding all this cash/ Boys in blue who put the greed before the badge.\" On \"Blue Magic\", his wordplay is so dense that it can take multiple listens to parse: \"Blame Reagan for making me to a monster/ Blame Oliver North and Iran Contra/ I ran contraband that they sponsored.\" (Maybe Im dumb, but it took me a while to realize that the second of those lines ends with the exact same four syllables as the next lines beginning.) On \"Fallin\", the song about the dealers comeuppance, Jay sounds like hes spent a lot of time thinking about the fate he avoided: \"Come January, it gets cold/ When your letters come in slow and your commissarys low.\" And on \"Ignorant Shit\", a Black Album outtake revisited and revamped here, Jay positively relishes the contradictions of rap, a genre where every artist theatrically proclaims himself to be more real than everyone else: \"Actually believe half of what you see/ None of what you hear, even if its spit by me/ And with that being said, I will kill niggas dead.\"\nMusically, American Gangster is lush and spacious. The sampled voices of Al Green and Marvin Gaye float through the record like ghosts of Jays past, sweetly offering encouragement like benevolent angels. Jays handpicked lineup of producers keep his voice grounded in thick, organic globs of 1970s soul. Diddy and the Hitmen, the reunited production who gave old Bad Boy albums their flamboyant elegance, turn in five tracks on the album, and their work drips with ambition. On album-opener \"Pray\" they outfit Jay with churning strings, screaming guitars, cinematic sound-effects, and a histrionic gospel choir; the horns, windchimes, and rolling drums of \"Sweet\" are almost exhausting in their richness. But not all the production is that warm and languid. On \"Success\", Jay and guest Nas rant paranoically over No IDs disorienting storm of organ-wails and murky, off-kilter drums. On \"Ignorant Shit\", Just Blaze layers up a furious storm of tinny synths and guitars, giving Jays shit-talk a trashy \"Miami Vice\" veneer. And \"Hello Brooklyn 2.0\", built from an old Beastie Boys track, is a stark corrective to all those florid harps and violins: all booming bass and skeletal handclaps, Jay sounding more at home than guest Lil Wayne.\nWhen Jay taped his episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" in Brooklyn last month, he kept comparing tracks from the album to moments from The Godfather and Scarface. American Gangster isnt really about Jays own memories, and its certainly not about Frank Lucas. Instead, its an album about Jays mythic legacy, his place in a pantheon of larger-than-life outlaws. Problematically enough, it works because it reconnects Jay with the verbal and musical eloquence that allowed him to escape from an outlaws life. If it took a big Hollywood movie and a half-baked concept to get him back to that, then thank God for big Hollywood movies and half-baked concepts.",

        "article_text": "In the electronica landscape of the 1990s, Daft Punk first came over as a novelty. Funny band name, funny sound, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk”, found on their debut album, Homework. They’ve come a long way since, but the playfulness remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every new step in their career, whether positive (the landmark Discovery, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert Human After All, their forgettable score for Tron), or somewhere in between (the film Electroma) has been met initially with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”\nRandom Access Memories, the fourth proper studio album from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, continues the trend. But the differences between their first three albums and this one are vast. RAM finds them leaving behind the highly influential, riff-heavy EDM they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. So we get a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For RAM, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost completely avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an album-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.\nDaft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music”. The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of Nile Rodgers followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, RAM is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s Aja and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity.\nAnother way is to work with artists young and old who have inspired them. Rodgers pops up again on “Lose Yourself to Dance” and “Get Lucky”, and on both songs he’s joined by Pharrell on lead vocals. These two songs basically find Daft Punk attempting to make their version of a Chic song, which, in itself, is not a particularly notable goal. But the French duo’s craftsmanship carries the day. Pharrell, despite being the biggest contemporary star on the album, sounds anonymous-- his vocals are pretty much just functional. But even that is arguably in line with Daft Punk’s reverence. Disco, after all, was often a producer’s medium, and lead singers weren’t necessarily meant to be the the focus of attention. So it comes back to songwriting and production: How strong is the groove, how memorable are the hooks? “Get Lucky”, a deserved hit, works on both counts. “Lose Yourself to Dance”, on the other hand, is OK, but plodding, perhaps the weakest song on the record and a good example of the potential pitfalls of Daft Punk’s backward-looking approach.\nOther songs in the record’s first half-- “The Game of Love”, “Within”, and “Instant Crush”-- don’t make a huge impression initially but are best understood as part of a broader whole. “Game” and “Within” are downtempo, slightly jazzy robotic soul, delivered in the kind of gorgeous vocoder that Daft Punk have perfected. Musically, “Instant Crush” sounds a lot like a great song by Daft Punk’s pals Phoenix, and the processed lead vocal from the Strokes’ Julian Casablancas holds a simple tune that’s catchier than anything he or his main band have managed in a while. All three tracks function well in the context of the record, throwing the tour-de-force “Giorgio by Moroder” into sharp relief.\n“Giorgio” is a stunning piece of pop-prog that seems partly drawn from the groundbreaking producer’s experiments in long-form, epic disco, like his side-long version of “Knights in White Satin”. Moroder’s only contribution to the song is an interview that offers a thumbnail history of his life as a musician, one that recounts how how he heard the sequenced Moog as the future of music (see “I Feel Love”). The construction of “Giorgio by Moroder” is masterful, moving from easygoing beats to a for-the-ages, chill-inducing synth line, to orchestral crashes, to a brilliantly goofy guitar solo. It’s a fitting tribute to Moroder’s spirit and legacy.\nRAM’s best songs come in its second half, another clue that it’s meant to be heard in full. It builds as it goes. “Touch”, the record’s literal centerpiece, is where things start to get interesting. It’s telling that the songs featuring the two oldest and deepest influences on the record-- Moroder and Paul Williams-- are the most over-the-top.  (Williams role in the 1974 cult film Phantom of the Paradise became an early obsession for Daft Punk.) These pocket symphonies allows the duo to take their concerns to the furthest reaches of ambition-- and good taste. “Touch” packs in a Cluster-fied spacey intro, some showtune balladry, a 4/4 disco section complete with swing music trills, and a sky-scraping choir, all in service of a basic lyrical idea: love is the answer and you’ve got to hold on. It’s strange, disorienting, and emotionally powerful, with a silliness that doesn’t undercut the deep feelings in the least. It encapsulates what makes Daft Punk such an enduring proposition: their relationship to cool. Their vulnerability comes from embracing cheese while also understanding the humor and playfulness in it, holding all these ideas in mind at once.\nThis quality is also heard in “Fragments of Time”, featuring lead vocals by legendary house DJ Todd Edwards. The laid-back melody embodies another often disparaged musical moment: 70s singer-songwriter excess that East Coast critics liked to write off as the sound of El Lay-- the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Michael McDonald. Conveying the openness and innocence that marked pop radio as the 70s ended, “Fragments of Time” sounds something like a sequel to Discoverys “Digital Love”. Contrasting \"Digital Love\" and \"Fragments of Time\" also raises an interesting paradox: though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more “human,” the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect. To my ears, this quality isn’t necessarily to its detriment, as much of its appeal ultimately comes from its surface beauty, the sheer gorgeousness of the overall sound. But I suspect this feeling is at the root of why, judging from early reviews, some listeners were underwhelmed.\nThe continual churn of the internet, experience tells us, favors quick connections, conveniences, ephemeral pleasures. But there are areas of culture popping up that seek to slow down, focus on details, and wallow in the kinds of media that it still takes money to create. This is the space that Daft Punk seek to occupy, which in and of itself can be seen as problematic. For those who embrace the more egalitarian approach to music production created by access to cheap tools and cheap distribution, Daft Punk’s mind-bogglingly lush record scans as elitist, possibly even dismissive of the creativity that is happening on a smaller scale.\nTo really understand where they’re coming from here, you have to go back to the height of the album era, which was really just a blip in pop music history. Three things made it different: 1) it was the time just before MTV; 2) it was the time just before the CD; 3) it was the time just before the Walkman. All three hit around the dawn of the 80s and had a profound influence on how recorded music was experienced. MTV, in addition to foregrounding the visual presentation of artists, returned music to a singles-focused realm. The CD did its part too, making skipping ahead so easy and allowing for the listener to jump around at will. (It also made artwork less important and introduced the idea of records as “data”.) And the Walkmans convenience opened up new spaces for listening while decreasing sound quality, a trade-off that has driven the technology behind popular music consumption ever since.\nSo RAM is best appreciated as a counter to these trends. It’s not that “all music should be this” but that “some music could be this.” By the time you make it to the album’s astonishing final stretch, it’s hard not to think that Daft Punk have succeeded at what they set out to do. The arrangements on \"Beyond\" and “Motherboard” are breathtaking, and Panda Bear, after many so-so collaborations, aces his vocal turn on “Doin’ It Right”, a terrifically uplifting bit of electro-pop.\nAnd then it ends with “Contact”: It’s the most old-school Daft Punk song here, and it’s also the only one based on a sample, pulling its main riff from a 1981 song by the Australian band the Sherbs. Daft Punk and collaborator DJ Falcon first used “Contact” in a DJ mix in 2002, and now it finds its way on an album about time and memory in 2013. You get a feeling of time collapsing with it, seeing where Daft Punk have been and where they could go. “Contact” will likely close some future live multimedia extravaganza, and people will go insane, and they will return to this album with new ears. You never know, but my guess is that people will be listening to Random Access Memories a decade hence, just like we’re still listening to Discovery now. You’ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, you’ll forget the day they announced the suits, you’ll forget the day the “Get Lucky” snippet leaked, you’ll forget every rumor, you’ll forget the “SNL” commercials. But the record will remain, something that channels the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery thats situated in the constantly-shifting present.",

        "article_text": "Most people attribute the National’s escalating popularity to their reliability: They write songs about existential dread and the real pressures that result when others are depending on you to have your shit together. And while that steadiness is certainly important, it gives short shrift to how the Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati band’s career fulfills a fantasy. Though their self-titled 2001 debut is all but written out of their history, every National album since has been more ambitious, accomplished, and successful than the one that came before it. They are strivers, and their place in the indie rock world suggests that life can be a series of upward promotions and self-improvement. But hard work is often a cover for repressed frustration, as was clear on 2010’s High Violet, an album whose wrought arrangements and violent lyrics underscored every story about what a tremendous pain in the ass it was to make. The question they ask on Trouble Will Find Me is both relatable and fantastical: When do we get a break from shooting up the ladder?\nThe National may find it impossible ever to relax, but they have learned to stop struggling on Trouble Will Find Me, their leanest and most aerodynamic record yet. Most descriptors of the National’s musicianship-- the exacting performances, Matt Berninger’s oaken baritone, the allegiances with the equally finicky St. Vincent and Sufjan Stevens-- can double as evidence for self-serving arguments about how they’re “boring.” The only term that’s dogged the National more than that one is “grower,” a slightly backhanded remark implying that enjoying them requires an inordinate investment, or that it’s more cerebral than physical. While the National never lacked confidence or craft, Trouble is an easily accessible and self-assured work, largely because it focuses on the visceral power of Berninger’s vocals and Bryan Devendorf’s inventive drumming. Its a sign of trust that they can convey all of their ornate and rich melancholy without every sad note being underlined by a bassoon.\nIt’s been eight years since Berninger screamed on record, and now that act appears to have served as some kind of exfoliant. (He also quit smoking in 2011.) His vocals are deeper and richer than ever, as well as more tuneful and elegant. The Nationals dirty secret is that for all of the Dessner brothers’ orchestral ambitions, these songs are simple things: Instantly memorable melodies and minimal chord progressions become familiar after one listen, and then there’s a pivot, usually undetectable the first time around, that takes the National towards one of their proprietary grand finales. The greatness lies in when the listener connects the two and realizes theyre part of the same song.\n“Graceless” perfects the kind of fist-pumping victory lap featured on “Abel” or “Bloodbuzz Ohio”, and subsequent spins reveal how expertly the build is structured. Ditto for “Sea of Love”, which incrementally wells up to a cathartic call and response that extends a hand to a slipping friend with both empathy (“tell me how to reach you”) and dark humor (“what did Harvard teach you?”). There are plenty of great little moments as well; the fractious time signatures of “I Should Live In Salt” and “Demons” pushing against Berninger’s burly vocals, a tiny, chromatic guitar figure setting “Humiliation” on a new trajectory, “I Need My Girl” expressing its nervy claustrophobia through frilly filigrees. You never lose sight of Trouble Will Find Me being the result of a meticulous process conducted by professionals, though like surgeons, chefs, or interior decorators, they trust themselves to know when to put the tools down.\nThat’s mostly true of Berninger’s lyrics as well. Trouble Will Find Me doesnt contain his sharpest writing-- in particular, “Fireproof” and “Slipped” cross over to being a bit pro forma-- but in ditching the obtuse metaphors and playing with and against type, it’s his funniest. “I am secretly in love with everyone I grew up with,” he gravely intones on “Demons”, hinting at the dominant theme of how the self-image and relationships formed during his younger, angsty years figure in to his present reality. He brings the stakes down to a tangible level, where he’s invited to nice dinners, punk parties, and meet-and-greets, only to wind up calling his wife, feeling like his presence there is all somehow a giant mistake. “When I walk into a room, I do not light it up... FUCK,” Berninger stresses in an exasperated tone as a minor chord inversion takes away the mock scare quotes during the final chorus of “Demons”, revealing the deep-set despair at the source of all this self-deprecation.\nAs usual, he’s not alone on Trouble Will Find Me. Within this elemental music, compulsions towards substances, sex, and depression are likened to swamps, oceans, and agricultural decay-- natural events tentatively contained by human will. The characters are medicated, missing, and incapable of justifying their hangovers, let alone glorifying them. On Alligator, Berninger’s sociopathic tendencies felt defiant, and some may miss that; during “All The Wine”, he drank from bottomless goblets, claiming “God is on my side.” Conversely, the narrators of Trouble Will Find Me are creatures of habit attending to dull aches; a perfunctory anti-romance is consecrated with “Tylenol and beer”, and by the next song, Berninger mutters, “God loves everybody, don’t remind me.” Where he once fancied himself a cold-blooded heat-seeker and a “birthday candle in a circle of black girls,” the isolation he now feels renders him as unique as “a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park.”\nConsidering the National can no longer be compared to anyone besides themselves, it’s fitting Trouble Will Find Me is their most self-referential album. Sometimes, they’re alluding to their image as the definitive yuppie band: Berninger calls himself “a 45 percenter,” “a television version of a person with a broken heart.” They’re also putting their own work up against the canon because they’re big enough to do it: Let It Be and Nevermind serve as paragons of stability on “Don’t Swallow the Cap”, Elliott Smith’s despondent “Needle in the Hay” contrasts with the pokerfaced “Fireproof”. Bona Drag plays during the luxurious piano mope of “Pink Rabbits”, LA Woman and Guns N Roses are given malaprop name-checks on “Humiliation”.\nOf all the references, the most powerful serves as the final line on Trouble Will Find Me: “they can all just kiss off into the air.” On a song which bemoans the futility of living in the past, here’s a band often mocked for aging with their music quoting a band often mocked for music that’s stuck in a permanent state of teenhood. It could be the funniest or the most heartbreaking moment on a record full of instances of both, a reminder that when Berninger sings “I was trying not to crack up” on the previous song, there’s two ways of reading it. On a similar topic, Ezra Koenig recently opined, “wisdom’s a gift but you’d trade it for youth,” and “Hard to Find” is a similar thought taken from a different angle. People stay down with their demons wishing for that trade to be a realistic possibility, and in the clearest terms his medium-sized American heart can muster, Berninger expresses his means of finding serenity when trouble tries to find him-- “theres a lot that Ive not forgotten/but I let go of other things.\" As a culmination and refinement of everything the National have done over the past decade, Trouble Will Find Me couldn’t be granted a more fitting mission statement.",

        "article_text": "Noah Lennoxs Panda Bear project has always been about making \"difficult\" music scan as almost radio-friendly, to translate experimental moves to a broad audience with little interest in such things. Its a strategy he learned, at least in part, from sonic forebears like Arthur Russell and Brian Wilson, along with the avant-techno types he reveres. Like those disparate influences, Lennox has used potentially off-putting compositional and textural ideas to craft some of the most inviting music of his era. In turn, hes inspired more of his own followers in the last four years than anyone might have guessed. Lennox has found himself the unwitting king of the chillwave nation, hero to a whole generation of underground kids drawn to his mix of heavy reverb, sun-woozy synths, droning kraut-surf-ambient-pop songs, high childlike voice, and psychedelic-cum-nostalgic sleeve art.\nTomboy, Lennoxs fourth solo album as Panda Bear, was mixed with Pete \"Sonic Boom\" Kember of Spectrum/Spacemen 3. And again, in a way theres little here thats any further out-there than the blissful psychedelia and dream-pop Spacemen 3 and their peers were playing in the late 1980s, a lineage that stretches right back to stuff we now consider classic rock. With its angelic choirboy harmonies over an unchanging synth buzz, even \"Drone\", the albums roughest song, is a dead-ringer for the way Spacemen 3 songs like \"Ecstasy Symphony\" merged the pop high of Beach Boys with the woozy downer feel of the Velvet Underground.\nBut despite Tomboys shorter songs and more conventional structures-- especially compared to the loose percussive jams of Lennoxs 2007 solo breakthrough Person Pitch-- hes still committed to pushing his music to strange places. And few of his chilled-to-the-point-of-entropy acolytes can match Lennox for warped hooks. Forget comparing his gorgeous voice to their mumbling. Unlike many chillwave and dream-pop artists (and Spacemen 3), Lennox is blessed with the ability to actually sing, and he knows enough about crafting harmonies to do more than vaguely nod in the direction of 60s pop. So Tomboy is a pretty singular mix of the eerie and the inviting.\nDespite the murk and terror and noise of Animal Collectives earliest music, theres never been anything particularly ugly about Lennoxs mature solo work, starting with 2004s Young Prayer. But even then, he wasnt comfortable playing the laid-back hippie stereotype thats been laid on A.C. by detractors in recent years. Young Prayer might still be the most emotionally wrenching album in the Collectives catalog, an album written by a young man wrestling with some heavy shit. Lennoxs father was dying of brain cancer while Young Prayer was being written. \"[My father] got to read the lyrics, which was the most important thing to me,\" he told me in 2005; Young Prayer was a last attempt at confirming the good his father had done for him.\nMusically, the album was the least bleak, least difficult thing an Animal Collective member had recorded to that point. But the unembellished recording-- you could almost hear the empty rooms in which it was recorded-- only heightened the fragility of the songs. \"I didnt want to spend a lot of time producing it or thinking about how I wanted to get it to sound,\" Lennox said in that same interview. \"I just wanted to get it out quickly.\" Tomboy is a much more considered record, with thickly layered psych-style production. Theres also another heavy dose of dub, the most studio-bound and effects-driven music of the last 50 years, with the kind of extreme echo that plays like an overt tribute to the very different Jamaican psychedelia of King Tubby and Lee Perry.\nBut Tomboys also something of a return to the simplicity, if not the emotionally blasted vibe, of Young Prayer after the ornate structures and epic lengths of Person Pitch. Instead of a Young Prayer we now have a \"Surfers Hymn\". Instead of a naked guitar and a lot of blank space in the recording we get a wall-of-sound rush and percussion thats like Steve Reich by way of IDM. But the spare droning quality and devotional feeling of the music remains. There was plenty of church music in the Beach Boys and Arthur Russell, too, and Tomboy has a similar quality of embracing both summer fun and hushed spirituality.\nThe trouble with recording a ramshackle epic like Person Pitch is that you set up a portion of your audience to expect the next album to be at least as grand in both scope and design. There are certainly no obvious peaks on Tomboy like \"Bros\" or \"Good Girl/Carrots\", where the 12-minute lengths announced them as attention-demanding stand-outs. So Tomboys smoothness will likely be mildly divisive among Lennoxs fans. Many might have hoped that Lennox would have recorded something less accessible to separate him from the beach-obsessed glut of bedroom pop. But the scaling back on Tomboy in no way represents a scaling back of ambition on Lennoxs part. In a way, what hes pulled off here is even more difficult. Hes condensed the sprawl and stylistic shifts of Person Pitch into seemingly tidy songs. The fact that hes able to make music thats both otherworldly and familiar-on-first-listen is something that all of his followers would like to achieve, and very few have the chops or inventiveness to pull off.",

        "article_text": "The Beach Boys come up sometimes in discussions of Animal Collective, which would seem very strange if you caught the group on the wrong record. When they get noisy and decide to experiment, theyre more Bryn Jones than Brian Wilson, but both this years exceptional Sung Tongs and the less-heard 2003 live-in-the-woods document Campfire Songs had those familiar high-pitched and intertwined harmonies. Animal Collectives relationship to the Beach Boys is unusual, though, as they dont seem particularly inspired by Wilsons compositional sense. More than anything, Animal Collective taps directly into the thing that made the Beach Boys a 20th Century American version of sacred music. Its an approach in which voices say more with music than they ever could with words, and its why the Beach Boys transcended their dorky lyrics as easily as Animal Collective transcend unintelligibility.\nKey Collective member Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) conceived Young Prayer, his first widely available solo album, in response to the death of his father, in the very house where the man passed away. Though its Panda solo, Young Prayer is easily identifiable as an Animal Collective release in the Campfire Songs and Sung Tongs mode, and other Collective members contribute here and there. I asked Lennox once if any particular Animal Collective member was the \"pop guy,\" prone to push the band to a more tuneful and accessible direction, and he denied the existence of such a creature. Comparing Young Prayer side-by-side with the Avey Tare split EP on Leaf, however, Panda fits the profile.\nThere are no song titles on Young Prayer, but it seems destined to be the kind of cult record, like Aphex Twins Selected Ambient Works Vol. II, for which listeners will make up their own. Actually, everything about it suggests cult; its the kind of record that will have a profound impact on a small number of people, be ridiculed by a few more, and never be heard at all by almost everybody. Young Prayer is incredibly personal and naked, but its also unique, and it will doubtless disappear and be rediscovered periodically as years pass.\nThough Young Prayer is extremely accessible and consists mostly of voice, guitar, and piano, the \"tunes\" are hard to source. No folk or pop music I can name is structured quite like this. In an odd way, Young Prayer seems inspired by Gregorian chant, as notes seem bent in accordance to a mysterious logic recorded in some dusty scroll. The inspiration of the mass is most prevalent on Track 7, where the deep, aquatic echo seems as if it were achieved by having Lennox sing on one end of the Sistine Chapel into a microphone posted at the other. The final track, in which Lennox sings at the bottom end of his range, sounds even more like a monk channeling a biblical precept in Latin, and augmented by two overlapping piano lines inspired by classical minimalism (the Reich homage is reminiscent of the piano line from Stereolabs \"Blue Milk\"). Its hard to imagine a more lovely or appropriate closer.\nThe arrangements are simple as can be, with the majority of the nine tracks (its a perfectly short album at just under 30 minutes) consisting of acoustic guitar and voice, and the sequencing is superb. As the second track ends at an emotional peak with the word \"rejoice,\" the minute-long guitar and piano interlude lightly carried the listener to the next, more emotionally exhausting song. And after the fourth track, which is the most evocative of Campfire Songs of anything here, with its unsteady acoustic banging and singing that seems design to disappear quietly into the night sky, a summer camp chant-and-clap canon follows to bring us back down to earth.\nWhere Campfire Songs was filled with odd overlapping harmonies, Young Prayer finds Lennox typically using a single track for vocals, alternating between a quavering tenor and an even more unsteady falsetto. The fearlessness of his singing here, as Lennox navigates odd runs and subjects his melodies to unusual effects, is the heart of Young Prayer. Hes a good singer, no question, but fortunately, he refuses to compose within his limitations. Moments such as the tail end of the first track, when he jumps up an octave to finish the phrase \"how you will know me\" (my best guess-- the diction makes precise lyric decoding exceedingly difficult) at a point a note above his falsetto range, lends a layer of incredible poignancy.\nIf Brian Wilsons ultimate goal was to create a \"teenage symphony to god,\" Panda Bear and the rest of Animal Collective realize that the liturgical part of that equation was most important. Lyrics may be hard to make out and budgets are far too low for symphonies, but the god part they have down, and those moments in life we get close to but can never quite explain inspire every note of Young Prayer.",

        "article_text": "In another world, you can imagine Chance the Rapper lip-syncing “Twist and Shout” at Chicago’s Von Steuben Day parade, surrounded by frauleins doing the money dance. You can visualize a rap game Ferris Bueller: arms outstretched to snare a foul ball, staring stoned at Seurat, ducking fascist educators, and oblivious parents with cinematic ease. You can hear his impression of Abe Froman, sausage king of Chicago, and it’s pitch-perfect.\nBarely out of his teens, Chancelor Bennett has already transformed himself from a suspended high school student to the young Chicago rapper universally adored among \"sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, dweebies, and dickheads.\" The release of last week’s Acid Rap triggered such intense demand that it crashed both hosting site Audiomack and Windy City rap agora Fake Shore Drive. Cops recently fanned Chance from two separate high school parking lots after mobs formed once kids discovered he was on campus.  \nBut life rarely parallels a John Hughes script. Unlike Bueller, Chance actually got caught skipping school, a 10-day sabbatical that inspired his first mixtape, last year’s #10Day. His neighborhood of West Chatham might not be the worst in a city whose alias is Chiraq, but it’s still South Side and far removed from baronial Highland Park. The drugs are high-velocity, the slang is crisper, and in this scenario, Cameron dies. \nThe victim was Rodney Kyles Jr., a close friend who Chance saw get stabbed to death one gruesome night. His memory haunts Acid Rap. On “Juice”, Chance mourns his inability to “be the same since Rod passed.” On “Acid Rain”, he still hears screams and sees “his demons in empty hallways.” The circumstances aren’t necessarily unique. Last year, Chicago murders outnumbered American casualties in Afghanistan. Drill stars, King Louie, Chief Keef, and Lil Durk have given the violence a public face with videos so dark they practically resemble a first-person shooter PS3 game set in Section 8.\nAcid Rap isn’t trying to be an alternative; it’s an attempt to encompass everything. There are shout outs, musical or lyrical, to practically every important Chicago tradition short of Thrill Jockey. It invites elements of classic soul, juke, gospel, blues-rock, drill, acid jazz, house, ragtime scat, and R. Kelly, Twista, and a young Kanye to the same open mic poetry night, where the kid on-stage is declaiming about what’s going unreported. Its genius is that he somehow makes this work.  \nThe structure is as expansive and freewheeling as any strange trip. Acid Rap is a less about the attempt to break on through than a way of describing the hallucinatory shades, transitory revelations, and cigarette burns of the journey. You can get off or on the bus at any juncture. There is no ideology or orthodoxy. No arbitrary binaries between conscious or gangster, apostle or agnostic. Freaks and free thinkers are accepted. Chance understands that those who are frightening are often frightened, too. He comes off as a guy who could find something in common with anyone but a high school principal. \nChance mixes nostalgia with a nasal tone as effectively as almost anyone since the Pharcyde. He’s only 20, but “Cocoa Butter Kisses” laments the days of bright-orange Rugrats cassettes and Chuck E. Cheese pizza. It could come off like sentimental back-in-the-day cliché, but there’s a street-smart edge that holds the cheesiness in check. He puts Visine in his eyes so his grandmother won’t know he’s high, acknowledges his addictions, and invites Twista to play the smoked-out, speed-rap, O.G. Jedi. \nThe guest spots mirror the funhouse characters you’d expect to meet on a memorable acid excursion. Action Bronson offers instant quotables on “NaNa”, sticking out his tongue, slicking back his hair like Rick Pitino, and peeling out in an El Camino with three Japanese lesbians. Ab-Soul plays the shadowy street pharmacist in the liquor store parking lot, opening up the trunk of his Dodge to offer grass, acid, and offside soccer metaphors. Chance’s Save Money crew partner, Vic Mensa and Childish Gambino act as effective co-conspirators.\nSome ears won’t settle to Chance’s voice. It occasionally recalls an Animaniac playing the harmonica, a scat singer with a mean soft shoe routine, and/or Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar. The latter is his most obvious immediate predecessor and clearly, Chance owes him a stylistic and conceptual debt down to the parental voicemail of “Everything’s Good (Good Ass Outro)”.\nBut Chance’s vocals are mostly modulated for effect not eccentricity. The cartoon squawk of first single “Juice” bears no resemblance to the mournful Caribbean Kaddish of “Acid Rain”. He leans on his hip-hop inspirations as homage. The intro and outro flip a Baptist hymn from an early Kanye mixtape track. The beat from A Tribe Called Quest’s “Sucka Nigga” is repurposed for “NaNa”. Slum Village’s “Fall in Love” serves as the base for “Everybody’s Something”. 2Pac gets rightful daps on “Juice”. While “Favorite Song” artfully nicks the sample from Mary J. Blige and Biggie’s “Real Love” (Remix). \nEven if the voice leaves you cold, you could be sold by the sheer sense of playfulness and love of language. Despite the weighty subtext, it’s often fun and life affirming. Chance stretches syllables to ToonTown lengths. He caroms them off each other like a pool hustler sinking trick shots. He’s a “tobacco-packing acrobat/packin’ bags back and forth with fifths of Jack.” You tend to get swept up in the youthful adrenaline rush like Lamar, mixtape Wayne, early Eminem, or Jay-Z in the ”22 Twos” era. To make sure he has his own spin, Chance stashes his own psychedelics and local slang (“thot,” “dino,” “hitters”).\nIf Lamar’s good kid m.A.A.d city stoked tension through plot cliffhangers, home invasions, and ominous minor chords, Chance’s Acid Rap is a triumph of meditative moments, open-ended quests, and brass flares. The hooks are more jabs than uppercuts. None will probably bang in a club, but most will make sense live, as chanted back by a thousand fans. \n“Everybody dies in the summer, wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it’s spring,”  \nChance sings this with funereal drone on the second half of “Pusha Man”. It’s the line that keeps sticking in my head when I play the record on loop. It’s a requiem for those already dead and a warning about the imminent carnage coming soon. It’s this fleeting spring afternoon where Acid Rap seems to take place-- the last day off before adulthood-- after you’ve realized your mortality, but before your fate has been sealed. When you aren’t sure if you’re supposed to say hello or goodbye. ",

        "article_text": "It was only last fall that Grizzly Bear released their Warp Records debut, Yellow House, but the album feels much older. An impeccably crafted psychedelic folk record, it drifts from one dream-like passage to the next. Its lyrics draw on typical relationship fare, but the delicate instrumentation is otherworldly, evoking the pastoral scenery of antique storybook illustrations. That kind of careful attention to sonic detail isnt just a rarity in independent music right now-- its practically anachronistic.\nI revisited Yellow House recently because something about Grizzly Bears Friend EP had made me curious: Although many of the new EPs tracks are credited as re-workings or alternate versions of Yellow House tunes (or of songs from the bands demo-esque debut Horn of Plenty), almost none of it sounds familiar. The tracklist suggests its just your average collection of odds and ends, but its a trick: Of the four older songs that Grizzly Bear re-arrange on Friend, three are so far removed from their earlier versions as to bear only the faintest connection to their origins-- and the one that isnt, \"Shift\", is improved so dramatically that it acquires a second life. In fact, ignore the three inconsequential covers from Grizzly Bears indie rock contemporaries and what you have is a very well-disguised, 31-minute mini-LP of newly recorded (and largely newly written) material that makes \"Knife\"-- Yellow Houses height of pop accessibility-- sound formless by comparison.\nThe schizophrenic appearance of Friends tracklist makes it difficult to relay how the record hangs together as a unified piece, or detail the radical alterations that take place within its songs. But because these traits are what make the disc more than just a budget-priced Yellow House add-on, Ill risk looking like Grizzly Bear Fan #1 and go straight for the play-by-play:\n01. \"Alligator (Choir Version)\" -- New recording (featuring Beirut and Dirty Projectors) A segue of sorts on 2004s Horn of Plenty, the original \"Alligator\" amounted to a little more than a home demo. In that skeletal form, the song consisted only of a tiny, chiming keyboard and a Spiritualized-like vocal melody sung timidly by founding member Edward Droste. It also clocked in at under a minute-and-a-half. Here, the song is dramatically fleshed-out, decelerated, and detuned, gaining tremendous weight and conviction-- not to mention an additional four minutes. Extended through a series of cacophonous build-ups and releases, and an epic bridge in which ethereal vocal harmonies give way to imposing elephant-call horns, crashing cymbals, and fluttering piano, the song finally draws to a restful close that bears no similarity at all to its humble beginnings.\n02. \"He Hit Me\" (Crystals cover) -- New recording Ive always hated this song. Since it was first recorded by the Crystals in 1962, \"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)\" has been retread to death as an ironic staple of anyone trying way too hard to be subversive. Although the shock value of its lyrics (\"He couldnt stand to hear me say/ That Id been with someone new/ And when I told him I had been untrue/ He hit me/ And it felt like a kiss\") remain its only remarkable quality, its continually dusted off and paraded around by those who dont know any better (Courtney Love, the Motels), and those who ought to (Spiritualized, Grizzly Bear). Fortunately, I was able to work past my biases and hear how Grizzly Bear reshape the Goffin/King flop as liberally as they do their own material: Writing in their own psych-drenched passages, the band reimagines the songs bouffant-haired innocence as a baroque-pop experiment redolent of the Zombies, the Hollies, or the Left Banke.\n03. \"Little Brother (Electric)\" -- New recording Though roughly the same length as the Yellow House version, Friends \"Electric\" is written almost from scratch. Now a thundering pop powerhouse, it shows Grizzly Bear at the absolute peak of their present powers. Eviscerating the songs earlier structure, \"Little Brother (Electric)\" revisits just one of the original sections, building everything around it-- including its stunning, explosive fireworks finale-- from the ground up. Here, Grizzly Bear transform from purveyors of delicate fairytale psych to steamrolling rock juggernauts, resulting in the most immediate, accessible, and concrete track in their current catalog.\n04. \"Shift (Alternate Version)\" -- New recording \"Shift\"s first incarnation was Horn of Plentys stark highlight, standing firmly on its beautifully austere melody. And because its the least modified song here, it provides the discs best illustration of the bands growth as both arrangers and musicians. Only with this versions sizable improvements are the originals weaknesses revealed. At first a tinny, abrasively lo-fi recording, the songs dreary pacing was a slog. But here, \"Shift\" trades its icy plod for fireside warmth. Better paced and saturated in natural reverb, the song thaws out and blooms in Friends most gorgeous moment: a newly appended eight-part vocal harmony cascading over guitars and pianos.\n05. \"Plans (Terrible vs. Nonhorse: Sounds Edit)\" -- Remix Throwing us for a loop, this 1:37 palate-cleanser-- a collaborative remix between Grizzly Bears Chris Taylor (aka Terrible) and ambient/noise artist Lucas Crane (aka Nonhorse)-- runs in the opposite direction from Friends other material: Rather than rearranging Yellow Houses pop-friendly \"Plans\" for maximum accessibility, they electrocute it. Using its peripheral sound effects to create a dissonant tangle of flute sounds, plucked banjo, and raw white noise, the song becomes a joking piss-take on the EPs overarching concept.\n06. \"Granny Diner\" -- Previously unreleased A perfect example of Friends album-like sequencing, \"Granny Diner\" fades in from the static of the previous track. Opening with a drifting instrumental passage and ending with a radiant Abbey Road-like song fragment that falls somewhere between \"Sun King\" and \"You Never Give Me Your Money\", \"Granny Diner\"s deadpan absurdist lyrics transcend their mundanity to become genuinely affecting through Drostes sincere, defeated vocals.\n07. \"Knife\"(Covered by CSS) 08. \"Plans\" (Covered by Band of Horses) 09. \"Knife\" (Covered by Atlas Sound) The Friend EPs only weakness, this three-song segment finds Grizzly Bears camaraderie getting the better of them. Though the disc benefits commercially and promotionally from the bands decision to afford their peers an equal opportunity in reworking Yellow House material, it sells itself short as a worthy successor. Standing in stark contrast to Grizzly Bears own reinventions, these curiosities only serve to disrupt Friends otherwise seamless, cohesive flow.\nAs for the covers themselves, CSS turn in a competent electro-pop reading of \"Knife\" before Band of Horses utterly derail the record with a brutal Disney-ized bluegrass rendition of \"Plans\". Deerhunters Bradford Cox, recording under his solo alias Atlas Sound, fares best: Taking cues from Panda Bears lovely Person Pitch, his reverb-drenched take on \"Knife\" sends breezy vocal harmonies over chiming, unidentifiable instrumentation, breathing celestial new life into the bands most ubiquitous song.\n10. \"Deep Blue Sea\" (Daniel Rossen Home Recording) -- New recording Loosely based on an age-old folk traditional, the Grizzly Bear singer/guitarists \"Deep Blue Sea\", along with \"Little Brother (Electric)\", marks Friends peak of broadened accessibility. Let this loose in a Volkswagen commercial and theres no turning back. A signifier of how much headway the band has made over the past year in the way of perfect, focused melody, the sleepy acoustic lullaby gently tucks in Friend and turns out the light.\n11. [Hidden Bonus Track] Crashing in shortly after \"Deep Blue Sea\"s pacific close, Friends hidden bonus track is a jolting, last-minute surprise. A collaboration between Grizzly Bear and Beiruts Zach Condon, the raucous, fast-paced instrumental is one part Morricone spaghetti-western, two parts Sublime Frequencies field recording. The most staggering and left-of-center experiment from either band, the track sounds colossal despite its 83-second runtime. It also demonstrates the envelope-pushing Grizzly Bear can inspire, and how far they can travel outside their comfort zone without getting lost.\nThen again, thats largely what Friend as a whole establishes: More than a willingness to share their spotlight with like-minded pals, the title evokes a strengthening artistic bond between four forward-looking musicians who, as this disc makes easy to forget, found each other just three years ago. That an EP of this nature would showcase such an extraordinary leap forward in conviction and virtuosity is practically unheard of-- after all, these things are typically treated as commercial dustbins for outtakes and leftover scraps. But Grizzly Bear is a different beast, and in putting the same care and devotion into this project as they would any other, theyve shown that the title applies not just to their musical allies, but to their fans as well.",

        "article_text": "Heres an incomplete list of the subjects dealt with on Passion Pits second album, Gossamer: immigration, alcoholism, economic disparity, suicide, mental illness, drugs, domestic abuse. So when Michael Angelakos sings, \"Im so self-loathing that its hard for me to see,\" that should come across like a tremendous understatement. But two lines later, he cries \"no one believes me, no not a single thing.\" That part cuts deep, since Passion Pits 2009 debut LP, Manners, was an often dark and troubled record a lot of people chose not to take seriously due to its sugar-smacked synth pop and countless product placements. So its no wonder that Angelakos next words are \"my brain is racing and Ill feel like Ill explode!\" Three difficult years in the making, Gossamer is an overwhelming album about being overwhelmed, a bold and ultimately stunning torrent of maximalist musical ideas, repressed anger, and unchecked anxiety.\nPerhaps its fitting that Gossamer, so focused on failure and human frailty, should begin with a stumble. \"Take a Walk\" is a fairly by-the-numbers Passion Pit song. Nonetheless, theres a strange imbalance to it. The massed chorus of chipper vocals and the stoic, pavement-pounding verse feel mismatched. And while Angelakos literal account of the financial troubles facing his family is gut-wrenching and brave, it amounts to a curious fit on an album thats otherwise entirely personal. As a one-off, it would be an intriguing character study. As the leadoff track on Gossamer, it feels misplaced.\nLuckily, \"Ill Be Alright\" doesnt allow much time for the disappointment to register. The joy-buzzer synths and Angelakos falsetto scan as instant-gratification Passion Pit, but on both a musical and lyrical level, its a raising of the bar, far more complex than anything the band has done to date. Consider the combination of its surging chorus and the synapse-frying barrage of microscopic jumpcuts, and you might have the weirdest and catchiest band on Warp, and the most dejected if youre really paying attention. The first line of \"Ill Be Alright\" could be a retroactive assessment on the day-glo Manners, asking \"Can you remember ever having any fun?/ Cause when its all said and done/ I always believed we were/ But now Im not so sure.\" The effect is initially disorienting and uncomfortable: Do you escape into the comforts of the music or give into the lurid thrill of confrontation?\nAngelakos is no pop subversive. While hes been forthcoming about the autobiographical details that inspired Gossamer, within the auspices of Passion Pit, he seems incapable of dealing with them through anything other than pops pleasure principle. This was true of the now comparatively restrained Manners, an album of strong melodies that worked in a fairly narrow stylistic range. On Gossamer, Passion Pit recast themselves as polyglots and pacesetters, tackling the currency of pop music head-on as a competitor rather than admiring it with a few well-placed press quotes. Gossamer is rife with dichotomy, one of which is that the hooks highest in fructose are lent to songs dealing with the most uncomfortable topic: money. While \"Carried Away\" proves Angelakos might not be Ezra Koenig in terms of cleverly deconstructing the interactions between the socially stratified, theres a thematic congruence in the occasionally forced rhyme within a song about saying all the wrong things. Later on, \"Love Is Greed\" is far more multi-layered than its title and hook (\"If we really love ourselves/ How do you love somebody else?\") initially indicate. Courtship is reduced to the search of \"another person thats just yours for the taking,\" which is essentially a trenchant distillation of post-recession social science.\nGossamer does have humor in its perspective, but surprisingly little joy. As the penultimate track, you might expect the rafter-reaching chorus of \"Its Not My Fault, Im Happy\" to deliver some kind of relief amidst the litany of disappointments and misunderstandings, but this is a record about things not working out as expected. It leads into the disquieting calm of closer \"Where We Belong\", where the title is explained by a blatant suicide pact (\"And then Im lifted up/ Out of the crimson tub/ The bath begins to drain/ And from the floor he prays away all my pain\"). Meanwhile, \"Mirrored Sea\" siphons M83s rocket fuel and throws everything in reverse, a paralyzing descent into realizing the impossibility of escaping the lingering failures of youth (\"Slipups in this town are like a sentence to life/ Like overhead insults or a cheating wife\"). The overload of digital shoegaze abates for the message of a dispassionate vocoder: \"everyones alone.\"\nIf only it were that easy. Were Gossamer simply played out in Angelakos head, it would probably turn out insufferably self-obsessed and tuneless like so many other \"difficult\" second albums. Though it doesnt make Gossamer a happy record, Angelakos writes with a truly affecting ability to make unflinching acknowledgments of his demons effects on those closest to him. A substantial portion of Gossamer is simultaneous love letters and apologies addressed to his real-life girlfriend, and naturally theyre couched within Passion Pits most complicated arrangements to date. \"You never once controlled me/ When all the others told me/ That if I kept on going Id be dead,\" he sings before the platinum-plated wallop of a chorus on \"Cry Like a Ghost\", an admission that takes on a menacing tone as the bridge finds him awake from a blackout (\"She says I screamed and that I raised my hand/ I never meant to, I wasnt even there\").\nBeyond that brief bit of violence, the love songs are desperate and very, very drunk. Were a more composed R\u0026B singer given the liquid slow-jam \"Constant Conversations\", the sophistication of Angelakos melodic transitions might overshadow a devastating verse detailing a remorseful alcoholics account of a tired partner emptying drinks and issuing ultimatums: \"If theres a bump in the road, you fix it/ But for me, well Id just run off the road/ But tonight youve got me cornered/ And I havent got a place to go.\" It makes the context of \"On My Way\" almost unbearably intimate, Angelakos proposing, \"well consecrate this messy love,\" in a voice overpowering the delicate music-box arrangement of bells and whirs with promises of a better tomorrow.\nAnd is that ever a mission statement for a record of passionate reactions to a messy life. Angelakos puts so much of himself into Gossamer that it couldnt help but be riddled with all-too-human imperfections: Sometimes you wish hed pick a cleverer lyric, tone down the falsetto, or at least realize that it might be in his interests to try to be cool for once. Because even though Gossamer could not be more overt in its exploration of profoundly adult and bleak topics, all some people might choose to hear is how most of the melodies could still sell childrens cereal.\nWe expect this sort of masculine reckoning from the likes of Matt Berninger, Britt Daniel, Bill Callahan, Hamilton Leithauser; gaunt, brooding men whose vocal austerity and general presence convey authority and wisdom. \"Lets not try and figure out everything at once,\" Berninger sang on \"Fake Empire\", and it was a comforting statement from a guy who sounds like hes figured things out.\nBut Gossamers music is meant to reflect its sense of encroaching panic, where you really feel like youll explode if you dont figure out everything at once. Angelakos sings variations on \"Ill be all right\" and \"everything will be OK\" throughout, but theyre not so much reassurance as commiseration. Its unclear whether youre supposed to cry on his shoulder or vice versa, but it actually makes Gossamer more reassuring. Anyone can manufacture hope through a slogan, but theres an empathy and humanity that simply cant be faked as Angelakos tries to figure out how to stay atop his life. Its hard to think of a more noble goal for a pop album.",

        "article_text": "Theres an intimacy to Sam Beams voice that makes it shamefully easy to imagine him curled up in the corner of your futon, slurping tea from a chipped mug, absent-mindedly fiddling with an old acoustic guitar and scribbling words into a coverless notebook. He is always chewing on a pencil, and when he talks, his words come slow.\nShake it off. While the idea of Sam Beam tugging at your afghan might seem perfectly inviting, its actually just dangerous: the traditions and artists of the American south have long been fetishized and vilified with equal fervor, and, perhaps appropriately, both the region and its inhabitants are starting to assume near-cartoonish proportions in print and onscreen. Unsurprisingly, Iron and Wines grubby campfire hymns are subject to the very same kind of blind, moonlight-heavy romanticizing-- which might make swallowing a new, gently-buffed Iron and Wine album doubly difficult. Picture crisp, fuzz-free vocals and gently brushed snares shooting like darts, incisive and stinging, each chiseled tip dipped in hot studio poison: This is not the Iron and Wine of yesteryear.\nWhen The Creek Drank the Cradle puttered quietly out of Sub Pops warehouse in 2002, it was stupidly easy to be tugged into the quasi-escapist, heavily idealized portrait of Beam-as-basement-troubadour-- a bearded, southern, \"down home\" father of two with a cardboard box full of shitty equipment and an unassuming shoulder shrug. The whimsical inadvertence of Beams debut-- and the vague sense that the composition and realization of Creek were just as profound and accidental as the records eventual distribution-- lent Beams work a dangerous edge of serendipity. Listening to The Creek Drank the Cradle felt like accidentally digging up a diamond, clutching it briefly in a soil-streaked palm, and then shoving it deep into your front pocket, eyes shooting around suspiciously. Nobody who found it ever wanted to give it up.\nLast years The Sea and the Rhythm EP, which featured five previously unreleased Creek tracks, saw Iron and Wine maintaining his four-track sigh, bringing his hissing home-studio work to a glorious, satisfying end. For Our Endless Numbered Days, Beam darted out of his basement and into Chicagos Engine Studios, and the resulting record sees Beam taking a satisfying break from air-conditioner-as-rhythm-section: Producer Brian Deck (Califone, Fruit Bats, Holopaw) folds in twittering percussive bits, while sister Sarah Beam coos sweet harmonies and bandmates Jonathan Bradley, EJ Holowicki, Jeff McGriff, and Patrick McKinney provide ample backing. Our Endless Numbered Days is cleaner, more diverse, and generally sparser than its predecessor, and, given the apparent limits of Beams former setup, its also an astoundingly progressive record: Beam has successfully transgressed his cultural pigeonhole without sacrificing any of his dusty allure.\nOpener \"On Your Wings\" mixes Beams pert guitar picks with rolling slide; scraps of percussion gradually fold in, vocals fall off, and the band somersaults into a comparably raucous mini-jam. In \"Naked as We Came\", Beam nods to the albums enigmatic title, softly lamenting mortality (\"One of us will die inside these arms/ Eyes wide open, naked as we came/ One of us will spread our ashes around the yard\") over Creek-ish acoustic strums, while Sarah whispers along, her barely audible murmurs more haunting for their delicacy. \"Each Coming Night\" is instantly moving, perfectly hinged on a bubblegum melody, while \"Sodom, South Georgia\" nails gothic disquiet both on and off the page (\"All dead white boys say, God is good/ White tongues hang out, God is good\").\nStudio tweaking aside, theres another, more subtle tonal flip here: Beams lyrics, once dribbling over with issues of faith and fidelity, are distinctly more guarded, a switch which seems inextricably linked to the relative (and unexpected) ubiquity of his debut. Creek was full of gently whispered secrets, each tiny, grinning confession or perverse admission only adding to the records furtive charms. A sizable audience might not have been part of Beams songwriting equation before, but it is now-- and while Our Endless Numbered Days lacquered cuts might seem slightly more transparent at first, their lyrics are infinitely more obscured, heavy with their own predestined publicity. Now, Beam juggles bits of dialogue (over half of these tracks feature extra speakers; \"Naked as We Came\" and \"Each Coming Night\" both focus almost exclusively on clips of conversation), painstakingly easing himself out of the narrators chair, and voicing what would otherwise be some wincingly maudlin bits (see \"I want your flowers like babies want Gods love\").\nObviously, none of this makes Beam any less of a poet; if anything, Beams freshly veiled lyrics have simply pushed Iron and Wine toward more subversive levels of storytelling. The song-as-poem critical course has been applied to Beam before, but the accuracy of the analogy never wanes: Beam and Deck toy with syntax and meter, using shaky bits of percussion, volume shifts, and tempo changes to mimic the twitchy movement of the best epic poetry. In the past, Beams lyrics have proved his linguistic prowess, but its the eerie lyricism of the instrumentation that ultimately pushes Our Endless Numbered Days deep into the canon of American verse.\nSlavic poet Charles Simic talks about poetry as \"a table on which one places interesting things one has found on ones walks: a pebble, a rusty nail, a strangely shaped root, the corner of a torn photograph.\" And its in this sense that Beam is, above all else, a poet: His tabletops are littered with gritty little snapshots of life well-lived, strewn with tender acoustic strums, pictures of the ocean, shaken maracas, mothers, fathers, arms. Its a beautiful display.",

        "article_text": "While few are responding to The Passion with the same intensity that New York Times columnist Frank Rich did a week ago-- for starters, Rich titled his harangue \"Mel Gibson Forgives Us for His Sins\"-- its fair to say that, recently, the American public finds itself thinking more deeply about the tensions that can surface when religion and art intersect so explosively. Yet, from an art-historical perspective, its the dissociation of the two, not the intersection, that has always been most curious: Relatively speaking, only recently have religion and high art not been commonly joined at the hip. Religion has always served as an inspiration and benefactor of art, a fact which has made it all the more amusing when people criticize The Passion as an awful film purely because of its religious content-- they might as well pass over, among others, the Laocoon statue, the Sistine Chapel, Bachs St. Matthaus Passion, and practically every Dostoevesky or Joyce novel.\nThat said, skepticism still greets the release of Seven Swans, Sufjan Stevens sparse and intimate fourth album, in which the Detroit-raised Brooklynite deals with the stories of his Christian faith most directly. Which is not to say that Michigan and its tales of personal grief and acceptance of ones suffering were any less Christian in ethos, just that Seven Swans is so topically concerned with Christianity that a few wrong steps could easily have been a disaster. Religious content, by its very faith-based nature, is passionate and fantastical, and, if not fashioned with a commensurate degree of care and artifice, the emotion exceeds the form, throwing the listener headlong into the realm of melodrama and self-parody (confer all \"Christian rock\" bands).\nFrank Rich himself talks of The Passions unbridled over-the-toppity, the film \"constructed like nothing so much as a porn movie.\" Where The Passion fails artistically for Rich is not in its highly charged subject matter, but in its crudely considered execution. On similar grounds, Seven Swans partly succeeds for me because Sufjan rarely steps foot in the excess of pedantic preaching, despite the openly Christian nature of his lyrics here. At their melodic cores, the songs on Seven Swans are equally as potent as those on Michigan, though perhaps a little rougher around the edges and generally more sparsely arranged. The raw simplicity, coupled with the stripped-down, banjo-led instrumentation, lends Seven Swans a particularly high degree of sincerity: Even if were not taken by the subject matter, were taken by how beautifully and personally Sufjan is taken by it.\nOn songs like \"All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands\" and \"To Be Alone with You\", Sufjan does well to collapse the distinction between divine- and human-directed affections-- his \"You\" could apply to God and loved one alike. Especially in the former song, which opens Seven Swans, Sufjan showcases his curious ability to change a songs grief-stricken tenor to a hopeful one on the flash. The opening moments prove this eloquently: As Sufjan sings, \"If I am alive this time next year,\" his weary banjo accompaniment slowly imbues the line with convincing optimism, a progression that continues throughout the song with similar effect as Sufjan is joined by a breathy background chorus from Elin and Megan Smith and drummer David Smiths labored tympanics.\nBecause Sufjan commits himself so rigorously to this sparse, acoustic compositions, those few moments when electric instruments are used are particularly powerful. The first comes in \"The Dress Looks Nice on You\", in which tandem plucks and sweeps of guitar and banjo are suddenly contraposed midway against a quirky Casio keyboard breakdown. A second comes during the vaguely alt-country lullaby \"Sister\", which positions a light, nondescript jangle behind a screaming electric guitar that arises from the swell to become even more lively and expansive as the song builds on its repeated anthem.\n\"Abraham\", \"Seven Swans\" and \"The Transfiguration\" confront religion most directly, and to varying success. In \"Abraham\", Sufjan briefly recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith to sacrifice his son Isaac (\"Take up on the wood/ Put it on your son\"), leads Isaac up a mountain and prepares to kill him as commanded before God sends an angel to intervene. (See also: Leonard Cohens beautiful \"Story of Isaac\".) Musically, the song marks the lowpoint of Seven Swans: Sufjans vocal melody is well-delivered but somewhat impotent, and the backup chorus seems incongruous given the subject matter.\nAs the last two songs on the album, \"Seven Swans\" and \"The Transfiguration\" seem to work as a pair. Both are of relatively epic lengths and movement-like constructions, and as equal statements of faith-- the fear-inspiring \"My father burned into coal,\" and the comforting \"Have no fear! We draw near!\"-- they dovetail perfectly. First, \"Seven Swans\" is a dark, brooding anticipation of the Apocalypse in which Sufjan begins with a foreboding banjo line, only to be swept up in crashing storms of resonant piano and a terrifying octave-jumping chorus of \"He is the Lord!\", easily one of Seven Swans most memorable moments. \"The Transfiguration\" follows immediately on the bittersweet note of Jesus requisite suffering, the song performatively ebbing back and forth from major to minor chords as new melodies and instruments are stuffed into the mix.\nGiven Sufjans ability to handle such dangerously effusive material as his own religion so well, its no wonder that he aligns himself with the similarly concerned writer Flannery OConnor, whose short story, A Good Man Is Hard to Find, is recast here from the perspective of OConnors Mephistophelic character, The Misfit. OConnor, as the late Yale professor Robert Dubbin noted, is unusually capable of masking the Christian mechanisms at work in her stories without cheapening them-- she effectively crafts Christian revelatory experiences into ones of universal enormity and applicability. The same comment could very well apply to Sufjan Stevens on Michigan and Seven Swans alike: A gifted musician to begin with, Sufjan invites not our religious conversions, but our innate human compassion.",

        "article_text": "Though he lacks the crossover name recognition of producers like the Field, Burial, and Lindstrøm, Germanys Hendrik Weber is one of the leading figures in modern techno. As Pantha du Prince, he has up until now released two albums of meticulous, minimal-inspired house music. The last, 2007s This Bliss, found the rare balance between ambient sweep and dancefloor bounce, and its only grown in stature since its release. In part because of a move from the smaller Dial Records to Rough Trade and guest spots from some indie heavyweights, his new LP, Black Noise, is being met with more excitement this time around. And with good reason: Said to be born out of a period of musical exploration in the Swiss Alps, the record is both a stylistic departure for Weber and an extension of what he already does well.\nWeber is unlike most minimal techno producers in that he doesnt look to locate one groove and ride it for the course of a track. His songs open up, unfurl, and regularly change course. With Black Noise he develops this to incorporate a wide range of sounds-- field recordings, atonal noise, and stray percussion all populate the album. Above all, here he aims to reproduce sounds already in nature, and where This Bliss was airy and celestial, this record is gritty and earthbound. Its darker, more forceful, and more chaotic.\nFrom the first moments of opener \"Lay in a Shimmer\", its clear that were in for a different kind of Pantha du Prince album. The track begins with a cluster of noise-- crowd voices, clanging scrapes, the rev of a car engine-- before building into a groove of low-end synths and glistening bells. While the core arrangement is still carefully constructed and precise, the clamor around it makes the song far looser than anything Webers done to date. Subsequent tracks also strike a balance between the natural and electronic. \"Abglanz\" combines woodblock percussion with a gritty dubstep instrumental, and \"The Splendour\" (which features !!! and LCD Soundsystem bassist Tyler Pope) sets pinball plonks loose over a muted minimal backdrop.\nThe album moves through a few distinct phases while maintaining this earthy, psychedelic quality. In its middle section, starting with \"A Nomads Retreat\", Weber plays with asymmetry and extreme textural contrast. He puts gravelly bass next to reverberant synths in a way that shouldnt work but does. He revisits the icy atmospheres of This Bliss toward the end of the record, rendering them grainier but equally haunting. On the gorgeous \"Welt Am Dracht\" and closer \"Es Schneit\", eerie vocals drift over taut drum programming and shredded synths flutter around like pieces of confetti. During both stretches, the songs tear and split at certain points, giving way to pockets of noise that reinforce the albums overall theme.\nIronically the only track to stumble is the one that will likely attract the most new listeners. \"Stick to My Side\" is Webers much-drooled over collaboration with Animal Collectives Noah Lennox, but oddly it doesnt come together like one would hope-- Lennoxs traditionally warm vocals sound detached from Webers chilly arrangement. Thats disappointing considering the duos combined potential, but its not enough to derail what is otherwise an exceptional record.\nAt 70 minutes, Black Noise is a big, dense listen but also the kind of album that rewards investment. Each track is its own micro sound world with enough rich detail to draw you back for deeper investigation. The album is undoubtedly a success for Weber-- if not an outright step forward, then a graceful lateral one-- who probably could have gotten away with not making such a comprehensive shift in sound. Instead he chose to deconstruct his signature style, and the result is strikingly unique.",

        "article_text": "There are plenty of synth and drone artists that make epic, transportive music, but one of the unique things about Tim Hecker is his conceptual ability. Each of his records, from the cinematic rush of Harmony in Ultraviolet to the dreamed-up cartography of An Imaginary Country, explores a specific theme, often in great detail. When he talked to us last month about the artwork for his latest LP, Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker mentioned that hed been consumed with the idea of sonic decay. \"I became obsessed with digital garbage,\" he said. \"Like when the Kazakstan government cracks down on piracy and theres pictures of 10 million DVDs and CDRs being pushed by bulldozers.\"\nThat idea, the notion of music as a cheapened, battered object, touches nearly every aspect of Ravedeath, 1972, a dark and often claustrophobic record that is arguably Heckers finest work to date. The album is based on a single days worth of recordings in a church in Reykjavik, Iceland, where Hecker used a groaning pipe organ to lay down the foundation for its tracks. (Throughout, you can hear the vastness of this place, as sounds ricochet around, bounce off the rafters.) With help from Iceland-based producer Ben Frost-- whose ominous By the Throat is a touchstone here-- Hecker then finished the record in studio, digitally adding synth wash and wailing shoegaze crunch to his live recordings.\nThe result is a strange hybrid that lives somewhere between the digital and material realms, and its remarkable how seamlessly the two are combined. For example, in a track like \"In the Fog II\", its difficult to distinguish between the organic church sounds and the processed ones that came after. But while there is harmony between the source material, Ravedeath, 1972 is by no means about prettiness or tranquility. Hecker pits noises against one another in such a way that creates a constant push and pull between discord and beauty. Its a bit like William Basinskis Disintegration Loops, but instead of music aging over time, this is far more combative-- like these songs are being attacked from the inside out.\nIts an unusual concept but relevant given the rate at which music is consumed and discarded these days. More important than the records ideology, though, is what Hecker does with it-- the weight, atmosphere, and contrast he builds into these songs. Take for example the \"In the Fog\" suite, where over three tracks, Hecker lets dissonant squall threaten an undulating organ drone until its taken over by wailing guitar noise in third passage. Or the two-part \"Hatred of Music\", which recalls an Oneohtrix Point Never synth shimmer before it disintegrates into distant industrial creaks. In each case its not just about the wild, unearthly sounds he creates but the force with which they move around the mix.\nHecker is also smart with pacing and knows when to dial things back or add in softer, interstitial numbers when things start to become overwhelming. Thats the case in the records back half where he uses open-ended pieces to achieve the same foreboding effect. \"Studio Suicide, 1980\" is almost dreamy but has a sinister undercurrent, sounding something like the more punishing moments of My Bloody Valentines \"Only Shallow\" heard through the walls of a neighbors apartment. I wouldnt go so far as to call songs like this and \"Analog Paralysis, 1978\", which has a similar celestial vibe, \"ambient,\" but they are subtler than those in the first half and give the album a sense of balance and a natural arc.\nIf you buy into the concept of Ravedeath, 1972 as an examination of music threatened by technology, there are pretty clear threads that pop up over the course of the record to support that. For one, it seems that the organ sounds Hecker captured back in that Rejkjavik church represent a certain purity of sound and that the digital noise battering it throughout act as the enemy, the corrosive effect. Theres an ongoing struggle between the two thats mirrored in the menacing song titles and gripping cover art. Its important, then, that the album closes with \"In the Air III\", a track that features almost no interference whatsoever, just the plinking organ by itself. If Im reading it right, it feels like Heckers point is that music, in its purest form, survives no matter what you throw at it.",

        "article_text": "Depending on whom you ask-- and even in which country you live-- \"pop\" can mean a lot of different things. Its a word thats been demonized and marginalized, especially amongst stodgy and often conservative U.S. rock critics. Values, and the means in which theyre defined, have been frequent talking points in the past couple of weeks, both in the rockcrit world (thanks to Kelefa Sannehs recent New York Times Arts cover story on rockism) and in the nation at large (oh, you know). In each case, the conservative factions have framed their dialogue in pretty knee-jerk terms. Most rock critics views of unity, it would seem, arent dissimilar to George W.s-- in the best Christian tradition, its achieved through converting the heathens and savages. Just as our family values are apparently now defined by bigotry, fear, and ignorance, so too is \"phony,\" \"plastic,\" \"inauthentic\" pop music.\nWell, fuck all that: Just as (to borrow Biblical terms) ideas like love, hope, brotherhood, and charity should be central to American values, pop is musics culture of life. Its a celebration of togetherness, the sound of universal pursuits and needs such as truth and beauty; of seeking a sense of self and, when desirable, giving yourself over to the crowd; of wanting to dance, smile, laugh, love, and be loved-- and it undiscriminatingly expresses it all to loads of people in a few short minutes. Before Sunsets Jesse may have been talking out of his ass when he said his next novel was going to take place within the span of a single pop song, but theres something lovely about the idea. And anyway, maybe its not so far-fetched to live a large portion of your life in a single song: Anne Lilia Berge-Strand has done it-- though not out of choice.\nMs. Berge-Strand (Annie to her friends and the record-buying public) believed that her debut record would have been released years ago, but fate intervened when her musical and romantic partner, Tore Korknes (Erot), died in 2001 from heart complications at the age of 23. The pair had only recorded one track, 1999s vaguely dubby electro-house love song \"The Greatest Hit\", an intoxicating clubland \"duet\" between producer and vocalist. The single-- along with Erots solo work and that of fellow Nords Röyksopp-- helped launch Tellé Records and, thankfully, is included here alongside another dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annies breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals.\nWhether due to Annies backstory or not, theres a palpable sense of melancholy permeating this album. Shes at her most confident while dispensing romantic advice to herself on the playful, wobbly Richard X collaboration \"Chewing Gum\", but on \"No Easy Love\", as she struggles to maintain hope in a search for love and grapples with the netless tightrope of commitment, Annies voice barely rises above a whisper.\nIn addition to Erot and Richard X (who also co-wrote the winking, seductive \"Me Plus One\"), Anniemal features a trio of tracks produced by Röyksopps Torbjørn Brundtland, and a handful created with Op:l Bastards Timo Kaukolampi. This all-star team of Northern European electro-house producers infuses the record with often low, rumbling bass, twitchy synths, and an oddly high-altitude light-headedness-- like floating, high on oxygen, just above a dancefloor. \"Always Too Late\" lurches like a cross between Missy Elliott and UK garage and \"Come Together\" is pure acid house retro, but most of the sonics shade closely to each producers already signature sounds.\nFor her part, Annie will likely draw comparisons to Kylie Minogue and Saint Etiennes Sarah Cracknell. Such talk is most likely a slap at each artists relatively thin vocals but, like the other two (especially Cracknell), Annie coaxes quite a bit from her cellophane pipes and transforms her weakness into strength. Annies vocals cant help but hide the senses of sorrow and vulnerability that run through her songs, and that makes her urge to get herself back up off the wall and reclaim her once-shattered life all the more touching. And unlike Kylie, who exists in a celebrity neverworld, or Cracknell, who manages to make familiar settings seem like the most glamorous places in the world, Annies tracks navigate the typical urban worlds of bars, cars, clubs, flats, and high streets. She dreams of \"Top of the Pops\" and gives herself romantic advice in the mirror, yet her world should be pretty familiar to much of her audience-- sometimes achingly so.\nIt all peaks with \"Heartbeat\", one of the tracks Annie recorded with Brundtland. Last month, Pitchforks Nick Sylvester said he thought it was the best song of the year, and I agree. On one listen, it doesnt sound like the best song of the year: It doesnt do the things that year-defining tracks are supposed to do-- break new sonic ground or spearhead a trend or paradigm shift. No, what it does better than anything this year is what great pop often does: It articulates our most basic desires in an almost irresistibly catchy package.\nThe track itself narrates a party, drinks with friends, and the thrill of a first encounter-- all that many people want from a night out. It communicates a love for music, friendship, and connection, and celebrates the moments when all three merge perfectly. The tracks rhythm is obviously supposed to mirror the songs title, and that could have been cloying or heavy-handed, but when that rhythm quickens and doubles its pace as Annie catches the eye of and moves to the beat with another partygoer, it becomes a deceptively simple and surprisingly beautiful articulation of basic human need, beautifully encapsulating every element of human excitement-- guilt, nerves, excitement, hope. The culture of life.",

        "article_text": "Chaos theory regards systems, and the idea that any simple one you can think of-- say, the world, or a rock band-- will generate irregular behavior born from decidedly \"regular\" conditions. Textbooks sometimes talk about chaos in terms of fluctuating animal populations, unpredictable weather patterns and \"strange attractors\", but its everywhere, all the time. And paradoxically, theres order in it. If you put a thousand people on a deserted island, theyll turn into a society. It might seem hard to predict what theyd do for more than a very short period at a time, but if you graph their behavior, they start to look pretty orderly. Computer programs help diagram elaborate formations of tiny spirals that form massive, spiraled fractals to describe, say, the economic tendencies of your new, island society. Chaos is an attractive idea, not just because it often seems to match with daily life experiences intuitively well, but also because it feels like something nature has been trying to tell us all along.\nFor all their unpredictable behaviors, Brooklyns Excepter has individual parts that are easy enough to see. John Fell Ryan (ex-No Neck Blues Band), Dan Hougland, Macrae Semans, Caitlin Cook, and Calder Martin are-- along with groups like Wolf Eyes, Black Dice, Gang Gang Dance, and Sightings-- the new sound of chaos. They share musical similarities to This Heat, Can, and Faust, in as much as most bands playing \"fractal noise\" (what I would call Excepters sound; \"fractal\" representing the idea that ordered patterns arise from disorder) are similar to them. However, thats not the same thing as saying those bands necessarily influenced Excepter. Rather, they are all in the continuum of musicians exploring/exploiting chaos in rock.\nSo, yeah. Sounds kind of complicated (or just convoluted), right? Its not, really. From the seemingly limited array of possibilities that should come out of five people playing \"progs\", sampler, synth, and percussion, comes a bizarre artifice, albeit with a beautiful intrinsic logic. Excepter are \"important\" to me for the same reasons I believe theyd be important for anyone into the idea that music can represent culture, in the most general way-- so general, in fact, that its hard to see unless you step back to look at the patterns. None of this is to say Excepter are trying to be chaotic or noisy; rather, their kind of organization is born from kernels of sound allowed to branch out into (near) infinity, restricted by nothing more than its own feedback-- much like the chaotic behavior of economies or weather.\nFusetrons CD issue of KA (originally on vinyl in 2003) includes Excepters incredible 2004 Vacation EP. It makes a very convincing case that the superficially, peripherally related worlds of electro-acoustic improvisation, IDM, psychedelic rock, and minimalism can not only be joined, but done so in a fashion both natural and ingenious. \"Vacation\" and \"Forget Me\" are particularly so, and comprise some of the most fascinating music Ive heard this year. Over a simple, persistent drum-machine pulse, disembodied voices, both male and female reverberate through clouds of synth and echoed timbales. The tonality is decidedly major, but with sharp minor-7ths straight out of Cans \"Quantum Physics\" from Soon Over Babaluma. In fact, if you can imagine that piece slowed down by half, but twice as dense, youre getting close to \"Vacation\". Its impenetrable in the best sense.\nThe rest of KA is less attractive but hardly less interesting. \"Shattered Skull\" features more ghostly voices, but replaces rhythmic pulse with the ebb and flow of a two-note loop and shaken percussion, sounding like blades of dry grass tied together. \"See Your Son\" is similarly mysterious but spookier, eventually converging on a chorus of voices in no particular harmony except during random, brief consonant asides. \"Be Beyond Me\" brings the drum machine back, though the feel of the track is turbulent where \"Vacation\" had been sublime. The track fades out in a drone, attaching a subtle synth pattern to the bass drum pulse in a way thousands of minimal techno tracks have, but never approaching watercolor bliss; rather, its an imperfect model of repetition and mood. The one-minute \"Breast of the Wave Offering\" obscures the pulse by muffling the entire production and drenching it with bass drone and what sounds like homemade electronic squeaks. It segues into the wild \"The Fire and the Wood\", behaving like the unhinged cousin of Black Dices Creature Comforts, digital animal kingdom and all. The untidy patterns are everywhere and chaos abounds.",

        "article_text": "When underground metal bands appeal to non-metal listeners, its often because theyve found a way to tweak, expand, or do away with genre conventions. Outside of iconic heavy classic rock or shiny mainstream metal, this doesnt mean the music is easier to listen to as a result—theres the collaborative art-drone of Sunn O))), as unlikely a crossover band as any, and Deafheavens blend of shoegaze guitar textures and screamo/black metal vocals. Its rare that a contemporary group remains entirely in the metal world and still manages to find an audience outside of it, but the vintage-doom players in Pallbearer have done just that. Their ascension started with their debut, 2012s excellent Sorrow and Extinction, and with the release of their brilliant second album, Foundations of Burden, its easy to imagine them gaining even more popularity.\nWhen the Arkansas quartet put out Sorrow, they had already built excitement in the metal underground based on a three-song 2010 demo; but for most people, the five-song, 49-minute LP—with its gorgeous guitar tones and sky-soaring vocals—was their first taste of the group. Pallbearer ended Sorrows thank you list with \"and, of course Black Sabbath,\" which made perfect sense because they appeal to that diverse cross section of people who also thank Black Sabbath for their own personal reasons.\nTwo years later, theyve returned with a collection that feels even more connected to the pure, unadulterated aspects of doom, and Pallbearer have transcended the need to thank anyone but themselves. The group were given a bigger budget from their label Profound Lore to record Foundations, and they did so with Billy Anderson, who also sat behind the controls for the classic Sleep oeuvre and has recorded seminal works for High on Fire, Melvins, Jawbreaker, and others (including Red House Painters, whos early material had a sense of space that makes sense in this realm).\nIn an interview I did with Pallbearer co-founder/co-lyricist/bassist Joseph D. Rowland, he said Anderson told them hes never recorded a band that used so many guitar tracks—an element of Pallbearers sound that explains the massiveness of Foundations, as well as how they saw   Sorrows successes as an opportunity to deepen and strengthen their craft. This is an ambitious record that doesnt feel at all over-worked or stale, and while Sorrow and Extinction holds up beautifully two years later, Foundations is the stronger collection to the point that Sorrow almost comes across as demos for this new material.\nThough Pallbearer arrived fully formed, vocalist/guitarist Brett Campbells stirring voice was a little pitchy live, suggesting that he was sometimes straining beyond his abilities. When I reviewed Sorrow, I said that \"Campbell has been described as a young Ozzy Osbourne, and that influence is certainly there, but imagine if a young Ozzy had the ability to transform into Geddy Lee.\" His singing on Foundations has more ease, soul, and grit, and he sounds steadier, smoother, and more assured. It helps, too, that bassist Rowland and guitarist Devin Holt offer their own vocals on three tracks, adding details, depth, and complexity to the melodies. When they join Campbell, you get the sense of a madrigal, with overlapping harmonies that will give you goosebumps. You get a taste of it right out of the gate on the 10-minute opener, \"Worlds Apart\", a song that features cascading three-part vocals powering upward between layered guitars that crunch at the same time as they soothe. On \"The Ghost I Used to Be\", Rowlands screamed vocals mix with Campbells more honeyed voice, creating a raw, almost punk dynamic for Pallbearer that didnt exist previously.\nTheres dense, regal play all over Foundations: guitars collide, a Rhodes adds subtle details in the distance. There are new textures, bigger tempo shifts, and dynamic turns. Its a great headphone record, but youll want to be listening to these songs in a larger room where you can move around and make contact. Where Sorrow often felt like a great solitary album—especially in its focus on death and mortality—Foundations is clearly built for larger communal spaces, as even the quiet moments are massive. Pallbearer are patient, and the textures they build feel painterly (kudos to Anderson, many times over). There are moments where things drop out, like on \"Watcher in the Dark\", where you get some low-level fuzz accompanied by Mark Lierlys nimble drumming (hes a more agile, technical player than original drummer Chuck Schaaf). When the rest of the instruments return at full volume, its physically impossible not to want to move. In the same song, theres a limber guitar solo over gentle piano parts; elsewhere, synthesizers hum, bells chime, the band showcases a newfound swagger to go with the psychedelia and 70s prog.\nThe musics catchy, too, and full of hooks. Pallbearer are proud fans of rock groups like Boston and Rainbow, and these songs, while long, go down easy. As Rowland told me, \"[Our songs] are all almost exactly three times the length of a standard pop song, almost to the second, so I decided that thats our version of writing pop songs.\" With the twinkling three-minute \"Ashes\", you actually get to hear them doing doom-as-dusky ambient pop.\nRowland has talked about how Sorrow was focused on a loved ones death, and that the subject matter of Foundations is more varied; even so, these songs deal in ashes, formless voids, feasting on blood, time crushing things, and in general, loss. Still, its never a bummer. In \"Worlds Apart\", Campbell sings \"Where lays our heart of hearts defined/ My darkness and your light, still yet remain entwined.\" This mixture of light and dark seems to be the crux of Pallbearer, a group who make sadness seem uplifting, darkness seem bright, and songs about mortality seem life-giving. The final words of the album are: \"Were always shifting/ And always becoming.\" The sentiment comes during the stampeding moments of the heady, muscular \"Vanished\", and that endless becoming is fitting on both an emotional and conceptual level. Foundations finds a band firing on all cylinders, and surpassing what seemed like a watermark for the genre. As obsessed as Pallbearer is with endings, the music here is timeless.",

        "article_text": "Mutual Benefit’s proper debut LP Love’s Crushing Diamond can be described in a number of simple ways: loving, patient, warmhearted, unfailingly hopeful. Pretty much the utmost qualities you’d want out of a human being, right? Those descriptors are certainly less trustworthy when applied to art, as they’re often considered the byproducts of complacency, or at least a warning sign. Whenever a band comes along that people tell you is “necessary,\" they’re probably ripping shit up, telling you what to think, espousing conflict against music and listeners that got a little too comfy. Mutual Benefit isn’t revolutionary and Love’s Crushing Diamond is not going to judge you. But in no way is Jordan Lee a complacent songwriter. In fact, throughout this collection of seven gorgeous, baroque-folk songs, he’s dealing in perhaps the most pervasive and difficult internal battle of all: how can you be a loving, patient, warmhearted and unfailingly hopeful person in an environment that makes it far easier to not give a shit?\nA good start is to surround yourself with fellow warriors of the meek—Mutual Benefit brings to mind the “collective” format, “Animal” or otherwise, that played a large role in defining the tone of indie rock during the early 2000s. Think of Microphones, Sparklehorse, Danielson Famile, Akron/Family, early Sufjan Stevens and Devendra Banhart, where an open-ended “band” surrounds a central voice seeking to explore the ideas of what “folk” or roots music really means. Mutual Benefit certainly qualifies, though not in the way that equates “folk” with rusticity, an acoustic guitar and rigid verse-chorus structure. Songs invariably rise out of twenty or so seconds of everyone getting situated, tapping out piano riffs, trying to get the percussion in rhythm and determining who’s going to sing. From there on out, there’s often contain one central melody and a clearly elucidated mood that spools throughout, while the arrangements are surprising and intuitive, like everyone involved might be swapping instruments as it goes along.\nThe sound here is proudly analog, though not lo-fi, and Lee’s songs are thick, but not dense. Beginning with his lightly enunciated vocals, soft strands are collected and continuously bundled throughout and nuzzled by reverb without being smothered by it, a big ball of sonic yarn to fall into. Some curious threads peek through to add a shock of color: the banjo lacing Lee’s awestruck infatuation on “Advanced Falconry”, household percussion clacking throughout “‘Let’s Play’/Statue of a Man”, gentle, female harmonies and a steady drum machine tick lending comfort to a wayward drug addict on “That Light Thats Blinding” and an indeterminate synthesized instrument playing the glowing riff that explains the title of “Golden Wake.\"\nOn that particular song, a riverside meditation leads Lee to quitting his job and realizing “we weren’t made to be afraid.” That’s a major part of the plot engine in cubicle revenge fantasy Office Spaceand a motivating thread throughout the majority of chillwave, another genre thought to be a reaction to an increasingly hostile and hopeless time for socioeconomics. But Love’s Crushing Diamond is not folk in the escapist sense either, though it was recorded during a “year of notable absences” in San Diego, Austin and Boston. Many of these songs take place in mundane, unglamorous locales—city trains, mining towns, cornfields, motel rooms. And in Lees point of view, you need to discover a little space within those places that you can call your own and then invite some people to share it with. Yeah, it does skew kinda hippie, as Lee’s lyrics detail picking roses by the lake and how a river can’t help but keep on keepin’ on. That’s perfectly fine within the scheme of Love’s Crushing Diamond, which always sounds populated in a way that stresses its central themes of getting your own shit together so you’re better prepared to care for someone else.\nThis kind of perspective gives Mutual Benefit an unintended timeliness as well. As much as you want to consider music objectively, without some kind of sociological context, think of it this way: when Sufjan, Animal Collective and freak-folk came about, any afterglow of post-9/11 togetherness had given way to a terribly divisive and dirty presidential election, an escalating, vaguely defined war and a general sense that the country was being bullied into submission from the inside. This sort of music would inevitably be criticized for being apolitical and wimpy, but having seen where all this aggression got us, how could Sung Tongs or Cripple Crow not seem like the solution?\nLove’s Crushing Diamond works in a similar way and opens itself up to some of the same criticisms, when being positive is the quickest way to have your sincerity questioned. Lee concedes these points without giving in, and makes the case that kindness is in no way a sign of weakness: Diamond’s seven-minute, closing reverie “Strong Swimmer” acknowledges that it takes an Olympian level of strength to swim against the tide of negativity, but it’s the only choice. During “‘Let’s Play/Statue of a Man,” Lee sings “There’s always love/when you think there’s none to give”, true whether it’s “tattered, strained or torn.” I can’t think of a statement that sounds more necessary.",

        "article_text": "The first line on Perfume Genius third album, Too Bright, is a basic observation, one weve heard a million times in songs: \"I can see for miles.\" Mike Hadreas, the Seattle songwriter behind the project, sings it over a spare piano, something that wont surprise people familiar with his music. The sentiment, though, is a bit unexpected: Hadreas has made a habit of writing powerful, intimate, and sometimes introverted songs that look closely at his inner life, warts and all, and at the inner lives of the people around him. These words find him peering outward.\nThe rest of the lyric finds Hadreas acknowledging the cliché, and averting his eyes: \"I can see for miles/ The same old line/ No thanks/ I decline.\" What he sees is an \"Angel just above the grid/ Open, smiling, reaching,\" but he rejects it. Later he uses the line again, on the raucous \"Grid\", with the same decision to look away. At that point, though, \"There is no angel/ Above the grid.\" Its been replaced by \"A diamond/ Swallowed and shit/ Then swallowed again.\" He adds: \"At least we know where its been.\"\nAll of this is important to consider because Too Bright is, by far, Hadreas most extroverted album to date, a record about shattering illusions, defiantly looking away when you feel like it, and boldly staring back at those who hate you. Its also about personalizing your experience, and rejecting the clichés placed on it by outsiders. As Hadreas has explained, \"A lot of these songs are me trying to claim some power in situations that would typically depress or alienate or victimize me...Ive seen faces of blank terror when I walk by. Sometimes from seemingly strong, macho dudes—somehow my presence confuses and ultimately scares them. There is a strange power to it that Ive only recently begun to understand and embrace.\"\nToo Bright follows 2012s excellent Put Your Back N 2 It, a quiet record that offered variations on a central sound; sonically, Hadreas pushes things much further here. He recorded Too Bright with previous collaborator Ali Chant and Portisheads Adrian Utley, who also played bass and synth. Additionally, PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish plays drums on a number of tracks that, fittingly, are reminiscent of fuzzed-out Harvey songs. There are still elemental, stripped-down moments, but the sound is generally denser and weirder. For the first time in Hadreas career, hes giving equal time to the textures as he is with his words. That said, his vocals are more muscular, too, more clear and naked-sounding. His voice takes on a shape-shifting quality on Too Bright, sometimes warping into odd, ambient shapes; on the finger-snapping \"Fool\", his powerful falsetto sounds like it could fill a cathedral and then crack it in half.\n\"Queen\" features heavy, fuzzed bass along with synthesized vocal choirs and rhythmic oomph backing the great, cocky line, \"No family is safe, when I sashay.\" The frenetic, fucked-up \"Grid\", with immense banshee howls, horns, and repetitious, burly bass is reminiscent of Swans (the video, on the other hand, resembles Tom Pettys \"Dont Come Around Here No More\" as done by David Bowies Ziggy Stardust persona). On \"Im a Mother\", Hadreas performs muffled, creepy falsetto that sounds like Antony whispering beneath a pillow. The title track is a ballad with piano and Hadreas crystalline voice, mixing in chiming clarinet, synth washes, and escalating ghost choirs; \"Longpig\" possesses a booming 80s synth line, ricocheting handclaps, and violent burts and blooms with lines about burying meat for mama. As on Put Your Back, theres a sock-hop quality to many of these songs, especially the closer \"All Along\", but the structure is toyed with and flayed, shifting on a dime.\nThe approach to writing lyrics here is more elliptical and mysterious, too. There isnt the same kind of fleshed-out narrative storytelling found on previous highlights \"Mr. Peterson\" or \"Dark Parts\". These tracks often zero in on overall textures, but this doesnt mean the lyrics arent nakedly intimate. \"I wear my body like a rotted peach/ You can have it if you handle the stink,\" he sings on \"My Body\". On \"Queen\", he tosses out and reinscribes gay stereotypes: \"Dont you know your Queen?/ Ripped, heaving/ Flowers bloom at my feet/ Dont you know your Queen?/ Cracked, peeling/ Riddled with disease.\"\nThere are brilliant insights and images that reveal themselves over multiple listens. On \"Fool\", he makes a dress, lays it out on \"the couch you bought,\" then bleeds out on that couch in one version and dances in another. He finds power in being able to hold the hand of the man he loves, no longer needing to keep secrets: \"I carry their names, the secret shapes/ An aching braid around my heart/ Traced in the park, an outline I chalk.\" And, as he sings on the closing track, \"All Along\", \"I dont need your love/ I dont need you to understand/ I need you to listen.\"\nHes also shifted his look to match his new sound. In the past, Hadreas donned cozy sweaters and black hoodies; on the golden cover of Too Bright he looks buffed and polished, and in recent videos hes wearing smart suits and designer clothes with colorful splashes of makeup. Hes always had a knack for the quietly devastating; there was his basic, simply shot, romantic, and playful video for Put Your Backs \"Hood\", with the beefy gay porn star Arpad Miklos (who committed suicide a year after the clip), and Hadreas and his mother climbing into a tree at the end of \"Dark Parts\", a song in part about her being molested by her grandfather. Here, he finds a way to maintain that personal feel while strutting down a board room table in high heels.\nHadreas sexuality is obviously a huge part of his work, but hes above all a human—one whos spoken about battling addiction and sickness and sadness, and one who possesses the ability to write about it in a way that feels universal. A huge part of what makes the work so strong is the generous human spirit that bleeds into it, and Too Bright is the best example to date of the lengths he goes to confront his fears and demons. These songs feel less like songs and more like treasures, ones that fill you with power and wisdom, and as a result, Too Bright seems capable of resonating with, comforting, and moving anyone whos ever felt alienated, discriminated against, or \"other-ized,\" regardless of sexual orientation.",

        "article_text": "Darren Cunningham is one of those dance music producers who has spent most of his career moving away from the dancefloor. The London-based artists first two albums as Actress, 2008s Hazyville and 2010s Splazsh, sounded like mid-1980s house and techno collaged together and played on a radio from under the freeway. Half of his newest, R.I.P., doesnt even have beats. Listening to him discuss his process making it-- which included reading John Milton, philosophizing about death, and smoking weed-- youd think he was a PhD candidate.\n\"I want to make cool, classical stuff for a modern generation,\" he said in a recent interview. The phrase \"classical stuff\" alone will probably disqualify him from the academy. Good. Its not where he belongs. Like Oneohtrix Point Never, what makes Cunningham special is that hes an artist capable of referencing extroverted, populist music like house and rap in order to create a meditative, introverted experience.\nIn general, his productions are less about their build-and-release than their atmosphere, which hovers over the bones of the music like some sick gas cloud. The innovation on R.I.P. is to put as much effort into making things clean as making them dirty, and the result is a sense of contrast: Fog gives way to clarity; fat, puffy synthesizer sounds play off pinprick-sharp ones. Like all good contrasts, its simple and eureka-like: By bringing the acidic sounds to the surface and keeping the air-conditioner hum somewhere in the depths, Cunningham takes the monolithic sound of his earlier productions and breaks them into layers-- compared to Splazsh, its practically prismatic.\nIts not the sound that makes the music, though, but the structure of it. R.I.P. is a deliberately uncoordinated album. Rhythms, basslines, and melodies slip in and out of line with each other. Comparatively straightforward, house-oriented tracks like \"Shadow From Tartarus\" are situated next to murk and ambience like \"Tree of Knowledge\". The emphasis here, though, is on \"comparative\": Even R.I.P.s steady 4/4 tracks sound grimy and deconstructed. But theres something almost flirtatious in the way he lets the sounds worm around in the dark, looking to hook up with something firm. When they do, its both mechanical and mystical, like watching a sculpture cut from raw stone. \nThe thick crud over Cunninghams earlier albums mimicked a sense of loss and erosion, as though hed found the music abandoned in an alleyway and brought it back to something resembling life. The disparate sounds on R.I.P dont need resuscitation, just room to breathe. Given that room, they arrange themselves. If the album could be called intimate, its paradoxically because theres so much distance and disconnect to it. Listening to it can be like seeing the city you live in from a plane: You cant reach out and touch it but youre comforted by how manageable and well-planned it all looks.\nCunninghams scope is already wider than producers like Burial or Zomby, who tend to keep dance musics vocabulary intact, even at their most abstract. When Splazsh first started going around, Cunningham called it \"R\u0026B concrete,\" which, as marketing speak, was terrific, but as self-description was mostly aspirational. On R.I.P., the blending between the traditions of techno and the traditions of ambient and minimalist music are more apparent. Until he comes up with something better (or it ends up being used for a soda campaign), \"cool, classical stuff for a modern generation\" will have to work. As for his shift in focus, he confesses to not getting quite as stoned as he used to. The fresh air has done him good.",

        "article_text": "As a rapper, Mississippis Big K.R.I.T. is pretty good but nothing amazing: With the empathetic warmth in his sticky drawl, he makes a convincing Southern everyman, and he has enough rhythmic dexterity to really stick to beats. On the new, free-for-download mixtape Return of 4Eva, he invests the cars-and-girls talk hes already been doing with a sort of conscious-rap sensibility; toward the back end of the tape, he leaves behind boasting to talk about poverty and racism and materialism, sometimes coming up with a truly evocative line. But hes also lost some of the snarl that made his delivery so great on tracks like last years Curren$y/Wiz Khalifa collab \"Glass House\". He can get a bit clumsy when he tries to transform himself into some kind of loverman. And even in his strongest moments, he still sounds a whole lot like T.I. without much of T.I.s effortless, charismatic confidence. He could still become an excellent rapper, but it hasnt happened yet.\nAs a producer, though, hes good enough that he could be half a Ying Yang Twin and his music would still be well worth the hard-drive real estate. On last years free online album K.R.I.T Wuz Here, he marked his place in a lineage of organic, soul-sampling Southern rap producers that includes giants like Pimp C and Organized Noize, making hard-thudding personalized version of the tracks he mustve heard growing up. On Return of 4Eva (still free, still online), he progresses even further, turning his sound into a sleepier, woozier flutter-- a comfortable bed for his voice to sink into. Refracted versions of guitar and organ sounds wind their way through oceans of bass, all building into a perfectly evocative, nostalgic sound. Every once in a while, hell come with something harder, like the skeletal keyboard bloops of \"My Sub\" or the horn-and-organ thunder of \"Sookie Now\". But for the most part, he focuses on turning classic Southern rap sounds into comfort-food background music-- the sort of thing that sounds absolutely gorgeous in a car on a warm spring afternoon, when youre driving slow with the windows open. Theres a reason that Return of 4Eva dropped just as the weather was getting warmer.\nIn a sense, Big K.R.I.T. is like a hip-hop version of a group of rock revivalists. The same way that, say, Band of Horses turns dusty Neil Young guitar epics into something simple and comforting, K.R.I.T. trades on our collective memory of mid-90s Southern rap and turns that into brilliant invitations to nostalgia. At the end of \"Sookie Now\", we hear a sample of Don Draper philosophizing in \"Mad Men\": \"There is the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash-- if they have a sentimental bond with the product.\" K.R.I.T. included that sample to draw attention to his younger rap peers; hes the type of old soul who still complains about \"ringtone rappers\" sometimes. But it could just as well describe the Pavlovian attachment some of us have to a beautifully looped-up soul sample. And Return of 4Eva is absolutely packed with cascading looped-up falsetto harmonies. Sometimes, it feels like a set of variations on the beat for OutKast \u0026 UGKs \"Intl Players Anthem (I Choose You)\". And since \"Intl Players Anthem\" is one of the greatest rap songs of the past 10 years, thats no complaint.\nReturn of 4Eva doesnt have too many guests, but most of the people who do show up are Southern rappers who peaked maybe seven years ago: Chamillionaire, David Banner, even Ludacris on a remix of last years \"Country Shit\". All those guys sound reinvigorated; K.R.I.T.s amber-hued production gives them a context that just works for them. And one of the real revelations here is K.R.I.T.s own singing voice. Taking on a few hooks himself, hes got a thoughtful, bluesy coo that seems custom-built for his tracks. Its fun to imagine what might happen if K.R.I.T. teamed up with an honest-to-god great rapper for a full-length. He and Yelawolf have been teasing a mixtape together for a while, and that could be incredible. But for now, Return of 4Eva, all glowing warmth and lazy-afternoon drift, stands as one of the finest rap releases of 2011.",

        "article_text": "Slidin. Ramblin. Driftin. Movin. Strugglin. The War on Drugs frontman Adam Granduciel is all of these things on Slave Ambient, the Philly outfits second full-length release. Given these professed feelings of restlessness and uneasiness, its no surprise the bands hypno-roots-rock is all about forward motion and momentum, favoring steady, locomotive rhythms that rarely pause or waver-- elements that reinforce Granduciels efforts to make his problems disappear in the rearview mirror.\nSlave Ambient shares several qualities with its 2008 predecessor, Wagonwheel Blues: a sense of open-freeway abandon and splendid isolation set against a glorious expanse; an unabashed admiration for FM-radio Americana icons of yore (Springsteen, Dylan, Petty); and a willingness to buff the bands gritty edges with serene, if randomly deployed, instrumentals and reprises. In other words, the War on Drugs still deal in \"excellent road trip music,\" as Pitchforks Stephen Deusner described Wagonwheel Blues. However, this time Granduciel is less interested in documenting the environmental and economic travesties he sees unfolding outside his window as he is the internal dramas swirling around in his head. Nearly every song here expresses some desire to get outta town and start anew.\nThe band responds by amplifying the more textural qualities of their sound: dreamy synth drones, liquefied electric-guitar leads that linger and fade like raindrops rolling down the windshield, and the most tasteful use of smooth saxophone this side of Kaputt. (Interestingly enough, Slave Ambient was recorded without founding member Kurt Vile, who applies a similarly lysergic approach on his latest solo release, Smoke Ring For My Halo-- for fans of rustic rocknroll, the two albums collectively yield an embarrassment of riches not experienced since Wilco and Son Volt released A.M. and Trace in tandem.) When the bands wide-screened psychedelic flourishes are fused with Granduciels well-worn Dylan- and Petty-isms, songs like \"Brothers\" and \"Its Your Destiny\" wondrously conjure nothing so much as the Traveling Wilburys recording for mid-1980s 4AD. Or in the case of the excitable \"Baby Missiles\" (a holdover from last years stop-gap Future Weather EP), its as if the Spiritualized and Springsteen albums filed alphabetically next to one another in your record collection had melted together on a hot August afternoon.\nBut as much as the War on Drugs make music to accompany an escape to something better, theyre the sort of band that believes the journey is more important than the destination. The songs on Slave Ambient dont necessarily end in a place very different from where they began, but through subtle sonic manipulations and layering-- like in the last two minutes of opener \"Best Night\", where the guitars, piano, and melodica start to blur into the same blissful wavelength-- they give the impression that a great distance has been traveled. The really amazing thing about the album is how anthemic and affirming it feels despite the near total absence of proper sing-along choruses. Case in point, centerpiece track \"Come to the City\" is all about ascension, rising out of the miasmic haze of preceding interlude \"The Animator\" and gradually accruing all the confidence and verve of Live Aid-era U2. But rather than work up a chest-thumping, Bono-worthy wail, Granduciel is happy to sit back and ride out the songs dense waves of sound, to prolong the euphoric feeling of anticipation-- the road trip hes soundtracking is very much his own, and hes as much a slave to the ambience as we are.",

        "article_text": "Halcyon Digest is a record about the joy of music discovery, the thrill of listening for the first time to a potential future favorite, and that sense of boundless possibility when youre still innocent of indie-mainstream politics and your personal canon is far from set. In revisiting that youthful enthusiasm, Deerhunter brilliantly rekindle it, and the result meets Microcastle/Weird Era (Cont.) as the bands most exhilarating work to date. Whether those halcyon days were real or just idealized doesnt matter. With producer Ben Allen, who lent a bass-heavy sheen to Animal Collectives Merriweather Post Pavilion, these four guys-- lead singer Bradford Cox, singer/guitarist Lockett Pundt, bass player Josh Fauver, and drummer Moses Archuleta-- have created a seamless album of startling emotional clarity.\nDeerhunter have never lacked ambition. 2007 breakout Cryptograms came as two discrete halves: one front-loaded with ambient drifts and clanging post-punk aggression, the other blasting off into sunny psych-pop. Microcastle turned out to be a sprawling, ghostly amusement park of a double album, with violence and frail beauty never far from each other. And then there are all those EPs, side projects, and rarities. In blog posts and interviews, Cox has shown himself to be a music lover of the highest order, almost a platonic ideal of the artist as fan.\nThis record marks a distinctly different approach for the band, more streamlined and stripped down, and in its sparest moments, it echoes the stark intimacy and one-take effortlessness of records like Neil Youngs Tonights the Night or Chris Bells I Am the Cosmos. Fans of the bands earlier stuff may understandably miss some of the old electric-guitar squall, but Halcyon Digests expanded instrumental palette-- acoustic guitar, electronic percussion, banjo, autoharp, harmonica, vocal harmonies, and saxophone (!)-- creates endless depths of intricacy and nuance to explore in headphones.\nIn the past, Deerhunters gift for garbled sonics and Coxs stream-of-consciousness methods made it easy to downplay the groups lyrical ability. Thats not the case here. Whether by Pundt, who sings lead on two of Halcyon Digests best songs, or Cox, Deerhunters songwriting congeals into a style all its own, with lyrics moved front-and-center. The words fit perfectly together, down to the most trivial minutia: Cox asking, \"Did you stick with me?\" at the start of garage-pop fist-pumper \"Memory Boy\", right after the track people are most likely to skip (funny!), or Pundt mentioning a \"marching band\" on another uptempo proto-anthem, \"Fountain Stairs\", as Bill Oglesbys sax first appears.\nThe topical ground covered here is inspired, too: \"Revival\", a sort of Southern gothic folk-rock baptism, embraces religion. \"Im saved, Im saved!\" Cox exalts, \"I felt his presence heal me.\" Recorded to four-track, \"Basement Scene\" \"dream[s] a little dream\" that soon turns nightmarish: \"I dont wanna get old\" quickly becomes \"I wanna get old\" as Cox weighs the alternative. And first single \"Helicopter\" is a beautifully watery electro-acoustic farewell that uses a tragic Dennis Cooper story about a Russian prostitute (graciously reprinted in the liner notes) to support its emotional bleakness.\nThen theres seven-and-a-half-minute finale \"He Would Have Laughed\", dedicated to Jay Reatard, the Memphis garage rocker who died last winter of drug-related causes at age 29. Its lyrics are the most cryptic on Halcyon Digest-- full sentences are rarely formed before Cox closes them off with his usual crisp consonants. A simple acoustic guitar riff repeats as other percussion elements and electronic tones pan across the track, occasionally joined by the full band. Cox admits to growing \"bored as I get older,\" and then goes into a dream-- \"I lived on a farm, yeah/ I never lived on a farm\"-- until he finally all but asks, \"Where are your friends tonight?\" The track cuts off unexpectedly mid-note.\nDeerhunter unveiled their new album by asking fans to print out a vintage DIY-style poster, photocopy it, and tape it up all over town. In the last couple of weeks, band members have participated in all-night online chats with some of their most devoted fans. Well never be able to parse every lyric or tease out every technical intricacy-- though somebody will probably try-- but that is what Halcyon Digest is all about: nostalgia not for an era, not for antiquated technology, but for a feeling of excitement, of connection, of that dumb obsession that makes life worth living no matter how horrible it gets. And then sharing that feeling with somebody else wholl start the cycle all over again.",

        "article_text": "George Lewis, Jr.s self-described bizarre and lonely childhood forms the backdrop for his work as Twin Shadow, and he uses the sounds of the past as a foundation. But while the 26-year-old Brooklynites music is steeped in 1980s new wave-- he sometimes takes on Morrisseys vocal tone and phrasing, and threads of British bands like Echo and the Bunnymen and Depeche Mode run through his songs-- Lewis does well by this much-revisited era. Simplicity is part of what carries it over. On Forget, his debut full-length, he mostly sticks with a small collection of synth sounds-- strings, organ, piano, and brass-- along with electric guitar and drum machine. The instruments are clean, shimmery, and carefully placed. With Grizzly Bears Chris Taylor handling production, this limited palette proves to be more than enough to work with, and each song is immediately distinguishable from the others. Lewis execution is immaculate, and he manages to make these familiar sounds into something that sounds refreshing and even dazzling.\nThe hotel-room production is ideally suited to the subject matter, matching the charged emotions of the lyrics. \"Yellow Balloon\" is full of vignettes from youth-- \"If you hear your mama calling/ Get away from me/ Secret handshakes/ The swimming hole\"-- and the icy atmosphere, along with a creepy piano line, suggests that these memories arent necessarily good ones. On another standout, \"Tether Beat\", a ghostlike synth ranges around in the lower registers as Lewis asks over and over, \"Does your heart still beat?\" Album highlight \"Castles in the Snow\" creates a metaphor from the imagery of the title, using sharp hi-hats, handclaps, piercing strings, and bird-like vocal calls to show that everything the narrator touches \"turns cold.\" Tracks like these create a mood that is nostalgic, regretful, and even sinister.\nRoughly half the album consists of these slower, dreamier turns; the other half is faster paced and thus better tailored to the live setting (or a high school dance). On these songs, Lewis tackles the same broad subject of love-- forbidden crushes, dance floor flirtations, serious relationships-- with the same overall aesthetic. But he abandons menace in favor of sweetness: the bass on \"Shooting Holes\" and \"When Were Dancing\" thumps out locomotive disco beats; pretty flutes and strings accent the excellent dance floor saga \"I Cant Wait\"; and the sparkling synths on closer \"Forget\" create a lulling slow dance for Lewis loaded refrain, \"Theyll give us so much to forget.\" Here, Lewis lyrics are more narrative and romantic, but theyre no less witty or poetic.\nTaken whole, Forget feels undeniably of the moment, fitting in nicely with the craftsmanship of 80s pop revivalists like the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Lewis labelmate Class Actress, and, to some degree, the xx. And like the best of this wave, the album also has a function beyond its danceable beats and electronic fireworks: It is sophisticated enough to withstand close, repeated listening. The songs may be catchy, but their intricacy and thoughtful storytelling makes them stick. And for its impressive sonic sheen, the albums skillful restraint makes it sound better with every spin. Instead of merely evoking an established style, Lewis songs feel honest and straightforward, so the new wave glances are a vehicle for the songwriting rather than the whole point.",

        "article_text": "Free jazz drummer Milford Graves has a nice trick that he performs at his shows: He brings someone in the audience up on stage and asks them to feel for his heart rate. It starts out steady, but as the person holds both wrists, it slows, and Graves begins to diverge his bloodstream on either side of his body, finally achieving an internal polyrhythmic pulse between the two points. Then he jumps behind his kit and clatters away in ecstasy.\nFour Tets lone member, Kieran Hebden, is fascinated with the impossible rhythms that the free-form jazz greats could bang out as they pleased. Whether or not hes taking a page out of Milford Graves book is debatable, but he opens \"Hands\" with a cardiac sample fibrillating into a multi-limbed percussive rattle of densely edited and seemingly random drum hit samples that just starts to stroke Barry Altschuls beard before locking down into a hip-hop groove. He fades the cymbals sizzles into the pseudo-Clyde Stubblefield sticks of \"She Moves She\", a cycling song evenly spaced with wheeling rimshots, scattered gongs, and funky string plucks that veer around the car horns that bleat past.\n\"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\" gently blows iron-lung sighs through ride cymbals and dirty, run-out grooves while an austere piano twinkles, hinting at the sort of gentle sounds Hebden will soon weave around English folk legend Vashti Bunyan. Verging on the lugubrious is the nine-minute \"Unspoken\" (whose piano riff is lifted from, of all sources, Tori Amos \"Winter\"), but Hebdens touch keeps it from morass. Here, he controls his ingredients-- fictitious soundbytes of early Gato Barbieri sax, a plaintive finger or two from McCoy Tyner, broken chimes, backwards feedback, and a DJ Shadow kickdrum-- keeping them at a contemplative simmer, rather than allowing them to come to a full boil.\n\"Chia\" is a tabla-bubbling conduit to the mod bass and shimmying sitar of \"As Serious as Your Life\", namechecking the crucial free-jazz text by Val Wilmer, yet standing much closer to Miles Davis On the Corner, with those odd-metered handclaps and that stuttering punch of a Jack DeJohnette hi-hat. With metallophone ripples at a wake, \"And They All Look Broken Hearted\" is an abstract and solemn affair, recalling the oddly melodic cadence of a player like Bobby Hutcherson, and with spliced drum solos swirling around some affected harpsichord and vibraphones like club smoke, Hebden captures the cool sadness of old Blue Note posters. It sounds like a shoo-in for the albums closing track, but it instead leads up to \"Slow Jam\", which has that long goodbye of the best melancholy closers, a circle game of echoing footsteps, fitful static, gleeful kazoos, lulling guitar repetitions, and shadows surely sinking in, revolving all disparate sounds to resolution.\nFreely moving in and out of cycles, able to coalesce or evanesce in a heartbeat, straight up and down, or else banging about like a toddler on the pot shelf, Rounds funnels every element through the drum, which always remains at the forefront of the mix. But what gives this record its internal order, and allows it to stand out against previous laptop explorations of immense record collections, is the other genres Hebden dabbles in and draws upon to flesh out the beat. Though hardly obvious the first time through, theres the supple, propulsive fun of funk, as well as the pastoral placidity of folk, both moving over the cut-up rhythms like cumulous clouds, allowing hot light through at some junctures, but cooling things out with a darker umbrage in others. Rounds may not be \"as serious as your life,\" as one track proclaims, but it does feel that pulse.",

        "article_text": "With the long-delayed, viciously imagined Hell Hath No Fury, Clipse-- hip-hops meanest, smartest duo-- have done what a gathering collection of internet seekers, record-store goers, and street corner mixtape shoppers hoped they might: release a classic. With musical partners the Neptunes, Clipse have crafted 12 unrelenting tales of desperation and distribution, glamour and gloating. Lyrically, the album is spare and incisive-- wordplay abounds but the punches are quick and devastating-- and musically, Malice and Pusha T have arguably snatched the best dozen Neptunes tracks in years. Together, the quartet has crafted an album thats sonically deep, dark, and one of 2006s finest.\nAn unforgivable mean streak powers this album, which is no surprise considering the endlessly documented label drama Clipse have endured, and the ascetic rage that courses through their music. Push and Mal spent much of their lauded 2005 mixtape, We Got It 4 Cheap Vol. 2, elucidating both their ethical and financial dealings: They were cold-blooded, joyous, and morally complex all at once. But the subject matter remained mostly street talk-- deals, slang, stunting-- with dabs of glitz tossed in. This album isnt about cocaine per se; its the aftershock of a coke sale-infused existence. The results spray everywhere, from the vacant spending spree of \"Dirty Money\" to the terrifyingly earned braggadocio of \"Trill\". This is lifestyle assertion, not something as negligible and confined as drug music.\nThe two men in the middle of it all are brilliant at nearly every turn. The younger Thornton brother, Pusha, remains star and stylist, brazenly dishing on minor details like his sunglasses (\"Louis V Millionaires to kill the glare\") while injecting a malevolent, almost maniacal intensity to his verses. His elder brother, Malice, is the vulnerable antecedent, not without floss but more leaning on family and fraternity: \"Grandma, look at me, Im turnin the other cheek,\" he laments on \"We Got It For Cheap (Intro)\". Their rhyme patterns arent overwhelmingly technical; Pusha rhymes straightforward syllables without tangling his syntax into a jumbled hush-mutter. (Jay-Z, take note: Sometimes directness is a blessing.)\nAnd, as if the sniping slow burn of lead single \"Mr. Me Too\" wasnt enough notice, Clipse are self-contained entities, seemingly uninfluenced by their contemporaries. Occasionally they recall duos of the past-- EPMDs playfulness, Outkasts willingness to attempt the unconventional, Mobb Deeps unerring rancor-- but theyre true only to their sound, a simmering executioners song. Rarely explicitly violent, their blistering conviction feels like carnage on \"What It Do (Wamp Wamp)\"-- Malice even compares himself to the genocidal Hutu tribe on the track. It confirms their unjustifiable relishing of moral decay, and while its impossible to comprehend or condone, the energy and flair is undeniable.\nAll that said, the Neptunes mystifying, irregular sonics further elevate the record. When the drum sounds are light and chimey, the surrounding melodies sound sinister and serpentine. Otherwise that formula is completely flipped, as doorknocker snares often accompany spacious arrangements. Its an interesting juxtaposition-- fitting the furious and odd against bubbly and blissful-- but this is what the Neptunes have always done best (think Noreagas \"Superthug\" or Kelis \"Milkshake\"). Accordions, steel pan drums, harps, distorted synths, cowbell-- Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo throw everything at Clipse. (One assumes Hugo, whose work has leaned toward the dark and spare in the past, had a large hand in this album.) \"Trill\" and \"Ride Around Shining\" in particular are monstrous, freakishly beautiful constructions. \"Trill\" surrounds you with its blown-out bass sound while the tense harp plucks of \"Ride\", posed against clipped groans and a single straining high note, are both fractured and gorgeous.\nBut whats perhaps most important here is that Hell Hath No Fury is uncompromising music: Delayed more than three years and pushed into some unclear anticipation vortex, Clipse still refused to make concessions. The one ballad, \"Nightmares\", featuring Bilal, is long and morose and ragged, while the frothiest ditty is about spending drug money on expensive shoes. Clipse make street music, so the more unlikely members of their fanbase-- hipsters, bloggers, students-- might seem perplexing. Of course, their wit and verve, always touched by a hint of self-loathing, connects with most anyone whos done any wrong in their life. Living with yourself can be a tricky thing, and for Clipse, thats now truer than ever.",

        "article_text": "Floating around the internet last fall before emerging on a 7\" in November, Fuck Buttons \"Bright Tomorrow\" proved surprisingly resilient. The duos blunt repetition of simple elements-- metronomic drum-machine, chugging synth, blissful keyboard, and distorted screams-- seems like a formula for tedium. But the song somehow gets stronger with each replay. For a noise group, Fuck Buttons are surprisingly welcoming-- for noise music, anyway-- and their mix of dreamy melody and abrasive climax evokes strange stylistic bedfellows: Yo La Tengo and Ministry, My Bloody Valentine and Prurient, Spacemen 3 and Black Dice.\n\"Bright Tomorrow\" wasnt the webs first glimpse of Fuck Buttons, or even of this album: Street Horrrsing was available for free from the bands website (under a since-forgotten alternate title) when Pitchfork first wrote about the duo in Forkcast more than a year ago. But with the record now seeing official release, anyone hoping for an LP-length version of \"Bright Tomorrow\" will not be disappointed. For 50 minutes spread across six tracks, Fuck Buttons craft hypnotic patterns with the same set of sonic tools (plus live-sounding drums, in tribal Boredoms-meets-Animal Collective mode). Long chords drift over oscillating tones and pounding beats. Simple figures build slowly into cresendos punctuated by fiery howls. Sounds and ideas repeat constantly, yet Street Horrrsing never feels redundant.\nThe key to how Fuck Buttons pull this off lies in their creative origins: Brits Andrew Hung and Benjamin John Power formed the group in 2004 with the goal of creating pain-inducing noise music, but soon became curious about mixing in prettier sounds, and adding structure and melody to their brutal tracks. Still, they never lost the aggression and abstraction of their noise leanings: Theyre not afraid to let a beat pound forever, or let a drone wash slowly, or let a pedal loop endlessly. Where more traditional groups might worry that a part goes on too long, Fuck Buttons seem fascinated by what will happen if it does, riding it just past the point of expectation before hitting you with the next big switch-up. Its a trick that gives Street Horrrsing a sense of constant tension, with another surprise detonation always looming around the corner.\nThe album begins with \"Sweet Love For Planet Earth\", whose sparkly synths and pulsing drone bring to mind Gang Gang Dances starry-eyed explorations. The patient power of that track courses through the rest of this seamless record. Its in the drum circles and chants of \"Ribs Out\", the chopping drift of \"Okay, Lets Talk About Magic\", and the blown-out metal vocals of \"Race You To My Bedroom/Spirit Rise\", which seem to make time melt away. Throughout, Fuck Buttons stick religiously to simple ideas, but mix them in surprising ways. When you expect a scream to burst forward, a synth figure slides in, or a bass rumbles up from the background. Still, the duos signature is devout repetition. And by the time the loops of album closer \"Colours Move\" finally dissolve, Street Horrrsing has become one big loop itself-- an unbroken sonic circle.",

        "article_text": "In early 2011 a song called \"Ungirthed\" by a group called Purity Ring started circulating online. There wasnt much information about them out there; they had a member that used to be in something called Gobble Gobble, which momentarily seemed notable. But everything you needed to know was contained in the song itself. It mixed the kind of ghostly pitch-shifted vocals, reminiscent of the Knife and Burial, that had spent the previous year haunting witch house; it had warped, surging, Dilla-derived synth chords that popular online remixers like Star Slinger were on the verge of turning into a cliché. And it had the stuttering start-stop drum machine patterns that highlighted how much the pulse of Southern rap had invaded indie music the last few years. But where these production touches were often held up as ends in themselves, \"Ungirthed\" was a well-constructed and fully realized pop song, with an infectious vocal hook and a melody that went places. This was novel. It was the kind of tune you took notice of immediately.\nEventually we learned that \"Ungirthed\" was the work of Megan James (vocals) and Corin Roddick (production), two young musicians from Edmonton, Alberta. Wisely, they didnt rush out an album, but other songs trickled out: \"Belispeak\" surfaced in the fall and \"Obedear\" emerged this spring. Along the way, Purity Ring polished up their live show, outfitting the stage with lanterns synchronized to the music, which Roddick triggered via MIDI using drumsticks. They built an audience with very little recorded music to share with it. And now, a year and a half later, theyve issued their debut album, Shrines.\nSince those early singles all mined such similar sounds, it was an open question how Purity Ring might mix things up over the course of an 11-song, 38-minute full-length. But Shrines is not about range, instead offering subtly different versions of a single, near-perfect idea. You might think of the album as a sculpture, and each track offers a different vantage point. \"Ungirthed\" is how you see it head on; \"Fineshrine\" is what it looks like from a low angle, with a bit of shadow from the overhang providing an extra touch of darkness; \"Crawlersout\", with its sharper percussive edges and extra portion of ghosted vocals, is the view from 90 degrees to the left; and then \"Grandloves\", with unwelcome guest vocals from Isaac Emmanuel of Young Magic, is like having a guy standing between you and the work, and he wont stop talking on his cell. \"Grandloves\" is the one moment in which Purity Ring seem common, but thats one truly weak song out of 11. Not a bad ratio for a new band. And the consistent quality makes it easy to forgive the feeling that occasionally creeps in the first few times you hear the album straight through: \"Didnt I just hear this one a couple of minutes ago?\" \nA quality that further elevates Shrines is the lyrics, and thats something that could be easily missed, since James vocals are often heavily processed. They, too, offer variations on a theme. \"Sea waters flowing from the middle of my thighs,\" are the first words we here on the opening track, \"Crawlersout\", and the focus on the body never lets up. From \"Dig holes in me with wooden carved trowels,\" on \"Grandloves\" to \"The crawling animals will seek all things warm all things moist, I will relentlessly shame myself,\" on \"Saltkin\", the words are impressionistic but always come back to sweat, skin, and bones. Fluids ooze in sympathy with the chords; hearts are given away by being ripped from ribcages. The lyrics are vivid and striking, even if it takes some work to parse them out. And the contrast between their bloody earthiness and music born of 1s and 0s gives the record an appealing push/pull and provides the album with some additional staying power. These songs, so instantly catchy, have more to offer over time. \nThe band that Purity Ring most reminds me of is High Places. The dubbed-out retro-futuristic approach to sound, the male/female duo, the connection to the earlier iterations of indie pop, the experiments with live spectacle. And High Places also emerged more or less fully formed, with the singles and EPs collected on 03/07 - 09/07 pulling together au courant influences into something that felt personal and new. But ever since, High Places have had some difficulty figuring out where to go next. Once you own a sound and make it your own, its not always easy to leave it behind. Well see how that plays out with Purity Ring. For now, the compulsively listenable Shrines stands quite well on its own. Most bands never manage a statement this forceful.",

        "article_text": "A few months ago, A$AP Rockys career seemed mired in purgatory. The 24-year-old Harlem rapper had a spectacular 2011, snagging a still-crazy $3 million deal with RCA based on early buzz and then silencing skeptics with his breakout LiveLoveA$AP mixtape. But throughout 2012, LongLiveA$AP repeatedly failed to materialize. It was slated for July 4th, then September 11th, October 31, and eventually, sometime in December. When the final pushback happened, into the dead zone just after the new year, it began to feel like RCA was attempting to quietly jettison their investment from the corporate hull.\nBut LongLiveA$AP delivers on and even exceeds the promise of LiveLoveA$AP. Like that mixtape, the album is a triumph of craft and curation, preserving Rockys immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound. A third of the record remains close in style to LiveLoveA$AP while most of the collaborations follow in the steps of last springs \"Goldie\", which stamped producer Hit-Boys signature Mini-Boss Musik with a screwed-up hook and gumball-spitting flow that marked it as unmistakably Rockys. Plenty of rap-industry heavies appear on LongLiveA$AP, and they mix well with Rockys younger comrades. More importantly, the French-braid gold-teeth kid named after Rakim never cedes the center. For someone often criticized for his lack of depth, A$AP Rocky keeps delivering in the face of skepticism.\nEven the most dubious ideas succeed on LongLiveA$AP. For example, A$AP Rockys team-up with Skrillex, \"Wild for the Night\", bombs your cortex with screaming lasers, stadium-sized reverb, and a reggae-derived organ lope, and the beat feels like being on the receiving end of a perfectly executed Tekken chain combo. It seems like it should be impossible to rap over, but Rocky’s sweat-free double-dutch is an easy fit. Santigold handles the chorus hook on “Hell”, one of two Clams Casino beats on the album, and it feels just as unforced.\nA$AP Rocky sounds natural in every setting; along with his command of rhythm and cadence, this is his greatest gift. Whether hes showing off double- and triple-time bounce in the T-Minus-produced \"PMW (All I Really Need)\" or dodging RZA-styled string chops on \"1 Train\" alongside a collision of hot rappers including Action Bronson, Big K.R.I.T., and Kendrick Lamar, Rocky sounds utterly at home. Even when he stomps through a queasy Odd Future-style battlefield on “Jodye”, he fully owns the mold. That kind of malleability is crucial to pop stardom, and make no mistake, pop stardom is what Rockys gunning for. His lyrics, a riot of lifestyle brands and other desirables, can feel like standing in front of a closet of prohibitively expensive designer goods: There isnt much to feel unless you consider \"like three million bucks\" a feeling. But besides the Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors, the Margielas with no laces, the Escada and Balenciaga and Audemars Piguet, theres a lot going on in Rockys head.\nLate-album track \"Suddenly\" bears a co-producing credit from \"Lord Flacko,\" aka Rocky himself. In it, a drumless vocal sample fights its way to the surface through layers of aquatic muffling, teasing a titanic beat-drop that keeps not arriving. The song is almost all intro: When the beat finally hits, it only lingers for a few bars before disappearing again. Over this master class in tension and release, Rocky summons childhood memories in calm, expansive strokes: \"Everybody have roaches, but our roaches aint respect us,\" he cracks, flashing a previously unseen storytelling flair: \"We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights/ And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds/ In one clip, left two down, thats four kids/ But one lived, left three dead but one split/ That one missed, that one snitched.\" The song is a forceful reminder of his birthplace and heritage.\nRocky’s New York story has partly been a story of how there is no coherent New York story anymore: Bay Area rappers like the Jacka convincingly channel the gray Queensbridge fatalism of Mobb Deep and Cormega while in Harlem, Rocky soaked up styles happening hundreds of miles away-- Houston screw music, UGK, Bone Thugs. But beneath the 90s-baby trappings, Rocky is a certain breed of Harlem rapper incarnate-- flashy, ambitious, and affably determined to cross over. The flamboyance and singsong rhyme patterns of the Diplomats are an obvious primary color. But reaching further back, to another Harlemite with a deceptively catchy flow, agreeable air, and penchant for colorful clothing, and you find another kindred spirit in Ma$e. Like Ma$e, Rocky tucks steely edges behind a goofy smile. He has the same unerring instinct for balancing pop smarts and street edge and a similar disregard for New York orthodoxy. He’s also consistently dismissed as a lightweight. Its true, Rocky may not be the answer to New York raps savior complex. But he is undeniably a hit-maker and a major new rap star for a city that sorely needs one. And with LongLiveA$AP, hes beaten expectations twice.",

        "article_text": "Before you play a note, your band begins as a series of decisions: Which bands inspire us? Who do we want to sound like? What are we going to call ourselves? These early triangulations often lead to everything else falling into place: bass lines, vocal affectations, guitar tones, production, album-art style. They say a lot about the band you intend to become. Sam France and Jonathan Rado, a duo from L.A., decided at some point that they would be called Foxygen. Yes, they were still in high school at the time. But when you pair that name with the unwieldy title We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic, you get a certain picture: goofily endearing, kid-brother types, the kind of guys who will probably embarrass you in public if you let them. Which makes the assured and witty We Are that much more surprising.\nFrance and Rado have been playing together for years, and theyve apparently spent that time working through their relationships to their record collections. Faced with the terrifying bounty of the rock menu on their 2012 EP Take The Kids Off Broadway, they seemingly shut their eyes and ordered everything at once: The songs stumbled through styles like there was a demented drill-sergeant producer in the background yelling, \"OK now, Memphis soul! Now, when I say, Merseybeat-era Beatles! GO!\"\nWe Are, by contrast, has more poise, rifling with effortless cool through retro-rock quotes and mannerisms-- Frances gulps and sobs draw directly from the Mick Jagger of \"Lets Spend the Night Together\" at one moment and channel the thousand-ton boredom of Lou Reed the next. Meandering organ pokes through on \"No Destruction\"; flecks of \"Under My Thumb\"-style guitars pop up on \"On Blue Mountain\". In the lovely \"San Francisco\", France paints the city as a place where \"the forest meets the bridge,\" and the grass scent of the Kinks We Are the Village Green Preservation Society wafts by (even their album title is an echo of that one). Having a great record collection and having some idea what to do with it are two different things, and on We Are The Ambassadors Foxygen have internalized enough of the music they love to start toying with it.\nAs you spend more time with We Are, you begin to notice some of that playfulness manifesting itself, like the pitched-down vocals counting in the opening of \"On Blue Mountain\", a song that rattles through multiple tempo and key changes without seeming disjointed. The warbly \"Oh Yeah\" cant seem to decide what kind of homage it is, veering between a yearning Captain Fantastic falsetto chorus, Blood Sweat \u0026 Tears symphonic soul, and an \"aww-yeah\" breakdown that is a near-direct quote of \"Mr. Big Stuff\". The echoes are blurred further by producer Richard Swift, a talented singer-songwriter with a meticulous ear for period detail. He follows the bands songwriting cues wherever they lead, and Ambassadors seems to be reporting from  three simultaneous decades of rock history.\nFrance, meanwhile, has become a sharp storyteller and lyricist, reeling off lines that feel like insults even if you cant parse them: \"I caught you sipping milkshakes in the parlor of the hotel,\" he yawns on \"No Destruction\", before delivering the piercingly direct (and already heavily quoted) stinger \"Theres no need to be an asshole, youre not in Brooklyn anymore.\" On \"Shuggie\", he sighs \"I met your daughter the other day, that was weird/ She had rhinoceros-shaped earrings in her ears,\" an arresting image that in context evokes an odd sense of sadness. The call-and-response chorus of \"San Francisco\"--  \"I left my love in San Francisco/ (Thats okay, I was born in L.A.)\"-- hits like a joke even if the target isnt clear.\nSlipped between the air quotes are proclamations that ring with personal truth: \"We can live on blue mountain like livin in a sunset/ We can live honestly and true,\" goes the chorus to \"On Blue Mountain\". On \"Shuggie\", France sings \"If you believe in yourself, you can free your soul.\" He sings it in a warbly, affected voice, pulling a face at the sentiment slightly, a trick he repeats at the albums coda, where he keens in an off-key choirboy voice: \"If you believe in love/ Everything you see is love/ So try to be what God wants you to be/ And say that I love you/ Again.\" Its one thing to give your band and your album a silly name, and to play dress-up with rock history while tweaking the formula. Its another thing entirely to mean it; the more time you spend with Ambassadors, the more clearly that commitment and joy comes through.  ",

        "article_text": "One of the prevailing critical talking points surrounding the release of Radioheads Kid A had to do with Thom Yorkes willful defilement of his own vocals. Remember the reactions? Those desperate for the band to remain in the golden-throated glory days of The Bends puzzled over the move before ultimately chalking it up to a function of Yorkes inscrutable eccentricity; others cited interviews in which Yorke professed to be sick of his own voice as proof there was a more sympathetic method to his madness. But despite all the peripheral talk about the bands blossoming love of electronic and experimental music, few critics advanced the simplest theory, which was that Radiohead had completely succumbed to its own lust for the textures of dance music. No wonder those vocals had to go.\nVocal-fronted acts in dance and electronic music have tangled for years with how to rectify the textural freshness afforded by synths, samplers, and computers with the relative milque-toastiness of the human voice. The disco/house solution has been to lubricate vocals with a glossy coating of filters and vocoders; electros has been to marry cold, bristly analogs with deadpan vocal affect; IDMs has been to chop, slice, and dice; and a number of general purpose dance acts have decided that multiplicity (by way of an endless procession of guest vocalists) is the key to staying energized. That said, only a handful of electronic full-lengths have navigated the vocal/textural divide as inventively as and refreshingly as Kid A. The latest is Silent Shout.\nThe brainchild of Swedish siblings Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer Andersson, the Knife have released three records, each an exponential improvement over the last. Although the last, 2004s Deep Cuts, boasted the shimmering \"Heartbeats\"-- a sort of \"99 Luftballons\" for the techno set, since covered by up-and-coming indie darling José Gonzalez-- it was also something of a mess, spitting up steel drum samples, happy hardcore breaks, and innocuous synthpop riffs. A much tighter, laser-guided record, Silent Shout finds the duo honing in on a specific mood, and at last, perfecting a signature sound. As evidenced by the Chris Cunningham-esque creature adorning the promotional material and artwork of the albums debut single, the operative adjective here is \"evil.\" Along with recent outings from Mu and Cristian Vogel, Silent Shout achieves a forbidding cold-bloodedness by melding contemporary electronic sounds with a grotesque vocal palette. Call it \"haunted house.\"\nAs menacing as it is hooky, this is some bracing stuff. It helps that Dreijers arrangements have become more assured and refined over time-- from the rushing percussion and synth flares of \"Neverland\" to the hall of plexiglass mirrors wonkiness of \"We Share Our Mothers Health\", he frequently finds a striking balance between minimalism and dissonance. But, as alluded above, Anderssons vocals do the bulk of the work. With \"Heartbeats\"-- not to mention her guest spot on Röyksopps slept-on \"What Else Is There\"-- she proved that her shrill voice (think Björk by way of Ari Up by way of Siouxsie Sioux by way of Mus Mutsumi Kanamori) was capable of magic in its natural form, but little of Silent Shout grants us that pleasure.\nHere, her vocals are almost always multi-tracked, with at least one of those tracks run through a pitch shifter or octave filter or something similar, usually to genuinely creepy result. On the records eponymous horrorshow opener, she sounds like shes duetting with Zuul; \"The Captain\" runs her vocal through an exciter and pitch-shifts it up to mimic the Oriental scale; \"Still Light\" has her singing feebly into a ceiling fan from a hospital bed; and \"One Hit\" is possibly the only song in the world that could be reasonably classed \"goblin glam\" (note: that means its great). An early contender for best record of the quarter, heres hoping Silent Shout inspires similar imagination and pushing outwards; after all, no matter how heady and interior electronic music allows itself to become, it could never get as scary as the world outside.\n ",

        "article_text": "Portland, Oregon natives the Thermals have been hovering on the periphery since their 2003 debut, delivering solid records to undersized acclaim. The bands third album, The Body, The Blood, The Machine, conjures an America piloted by some sort of Christian-fascist regime (\"Theyll pound you with the love of Jesus...Theyll own your days/ Theyre only Gods babies/ They follow, they know\"), and traces the frantic, fiery flight of an ex-pat and his girl (\"I can see shes afraid/ Thats why were escaping/ So we wont have to die, we wont have to deny/ Our dirty God, our dirty bodies\"). The Bodys story is just vague and gruesome enough to be weirdly terrifying, totally Orwellian, and grander, louder, and more electrifying than anything the Thermals have spit out before.\nOriginal drummer Jordan Hudson ditched the band in 2005, meaning that during the recording of this album guitarist/vocalist Hutch Harris and bassist Kathy Foster were twitching for three, bouncing around from instrument to instrument, filling in the gaps, injecting percussion, keyboards, organs, bass, and plenty of guitar into their lo-fi basement punk. Produced by Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty, The Body is appropriately reminiscent of the Thermals previous two full-lengths, but far more ambitious in narrative and sound-- the production is cleaner, Harris vocals are less prickly and more impassioned, and every slammed chord soars. Both in theory and execution, The Body, The Blood, The Machine hits like a less playful, less suburban American Idiot, its apocalyptic, heavily religious iconography conveniently layered over pounding, Ramones-style pop-punk.\nThe Bodys unrelenting lyrical gravity is also its single biggest strength-- this isnt the first time the Thermals have gotten political (on 2004s Fuckin A, Harris bleakly instructed us to \"Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination\"), but, from the opening organ chord of \"Heres Your Future\", its clear that this is the band at its most somber-- when Harris seethes \"So heres your future!\" a few beats after inciting \"the new master race,\" its impossible not to feel like you should transfer all the energy youd usually waste pogo-ing around your living room into scrawling letters to elected officials. \"Returning to the Fold\" employs a classic post-grunge melody, Harris big, punchy wails poking through his guitar-web like its 1994 and youre watching \"120 Minutes\" in your parents basement. \"St. Rosa and the Swallows\" is a thorny ode to escape (\"Passing the corners, we kissed in the rain/ Passing the old rusted warning signs/ What did they say?/ I think they said run!\"), while closing cut \"I Hold the Sound\" is spare and weirdly engrossing, the closest the band comes to recreating the impossible catchiness of \"No Culture Icons\", before bowing out in a haze of feedback.\nFosters drums and Harris weird vocal syntax (which contains echoes of the Mountain Goats John Darnielle) are nicely propulsive, and The Body, The Blood, The Machine cuts off before it runs the risk of getting too repetitive. But the results of its 38 minutes are still chilling. Harris imagined landscape is severe and grisly, leaving us all to sprint for cover, curling under desks, hands over heads, fingers crossed: These tracks land like bombs.",

        "article_text": "Saturdays=Youth-- the new album from French musician M83 (aka Anthony Gonzalez)-- opens with a stately piano phrase. Synths gradually overtake the piano and Gonzalez sings concise lyrics in falsetto-- \"Its your face/ Where are we?/ Save me\"-- amid billowing harmonies. Its the sort of big, beatless slow-burn he often uses to dramatize an impending pivot, a moment when the percussion gallops in and the song takes off for the stratosphere. But on this track, \"You, Appearing\", that pivot never arrives. Instead, the music tapers off into the booming overture of \"Kim \u0026 Jessie\".\nSaturdays=Youth is still huge music, with three players in addition to Gonzalez-- but it has a different kind of heft from previous M83 records. On Before the Dawn Heals Us, M83 was all about the vertical push-- layer after layer of synths and drums piled up in a vertiginous tower. But these new songs disperse in all directions: Producers Ewan Pearson and Ken Thomas spread the melodies and beats into a sound world of uncommon vibrancy and pristine clarity, mounted on a massive yet now more proportionate scale.\nNot only does the music move differently, it offers a different take on M83s favorite decade, the 1980s. Where previous albums saluted the doomed grandeur of the Cure and the retro-futurism of Blade Runner, Saturdays=Youth pays homage to Cocteau Twins (whom Thomas has also produced) and the teen dramas of filmmaker John Hughes. Its dense with new wave tropes: the chrome-plated guitars and aqueous keyboards on \"Kim \u0026 Jessie\", the decadent synthetic toms on the otherwise cloudy \"Skin of the Night\", the funk guitars and shivering cymbals of the masterful \"Couleurs\". Many modern bands have appropriated these iconic touchstones with a wink, a revision, or both. M83s reverent take is less common, bringing to mind Lansing-Dreidens underappreciated 80s throwback The Dividing Island.\nThe album has the same nostalgic sparkle as Hughes films, a soft-focused mythology of eternal summers and young love. In the liner notes, Gonzalez dedicates it to \"all the friends, music, movies, joints, and crazy teachers that made my teenage years so great!\" At 26, Gonzalez is just the right age to look back on this era with rose-tinted glasses, forgetting the alienation and anxiety, remembering only the sweetness. Whenever the darker side of teenhood rears its head, its heroically battled back: On the shoegaze-thick \"Dark Moves of Love\", \"everything is wrecked and grey,\" but the song ends on a poignant note: \"I will fight the time and bring you back!\" On the albums cover, heartbreakingly radiant youths (one of them a dead ringer for Molly Ringwald) strike poses in a gold and russet pasture-- the same kind of beautiful misfits that Hughes arranged in after-school detention. In lyrics filled with lusty eruptions (\"They are Gods! They are lightning!\"), archetypal teens invent themselves with innocent fervor: A love-struck young couple in \"Kim \u0026 Jessie\"; a goth with a crown of black roses and a heart of bubblegum in \"Graveyard Girl\".\nIn the context of teen drama, how perfect is it that Gonzalez met Morgan Kibby, whose dovelike vocals enrich \"Skin of the Night\" and \"Up!\", on MySpace? In the context of a band whose music is both literally and metaphorically cinematic, how perfect is it that Kibby has done voiceover work on the trailers for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and M. Night Shyamalans Lady in the Water? These symmetries make Saturdays=Youth feel like an unaccountably alive, complete album. While some fans might be disappointed by the lack of a \"Dont Save Us From the Flames\"-style anthem, the change in M83s sound arrives just as Gonzalez has pushed the maximal thing to its limits and risks diminishing returns. On its first two studio albums, M83 did one thing very, very well: create compact doses of tension and adrenaline. Saturdays=Youth meaningfully diversifies M83s catalog while retaining Gonzalezs indelible fingerprint. Like his recent ambient foray, Digital Shades Vol. 1, it finds a guy whos known for painting gigantic horizons figuring out how to broaden them even more.",

        "article_text": "Who couldve guessed that SNMNMNM were ahead of the curve? In 2009, you kind of need to know some C++ just to talk about bands. The trend began in dreamy California, which gave us the skuzzy-sweet Nodzzz and Wavves, and then migrated as far as Nebraska (UUVVWWZ) and Glasgow (Dananananaykroyd). Meanwhile, in serious Brooklyn, the Antlers were quietly working on a coincidental antithesis to this fad. Hospice answers silliness with solemnity, jitters with nerve. Their band name simply describes their music: a delicately branching instrument of force.\nNot that the Antlers are startlingly original-- theyre just swinging for the bleachers at a time when it seems fashionable to bunt, or put your forehead on the bat and spin until you get dizzy. Their widescreen sentimentality comes with an equally familiar back-story. You remember the Bon Iver beat: Sad, bearded dude emerges from self-imposed exile with batch of urgently intimate songs; recruits band; self-releases album that earns surprise web-buzz and gets picked up by venerable indie label. Well, the Antlers used to be the solo project of Peter Silberman, who wrote Hospice while emerging from a period of \"social isolation.\" During the bedroom recording process, two guest musicians (drummer Michael Lerner and multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicci) became permanent members. They self-released Hospice in March, and Frenchkiss picked it up after web- and NPR-praise helped sell out its first pressing.\nThe Antlers skyscraping blend of the ambient and the anthemic is a far cry from Bon Ivers subtle folksiness, but Silberman and Justin Vernon emerged from their traumas seeming equally scoured and eager to reconnect. Hospice is bereft of irony and cynicism, as befits a rather ghastly narrative that feels, perhaps deceptively, autobiographical. Centered around a relationship with a terminally ill child, and evocatively spun from eerie hospital scenery, snippets of conversations with doctors, terrifying dreams, and the periodic intrusions of Sylvia Plath, it becomes a broad meditation on guilt, duty, mortality, and hope in the face of hopelessness. The emotional payload, while artfully couched, is fervent and bleeding. Silbermans affecting earnestness, not to mention his sweet voice, allows him to pull off lines like, \"All the while I know were fucked/ And not getting un-fucked soon,\" while sounding more prayerful than cynical.\nGiven the bluster of the music and its fixation on death and illness (not to mention Silbermans creaky diction and fluttery falsetto), its impossible not to be reminded of Arcade Fires Funeral. You could even fix Hospices precedent a bit earlier-- its starry atmosphere and bludgeoning tenderness evoke Cursives Domestica with a pop-noise sheen. Like these groups, the Antlers plumb that elusive place where the personally specific becomes universal. They achieve this by keeping the human frailty of the singer intact while inflating his feelings to mythological proportions. You can imagine Silberman, in his isolation, growing world-sized and full; how the emotional forces he grappled with came to seem meteorological.\nThis sense of the boundary between self and world-at-large collapsing permeates Hospice. The lyrics cover shades of emotion from despairing persistence (\"Kettering\") to desperate joy (the 21st-birthday fantasia \"Bear\"); the music tells the same story, through quicksilver currents of tension and tranquility. \"Sylvia\" alternates between acute frailty and Queen-caliber bravado, guided by the sort of gnarled electronic line the Antlers love (see also the monotonous buzz whipping around the corners of chipper guitar chords on \"Two\"). But what’s really great is how these modulations of weight are integrated into an album-long sweep, with crescendos nested inside decrescendos, coiling surges inside lengthy unwinding passages. Its as vast and empathetic as loneliness itself, a generous framework through which Silberman can show us almost everything: The tiny figure on the horizon and his huge shadow on the mountain, the extreme weathers roiling about him at once symbolic and real.",

        "article_text": "No one likes Sage Francis. At least thats how it seems sometimes. After winning a Scribble Jam championship and releasing a series of incredible tour-only CDs, he was given the dubious honor of being recognized as an \"Internet superstar.\" 2002 saw the release of his Personal Journals on Anticons eponymous imprint, and while its emotional poignancy tapped a new vein in the hip-hop canon, valuing vulnerability over machismo façades, its detractors were brutal in their dismissal of its lyrics and style. Now hes teamed up with longtime producer Joe Beats to develop Hope, and if the album isnt a direct response to anyone who ever dubbed him \"emo,\" its proof he can play as hard in either arena.\nHope shows a new Francis altogether, employing bouncy cadences, explosive deliveries and complex rhyme schemes. The vast majority of the album references older hip-hop, including that of OC, Black Sheep, Beastie Boys, Audio Two, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, among others. He even drops his own crit with lines like \"faker than Raekwons stutter\" and \"Das EFX rocked that band-aid ten years before Nelly did!\" His writing focuses on lighter subjects here, from his disdain for rambunctious children (\"Disasters\") to his views on commercial music (\"Mainstream 307\") to his eccentric nature regarding different facets of existence (\"Spaceman\"), which all makes for a solid record that, in terms of both diversity and delivery, puts Personal Journals to shame.\nThe biggest testament to the looser nature of this album compared to his last is the inclusion of a fully developed song by his most popular alter ego. Riding a bass-heavy doorknocker with a foreign vocal sample, \"Xaul Zans Heart\" is one of Sages funniest performances to date, as he plays the role of a misogynist pseudo-pimp that claims to be \"deeper than Sage Francis,\" \"the life of the search party,\" and a \"fairy godmotherfucker,\" closing the song with the rousing line, \"I am womanizer, hear me whore.\" If youve doubted Francis could be capable of diversifying, this track should change your mind.\nOf course, Sage is still fully capable of the emotional style he built his name on. Rapping over a swaying ambient track with lone trumpet salvos and subtle synths, \"The Cure\" closes the album with a tour-de-force, placing him in line as one of the best writers in hip-hop today: \"Youre not the travelling type?/ Then hide your baggage better,\" he tells a significant other, while the repetition of, \"When a boy writes off the world, its done with sloppy, misspelled words/ If a girl writes off the world, its done in cursive,\" stands as a powerful reminder to the inherent beauty of womankind. Paired with a sharp rhyme scheme (\"Now I look for air pockets to pick, walk with a stick/ Start picking locks with it, opening up heart-shaped lockets with little arguments/ Tawdry trinkets start to split and contradict/ Those who say one thing but think the opposite\") and a ridiculously tight flow, it stands as one of the years most delicately and intricately written songs.\nFor a producer with such a low profile, Joe Beats makes an explosive splash in his first full-length effort. His chemistry with Sage Francis is apparent throughout the album, as their interplay is something many producer/emcee teams could benefit from further exploring. Beats use of beautifully raw drum programming hits like a more accessible Jel, and his mid-90s sampling style hearkens back to Pete Rock and Prince Paul, or the low-end proficiency of a young Ali Shaheed Mohammed. From the floating, atmospheric keyboard of \"Spaceman\" to the triumphant horn-led acoustic guitar crisscross \"Tolerance Level\", Joe Beats easily manages to bridge the gap between forward thinking and traditionalism.\nWith Hope, Sage Francis and Joe Beats set out with an ambitious and impressive goal-- to create the ultimate 1994 record in 2003-- and theyve succeeded admirably, paying tribute to the past while updating it for the future. A highly valued reminder of the need for traditionalism in modern music, this album stands strong as one of the years finest.",

        "article_text": "Inside the booklet included with Panda Bear's third solo album, Person Pitch, is a list of artists. The first four named are microhouse artists Basic Channel, Luomo, Dettinger, and Wolfgang Voigt. Maybe Noah Lennox, the man behind the Panda Bear, began this influence-naming exercise in a minimal techno state of mind. On the other hand, the inclusion of these four at the top could be significant. We always knew that the guys from his main band, Animal Collective, had an ear out for electronic music, but with Panda Bear, the impact of the DJ seems to run deeper. The music on Person Pitch sounds nothing like proper dance music, but the basic structure-- the use of dynamics, and above all, the sense of repetition-- draws heavily from that context. Which is particularly interesting considering what else is going on. The Beach Boys always come up when talking about Panda Bear, and not just because he shares their fondness for certain melodic turns: When he allows the reverb to blanch his voice, Lennox can sound uncannily like Brian Wilson. This tunefulness gives Person Pitch an appeal that extends beyond just Animal Collective fans, but the way the songs are put together also gives them an unusual twist. Producers in Brian Wilson's era never worked like this, sampling old songs and instruments and spinning them in wheels of sound that seem like they could go forever. Most of this record consists of intricately constructed, heavily layered, and highly repetitive loops on top of which Lennox sings oddly familiar and touching melodies. But despite its grounding in guitar pop, Person Pitch isn't likely to be mistaken for the work of a band. It sounds like what it is: one guy alone in his bedroom trolling through music history, picking and choosing bits to make something deeply personal and all his own. The repetition of the music here, though probably engendered by computer, has a strange analog quality. You can almost see the turntables rotating on the opening \"Comfy in Nautica\", which loops Lennox's sung \"ah\"'s and handclaps to evoke ritual campfire music, while the deep reverb on his voice puts us in the same liturgical headspace found on his very different acoustic record Young Prayer from 2004. \"Take Pills\" repeats a tambourine and twangy guitar during its slower opening section while industrial samples that sound like car parts being followed down an assembly line fill in the vast spaces. The field recordings take an aquatic turn on the track's second half, as Lennox picks up his acoustic guitar and moves the party to the beach, singing \"I don't want for us to take pills anymore\" to the kind of effortlessly melodic line that once expressed thoughts like \"da doo ron ron.\" Given the presence of such tremendously catchy pop moments on Person Pitch, the record's indulgences feel completely earned. The flurry of tabla that opens the extended \"Good Girl/Carrots\" sticks out at first but makes sense once Lennox gets the hectic dub chaos out of his system and settles into the second section's hypnotic tune. When the song edges become wispy and shapeless on \"I'm Not\", which blends Lennox's voice with an indistinct droning synth, the mood and thrust of the album gives the track the appropriate context. \"Search for Delicious\", reminiscent of the glowing ambient drift of Lennox's side project Jane, won't leave the drone alone, repeatedly knocking Lennox's singing off track like a clumsy but well-meaning drunk. Music of such warped processing would be a specialist's item, but as a breather here, before the simple and childlike music-box closer \"Ponytail\", it feels right. I still haven't talked about the 12-and-a-half-minute \"Bros\", the astonishing track that serves as the album's centerpiece. It's here that Person Pitch's repetition and DJ's sense of timing are most apparent, while Lennox's songwriting hits a melodic peak. The first few bars turn to the golden age of 60s and 70s radio, with some rattling percussion chipped from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and a chiming acoustic guitar that could be pulled from the Beach Boys' \"Girl Don't Tell Me\". But as the loops pass on \"Bros\", the song begins to seem like a glorious travelogue, a journey along a path where all the music's influences are visible along the roadside: the Wilson Brothers in their pinstripe shirts, or the queasy phasing and random sound effects-- a subway, people on a roller coaster, a baby crying-- of Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. When Panda begins to chant halfway through, we hear an echo of his main band, and when the neo-Latin piano comes in during the latter portion, transforming the track from internally-focused meditation to outwardly-beaming celebration, we get an image of Derrick May's classic techno anthem \"Strings of Life\" busting into a DJ set to make everyone go crazy. Person Pitch as a whole-- and \"Bros\" in particular-- evokes the sunshine of Lennox's adopted Lisbon, Portugal home. But it's the kind of light best experienced with eyes closed-- with the rays filtered through eyelids, turning the world into various shades of red and orange. You can feel the warmth pouring out of the music and see abstractions of its inspirations-- that whole long list and more-- as they cycle around again and again and again. Five of these seven songs have been released in various forms on singles and 12\"s previously, so the exceptionally high quality of this music isn't a surprise to those who have been following Panda Bear closely. Still, hearing it all together in one place and listening to it all at one time is both overwhelming and inspirational.",

        "article_text": "Has it really been fifteen months since I came across The Books? I remember clearly the first time I listened to Thought for Food. I was sitting on the sidewalk in front of my local laundromat, two loads in the washers, enjoying the shade underneath the green awning that hangs over the glass fa�_ade. Tucked into my shoulder bag I had a clutch of promo CDs that I dug out of my mailbox on the way over. My usual routine is to click through a track or two of each to get a sense of which records I want to listen to completely. After breezing through and discarding several records I've now forgotten, I snapped Thought for Food into the discman and listened straight through. It was different-- that was clear right away-- but it was an easy listen. I put down whatever I was reading, settled into my plastic patio chair, and squinted through the sunlight at the Greek restaurant across the street, concentrating on what was coming through my headphones: the familiar sound of guitar and violin cut up and mixed with vocal samples. Thought for Food was easy to love but I realized that I'd have trouble describing what made it interesting. It was too simple, too subtle; there was too much space. Now comes The Lemon of Pink. Having listened to The Books' debut god knows how many times since last summer and thoroughly absorbed its sound, the element of surprise has gone. In fact, the first time I heard the six-minute title suite that opens this album it seemed eerily familiar. In the first minute there's a repeating two-chord piano riff sourced from scratchy vinyl, a banjo, a collage of violin fragments, and a sample of a heavily accented woman intoning the nonsense phrase that gives the record its name. But then comes a surprise: naked, unprocessed vocals by a woman named Anne Doerner, far too modern sounding to be pulled from an old record. Indeed, the most apparent difference between The Lemon of Pink and Thought for Food is this record's greater use of original vocals. The Books obviously have a lot of old records lying around, so it makes sense to insert a bit of structure into their finely wrought collages. Some of the vocals find their way into tracks that are essentially proper songs, others are cut and pasted into glitched-up melodic configurations. Doerner's contribution to the title track is one of the best examples of the former. Her cracked, bluesy purr fits well with The Books' solid American roots core, and the melody is spare and understated, wisely remaining one of many elements rather than becoming the prime focus of the song. There's so much breathing room here, and her voice fills it perfectly. Books co-founder Nick Zammuto sings on several of the other tracks that play with song structure. \"Don't Even Sing About It\" is unusually dark and downcast, almost like an old Will Oldham dirge given The Books treatment, with unpredictable vocal samples cutting through the marching guitar plucking. \"Get used to hanging if you hang long enough\" is the sum total of the original lyrics, but it's the sort of cryptic splinter that suits this essentially fragmented music. \"The Future, Wouldn't That Be Nice?\" begins in typical Books fashion, with quick surges of crowd noise, vibraphone, guitar and bits of violin, but then the voice comes in, a flat sing-speak intoning Isaac Brockisms like \"the mind has a mind of its own.\" I'm a little iffy on these two; where Thought for Food's \"All Our Base Are Belong to Them\" was weird and otherworldly, these vocal tracks fit neatly into the experimental indie rock landscape. Both are solid, but somehow the presence of this voice makes The Books sound just a little less special. Contrast these more song-oriented bits with the sampled voice (I think it's Doerner's again) run through the shredder on \"There Is No There\". The various instruments and samples fold in and then start to swirl into an aural kaleidoscope, and then the vocals flutter past, too quick and broken for rational comprehension but emotionally clear as glass. You don't know what they're saying, but the feeling is immediate and intense. The power of \"There Is No There\" makes me think that at this point The Books still work best as collage artists, assembling odds and ends into new and affecting compositions. The Lemon of Pink makes for an interesting contrast with Thought for Food, in part because the two records have so much in common. Several of this record's tracks that closely follow the Thought for Food template are even better than their forbears, with more dynamic range and a greater sense of development. The way the sample of a flight attendant from a Japanese airline forms the centerpiece of \"Tokyo\" is absolutely perfect, matching the editing brilliance of Thought for Food's \"Aleatoric\", and \"Take Time\" is one of the more epic 3\\xBD-minute instrumentals you'll come across, building from quiet, simple samples into a joyous cluster of words and acoustic sound. The Lemon of Pink may sound a bit like this duo's debut, but it also sounds like nobody else. The Books remain more or less a genre of one.",

        "article_text": "Reality television, actors-turned-governors, and wrestlers-turned-rappers aside, its hard to think of many things that elicit cynicism and offhand dismissal like a sophomore album on the heels of a hyped debut. The dreaded \"sophomore slump\" is hardly a fictional pitfall fabricated by bitter music journalists and defensive cred-mongers; the pressures of turning out a second record can be crippling for bands whove encountered early success, and it often results in an album that pales in contrast to its predecessor. Yet, for every band that falters in the wake of initial success, theres another that puts their newfound experience to work for them, producing a second record-- a sophomore hump, if you will-- that delivers upon all the promise of their first. And with Chutes Too Narrow, the second album from much-lauded Pacific Northwest popsters The Shins, that sophomore hump is in full effect.\nArriving on a wave of pre-release hype in 2001, The Shins debut record, Oh! Inverted World, immediately established itself as one of the most uniformly and universally likeable records of that year. Though not nearly the second coming of The Beach Boys as described by its most vocal proponents, the album was forged in melody and drenched in atmosphere, casting a thin but palpable haze over a beautifully arranged landscape of sincere hooks and sparse instrumentation. It was an immediately inviting formula, if one that ultimately proved limiting; the blurred sonics that blanketed the record also often smothered it, dulling the focus and clarity that frontman James Mercer skirted during the albums most powerful passages.\nOn Chutes Too Narrow, the blanket has been lifted, and the complexity and grace revealed underneath possess a surprisingly depth. Every instrument is allowed to exist in its own space, no longer smoothed together by excessive reverb. Mercers voice resides comfortably at the front of the mix, revealing previously undiscovered layers of emotional subtlety and expressiveness. Every sound and syllable is perfectly and distinctly articulated, granting the album a much greater capacity for detail and profundity.\nAnd then there are the songs. Dear god, the songs! The uniqueness and inventiveness of James Mercers melodic sensibility simply cannot be overstated. On Chutes Too Narrow, as with its predecessor, Mercer makes brilliant use of his formidable vocal range, writing soaring melodies every bit as original as they are memorable. \"Saint Simon\", one of two or three songs on the record that could easily contend for song of the year, sees Mercer exploring an almost Bacharach-ian level of melodic sophistication. The track is host to an elegance of exposition and development not even hinted at on Oh! Inverted World, as it seamlessly segues from a straightforward pop hook to an ungodly gorgeous choral segment, replete with lush strings and chiming guitars. By the time Mercer reenters with a perfectly aching vocal melody, its almost unbearable-- this is the kind of song that overwhelms simply with the intricacy of its beauty.\nThe evolution of Mercers songwriting extends wonderfully into the louder songs on Chutes Too Narrow, as well. \"Kissing the Lipless\", the albums leadoff track, blissfully transgresses the restraint of Oh! Inverted World, building to an impossibly powerful chorus that slyly mirrors the melody of its verses. Indeed, while many pop songwriters seem to use verses simply as something to kill time between anthemic choruses, Mercer manages to squeeze some of the albums most memorable moments into places most songwriters would neglect or ignore. \"So Says I\", the albums first single, excels largely through the subtle variations worked into its verses, and enjoys its strongest moment in the transcendent harmonies that adorn a brief, seamless bridge.\nThe attention to detail on Chutes Too Narrow is truly impressive, but the way that these details combine to form music so effortless and emotionally rich is astounding. Chutes Too Narrow is host to enough perfect moments to carry ten records, each one arising spontaneously from the multifaceted frame of a masterfully constructed song. The album may alienate some listeners by eschewing the instant and consistent gratification of Oh! Inverted World for more involved, developed songs, but the clarity and intricacy of these songs renders the record a much more rewarding listen. Not simply an excellent album, Chutes Too Narrow is also a powerful testament to pop musics capacity for depth, beauty and expressiveness.",

        "article_text": "You are slowly being destroyed. Its imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though youll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.\nIts not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinskis Disintegration Loops are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, Basinski set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops hed had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinskis old music.\nThe process may be the hook for this sprawling four-disc set, but the loops themselves are stunning, ethereal studies in sound so fluid that the listener scarcely registers the fact that its nothing but many hundreds of repetitions of a brief, simple loop that theyre hearing. I imagine that life within the womb might sound something akin to these slowly swelling, beauteous snatches of orchestral majesty and memory-haze synthesizer. The pieces are uniformly consonant, embellished with distant whalesong arpeggios and echoing percussion.\nIn essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of process music Ive ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic. A piece may begin bold, a striking, slow-motion slur of ecstatic drone, and in the first minute, you will notice no change. But as the tape winds on over the capstans, fragments are lost or dulled, and the music becomes a ghost of itself, tiny gasps of full-bodied chords groaning to life amid pits of near-silence. Some decay more quickly and violently than others, surviving barely 15 minutes before being subsumed by silence and warping, while the longest endures for well over an hour, fading into a far-off, barely perceptible glow.\nThere is another, eerier chapter to the story of the Disintegration Loops-- that Basinski was listening to the playbacks of his transfers as the attacks of September 11th unfolded, and that they became a sort of soundtrack to the horror that he and his friends witnessed from his rooftop in New York that day, a poignant theme for the cataclysmic editing of one of the worlds most recognizable skylines. Removed from the context of that disaster and transposed into the mundane world we live in every day, The Disintegration Loops still wield an uncanny, affirming power. Its the kind of music that makes you believe there is a Heaven, and that this is what it must sound like.",

        "article_text": "In the commercial rap arena, few prospects are riskier than making the transition from a conventional sound to more avant-garde leanings. It can either bring you critical acclaim and general acceptance from the populace (Andre 3000) or it can alienate your original fanbase without appealing to the new audience whose eye youd hoped to capture (Common). Cee-Los latest record, however, treads the line perfectly, allowing him to play by his own terms, while maintaining the kind of strong hooks, production, and songs that pretty much anyone can get into.\nHis solo debut, 2002s Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections, was solid but ultimately forgettable and singularly toned. But Green seems to have focused on cohesion this time out, as this new collection of songs tie together nicely, despite the records diverse melting pot of spoken word, R\u0026B;, rap and gospel. Those expecting the pensive introspection and homemade synth-hop of his debut should look elsewhere, as this record draws on his greatest strength: the excitable rhyme flow that initially made him stand out from the rest of the Goodie Mob.\nCee-Los most interesting aspect is his adaptable persona: The way he shifts from an apologetic former gun-toting drug dealer to a discotheque lover man to a church preacher gives this album a ridiculous depth of replay. And lyrically, he dominates much like he did on the Outkast side project Dungeon Familys Even in Darkness, spitting battle salvos (\"Ive been running since Rock Box/ Ive cocked glocks and locked blocks/ And rocked rocks in drop-tops\") and street knowledge (\"When it hit ya, it usually hits somebody with ya/ Make em risk a total eclipse of the sun to get richer\") with the confidence of a man on a mission.\nHis mission statement is \"The Art of Noise\". Produced by The Neptunes with background vocals from Pharrell, the track is equal parts In Search Of... snares, and the piano part from Jay-Zs \"Allure\", making for a minimalist exercise that burrows into your skull with its emphatic chorus. Cee-Lo sounds as excited to have this beat as we are to hear him over it-- and he doesnt disappoint. Employing his half-singing/half-rapping cadence, he draws attention instantly, asking the listener to \"Have mercy, if I seem to be heavy/ I dont mean to be heavy,\" as if asking for acceptance regardless of his many distinguished quirks. Needless to say, in a post-\"Hey Ya\" environment, a song like this could easily make a giant dent in the singles chart.\nThe playgrounds that this \"five-foot-six-inch god\" inhabits, for the first time, match his obvious technical proficiency, maintaining a general tone of futuristic chops and bombastic horns throughout the record that recall Lyrics Borns monster debut Later That Day. Standouts include the Organized Noise-produced stuttering chopped toy piano and xylophone on \"Childz Play\", the shockingly original DJ Premier production of finger snaps and subtle cop-show sax on \"Evening News\", and the Roswell synth whistle, exploding black-college horn line and \"We Will Rock You\" stomp of \"Scrap Metal\". The only drawbacks are the occasional disco and 80s R\u0026B-inspired; cuts, as they fail to completely fit in context with the other beats.\nCee-Lo doesnt come out completely unscathed himself: At 18 tracks, theres a bit too much music here, and some tracks, like the occasional spoken word-style pieces, prevent the record from being the opus Cee-Lo is clearly capable of making. But even with these minor faults, a happy medium is achieved-- especially given that the record contains only two skits (the \"Intro\" and \"Outro\", both roughly 20 seconds long). Which leaves us with a strong experimental record that draws on Cee-Los malleable style of rap, staying deeply grounded in the Southern traditions that started his career even while he pushes the boundaries of convention, making for one of the years strongest hip-hop albums to date.",

        "article_text": "From the time of his first single in 2005 until he revealed his identity in August 2008, Burial maintained a carefully cultivated anonymity, arguably inventing the idea of the unknown but well-branded producer in the age of too much information. After the release of the landmark Untrue in 2007, Burial went quiet for almost two years. There was a lot of talk then about where his music might go next, about whether there was anywhere left for it to go. Its become a familiar problem in electronic music: when you create and own a sound completely, how do you continue to grow? Does growth matter? Until his first 12\" collaboration with Four Tet in 2009, it seemed like the man born William Bevan might just avoid addressing the question at all. The steady series of collaborative and solo 12\"s hes released since are an inspiring example of how to re-draw the borders of ones aesthetic. Hes still Burial, and he still owns this sound, but hes slowly and surely expanding the idea of what Burial means.\nBevan has accomplished this, in part, through his creative use of the 12\" format. If Untrue was an album that sometimes felt like a single masterful song, Burials best work since consists of long tracks that feel like miniature albums. \"Truant\", the A-side of his latest 12\", is nearly 12 minutes long and unfolds in distinct sections that, taken together, form a riveting narrative. The track immediately establishes itself as prototypical Burial: It moves from a brief opening drone to the familiar clattering snare; the crackles, the mournful synths, and the brief vocal sample are all there. Then, the idea of \"prototypical Burial\" is taken on a journey. Four minutes in, the tempo and rhythm shifts completely, the vocals change, and the mood moves away from bleary contemplation towards sharp-edged anxiety. When garbled orchestral samples enter in the final third, Burial is exploring completely new territory with fanfare-like music that feels almost celebratory. This is not the stuff of empty 5 a.m. streets, the echoing sense of comedown and loss. The music feels deep and wide and grand, and yet it still sounds like no one else. \"Truant\" is the Burial track as wide-ranging suite, and the progression from Untrues \"Archangel\" to here is staggering.\nThe B-side, \"Rough Sleeper\", covers just as much territory. Shifting into an up-tempo beat, the track folds in organ chords, pitch-shifted vocals, and, ultimately, a repeating music-box refrain that sounds like a bummed-out and broken version of a Latin-inflected piano refrain from a house track. The word \"soulful\" means different things to different people, but this earns that designation; theres a touch of gospel warmth to it, something that feels even optimistic. Usually, when Burial samples a voice saying something like, \"Theres a light surrounding you,\" it sounds like a dying memory. Here, it sounds like an acknowledgement of the glory of the here-and now. \"Rough Sleeper\"s emotional world is quite different from that of \"Truant\"; where the latter feels deep and wide, it oozes intimacy.\nTruant/Rough Sleeper doesnt have the intensity of last years Kindred EP, and it leans closer to the classic Burial sound, but its subtlety is its own reward. Who knows if or when a full-length follow-up to Untrue will arrive, but as long as Bevan continues to release smaller missives of this quality, it hardly matters. Taken together, this 12\" and the Kindred EP are roughly the same length as Untrue; the form and content are in perfect sync.",

        "article_text": "Listening to music by Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson reminds me of optical illusions, those little diagrams where you cant believe this line is really the same length as that line, or youre amazed that the swirling circle isnt really rotating. Our brains are complex computers but it doesnt take much to short the circuits. Were constantly constructing patterns based on context.\nVirðulegu forsetar is a long piece in four parts that depends heavily on juxtaposition. Over the course of an hour it continues to repeat a single phrase on trumpets, french horns, and tubas. Though simple, its a bold little cluster of notes with an inherent grandeur, and the brassiest voicing early in the piece suggests a fanfare before a great announcement. But Jóhannsson invests the refrain with a host of different meanings by slowing it down, shifting the pitch, putting it beside all sorts of interesting drones, and making it disappear completely for minutes on end. Over its length the piece undergoes remarkable shifts in mood and feel, which is even more notable considering the basic instrumentation (in addition to the brass, its scored for organs, piano, bass, glockenspiel, and subtle electronics) is the same throughout.\nSo Virðulegu forsetar is about minimalism and repetition, obviously, but its also one of the most patient records Ive heard. Where last years equally great Englabörn album consisted of chamber pieces at pop-song length, Virðulegu forsetar should be taken in all at once and in a proper way. Listen to it loud and the organ/electronic rumble connecting the melodic bits comes alive, with odd bits of noise perfectly mucking up the pristinely deep bass pedals. The held tones become vitally important as the piece progresses and the primary motif slows to a crawl; with more space between the notes the connecting drone that stretches to infinity becomes the focus. The horns are always around the corner. At times theyre wounded and barely able to sound, but theyre always there. Toward the end theres a stretch of silence almost two minutes long before one last gasp of the opening theme carries the piece out on an exhausted note.\nThis gorgeous package contains a DVD audio disc with a 5.1 surround sound mix that attempts to replicate the feel of the original performance (I dont have the technology to hear it, unfortunately). Virðulegu forsetar was first performed in 2003 at Hallgrimskirkja, a large cathedral in Reykjavik, and the album was recorded in the same space. During that first performance, players were positioned on all sides of the audience; it was spring in Iceland which meant a show starting around 11:00 p.m. would finish as the sun was setting. As a visual accompaniment, Jóhannsson filled the cathedral with helium balloons that were slightly underinflated, so that over the course of the piece they fell extremely slowly into the crowd.\nThink for a moment what a fantastically beautiful image this is. And yet, theres nothing to it. An epic space, sure, but beyond that were talking balloons, horns, and a keyboard. Careful gestures, simple tools, and a good mind are all Jóhannsson needs. This is the way to live.",

        "article_text": "Pop music gets off way too easily; so long as groups stick to only the sweetest melodies, throw in a couple of ba-ba-buhs and sing about how Staceys mom \"has got it goin on,\" or some other such timeless verse, theyre valued as somehow above the fray. It seems even the most venomous rock elitists can be defanged by a few simple hooks, turned endlessly forgiving by some easy harmonies. If Stalin himself had ruled with less of an iron fist and more Beach Boys-style harmonies, he might be remembered as much for his keen songwriting chops as for the wholesale slaughter of millions of his own people; such is the inexplicably titanic redemptive power of pop. That self-same blinding power is also why it takes a band as innovative as The Unicorns to throw the complacencies of pop into stark relief, to finally hold it accountable for such casual abuses.\nWhen its so easy for bands to stay behind the indie-pop curve that youd think someones handing out ice cream back there, The Unicorns are ahead. In fact, theyre so far ahead that superficial distinction becomes virtually unnecessary; theyre striking at the most fundamental structure of the pop song itself. Without scrutiny, Who Will Cut Our Hair When Were Gone?, their debut album for the otherwise experimental Canadian label Alien8, can pass for the same sort of sugar-glazed jangle-pop thats been done to death, but has nevertheless been beloved for years in indie circles; all the elements I just derided are present in abundance, right down to a rare few instances of smarmy lyrics. The band traffics in the occasional ooohs and aaahs, and relies on retro-basic keyboards for the requisite flourish above and beyond the standard guitar fuzz. And yet, The Unicorns toe the line of bedroom intimacy and heart-swelling wonder as perfectly as any of the modern masters of the form.\nIn that sense, they rival The Shins, or The Magnetic Fields, or any of the innumerable indie touchstones, but what truly sets Who Will Cut Our Hair apart is the near-total absence of traditional verse/chorus/verse framework in their songs; to nail beautiful, memorable lines with such remarkable ease is a feat unto itself, but to do so in essentially formless compositions is a different class of achievement entirely. Songs shift effortlessly from segment to segment, never relying upon the crutch of repetitive composition to create the illusion of a powerful hook. Thats not to say that motifs arent revisited throughout a song, but elementary concepts of A-B-A structure are abandoned in favor of brilliant, sprawling whole-song compositions.\nThese days, when \"epic\" describes a line at the bank, it doesnt seem adequate to describe the scope of some of these tunes, but itll have to suffice. \"Jellybones\" is a titanic wreck of styles and forms, offering glimpses of hooks that would serve other bands as whole songs like so many kittens; \"Tuff Ghost\" builds around two simple rhythmic shifts and never looks back, burning through a dozen variations of the songs central keyboard line. And the intricate plucking to open \"I Was Born (A Unicorn)\" gives way to a bizarre fiction: \"I was born a unicorn/ I missed the ark, but I couldve sworn/ Youd wait for me,\" then, \"So how come all the other unicorns are dead?\" This hilariously morbid variation on a typical theme of loss or abandonment is par for the course on Who Will Cut Our Hair, exemplifying how The Unicorns continually and effortlessly sap the drama from rocks favorite, most maudlin topics, and transform them into simple, charming, light-hearted fun. Its a big part of what separates them from all those careerist indie rockers getting by on everyday hooks and affected disinterest; even at their goofiest, The Unicorns level of comfort with their material-- and the obvious confidence that engenders-- makes it all seem totally natural and new.",

        "article_text": "Over the past few months, some of the more conservative members of British music press have put their Coral raves on hold long enough to document the demise of the Superclubs (e.g. Ministry of Sound, Cream, Gatecrasher) and the continued splintering of music listeners. Trotting out a series of \"Dance Music Is Dead\" pieces that amount to little more than lazy thinking and gleeful opportunism, many of these critics aim to deflate a music they never liked in the first place.\nHere in America, were slowly showing signs of shaking our deep-rooted discophobia. In recent years, indieland has finally embraced the post-punk that makes you wind up your waist instead of just standing around full of righteous political anger. In 2003, were finally loose-limbed and non-puritanical enough to be able to bestow the Second Annual Gang of Four Award-- presented to the most overused musical touchstone of the year-- upon Prince. At this rate, a revival fueled by re-writes of \"Can You Feel It?\", \"No Way Back\" and \"Voodoo Ray\" should hit American shores sometimes around 2043.\nOne problem with the typical dance rhetoric has been that it ignores most of the past thirty years of disco and its offshoots. At discos peak, its detractors and demolition crews resented what was seen as a culture of exclusivity and hedonism. The haters put Bianca Jagger and the Studio 54s white horse in the crosshairs, ignored the communal and utopian nature of the dancefloor, and-- with at least a tinge of homophobia-- associated the sound with being fake, evil, anti-human.\nSince then, dance musics entry in the rock-crit history books has been limited to the late 70s when the music was inescapable: a few years when an industry-fed orgy of overspending and over-saturation and the shaky work of disco tourists clouded its quality. But talking about American disco and ignoring Philly Soul, The Loft, Salsoul, disco (not disco) records and the dance end of post-punk, Arthur Russell, garage, electro and house is sort of like approaching the thirty-year history of American punk and forgetting The Stooges, New York Dolls, CBGBs, The Germs, Black Flag, and their L.A. cohorts, hardcore, emocore, and every underground band from K Street to Gilman Street to focus only on Green Day, Blink-182 and Good Charlotte.\nAnd yet, the winner takes it all, so with the blessing of the rock press, thats exactly whats happened.\nIn recent years, the non-rock world is again slowly incorporating pop/rock structures into their sound with great success. It was European dance DJs who made LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Radio 4, and the Electric Six names to drop. Bootleg culture did as much for The Strokes as it did for Xtina. Junior Seniors D-D-Dont Dont Stop the Beat is one of the best applications of the garage-rock revival. Outkasts Andre 3000 and the Luomo-versed Junior Boys have made two of 2003s best indie pop singles, and Bubba Sparxxxs \"Back in the Mud\" and Girls Alouds \"No Good Advice\" rock as engagingly and forcefully as most guitar bands. And now comes Basement Jaxx, who on their new record Kish Kash produce both some of the most propulsive, ferocious music of the year as well as some of the most poignant, and they do it in part with the sounds of the old-fangled geetar.\nKish Kash may not have highs as glorious as \"Red Alert\" or \"Romeo\", but its the most consistently entrancing record of Basement Jaxxs career, and one on which they largely turn their ear away from the dynamics and repetition of dance music. For instance, of the tracks here, only \"Supersonic\" wouldnt have stood out on their debut, Remedy-- and even that track doesnt feature houses traditional 4/4 beat. (Plus, it has a guitar solo!) A little darker and less playful than their previous efforts, the first half of the record takes the energy, velocity and thrust of \"Wheres Yo Head At?\" and adds a head-swimming number of sonic details, resulting in a series of dense dance-pop gems; the second half is more placid, built on acoustic guitars and broken hearts more than electronic dreams and broken beats.\nA pool of guest vocalists further enrich this material, adding an additional layer of variety to the albums already diverse palette. The Bellrays Lisa Kekaula opens the record in strong voice, riding a regal rave-up of guitar, strings and handclaps on \"Good Luck\", a defiant, acerbic nu-\"I Will Survive\". Siouxsie Siouxs pummeling anti-greed collaboration, \"Cish Cash\", knocks Fugazi back into Brent D.s record box and sends most of electroclash back to Williamsburg or The Hague with its tail between it legs. First single \"Lucky Star\" retains the peerless Dizzee Rascals eastern vibe while he thrillingly explains why he needs music to make him grow \"dy-na-mi-tee.\" And \"Plug It In\" bathes J.C. Chasez in a tide of sighs, brutish synths and whipsmart drum breaks. The most surprisingly successful collaborations, however, are from Meshell NdegéOcello, whose \"Right Heres the Spot\" is a more striking P-Funk/Prince (dig the \"Delirious\" reference) amalgamation than most of Speakerboxxx and more deliciously carnal than The Love Below. NdegéOcello also gives Kish Kash its tender close on the slow-burning \"Feels Like Home\", a fitting finale for its more stirring, introspective second half.\nYoud have gotten some pretty good odds at the beginning of the year that a Prince-influenced duo would wind up making one of the most sonically thrilling, genre-hopping records of the year, but it wasnt either of the more likely pairs that managed to do it. Pharrell and Chad treaded water, offering an album that consolidated their strengths but rarely approached their best work. Then Big Boi did his part, but Andre 3000 dropped the ball, creating a modern Lovesexy when a Dirty Mind would have been more rewarding. On Kish Kash, Basement Jaxx recover Dres fumble and move near the front of the 00s crop of rock-dance crossovers, a growing group of Paradise Garage rockers who, with luck, are a sign of the times.",

        "article_text": "“It’s really hard to even talk about the internet without seeming instantly corny,\" Ezra Koenig told Pitchfork recently, \"even the word blog sounds a little grandma-y.\" He should know. The Vampire Weekend singer and lyricist gave up on his own Blogspot site, Internet Vibes, seven years ago, as he finished up his English studies at Columbia University (the final posts title: \"I HATE BLOGGING\"). But before he graduated from the ye olde blogosphere, Koenig held forth on a vast array of topics-- from geography, to Wellington boots, to music writer Robert Christgaus allegedly unfair critique of Billy Joels oeuvre-- looking at everything from a incisively self-aware, curious, and optimistic angle. Whats most impressive is the way hes able to connect art and ideas from different eras and continents into a kind of ecstatic worldview. One particularly inspired ramble spins an analytic web from a friends visit to Morocco, the history of the Strait of Gibraltar, a 1984 interview between Bob Dylan and Bono, the film The Secret of Roan Inish, and National Geographics famed Afghan refugee cover-- and not only does it make sense, its written in a way thats funny and smart and completely inclusive. Pretty good for a 22-year-old kid from middle-class New Jersey. Now 28, Koenigs creative medium has changed, but his omnivorous cultural appetite has not.\nTake \"Step\", the third song on Vampire Weekends third album, Modern Vampires of the City-- the record that is already forcing one-time haters of this band to rethink their entire lives. At its core, the song reads like an ode to obsessive music fandom in which the object of Koenigs affection is \"entombed within boombox and walkman.\" Modest Mouse are name-checked. But the sense of infatuation extends beyond a list of influences and is embedded into the music itself. The chorus and parts of the melody are borrowed from wordy Oakland rap act Souls of Mischiefs \"Step to My Girl\"-- which itself samples Grover Washington, Jr.s version of a Bread song called \"Aubrey\". But \"Step\" avoids back-patting nostalgia and debunks bogus generational hierarchies while using the past to inspire the present. Its also melancholy, with Vampire Weekend musical mastermind Rostam Batmanglij surrounding Koenigs musings with lilting harpsichord ambience. Because, as we know, music is a young mans pursuit. \"Wisdoms a gift but youd trade it for youth,\" Koenig sings.\nStill, Vampire Weekend make a damn good case for wisdom all across Modern Vampires. Yes, this is a more grown-up album. It largely trades in the Africa-inspired giddiness of their first two records for a sound thats distinctly innate and closer to the ear. Theres more air in these songs, more spontaneity, more dynamics. The overarching themes-- death and a dubious sense of faith-- are certainly Serious. But you never feel like youre being preached at while listening to this album. Koenig and company are probably more clever and gifted than you, sure-- but theyre not rubbing your face in it or anything. Their message is one of collective understanding and betterment, and Modern Vampires is the kind of album thatll have you Googling for Buddhist temples and Old Testament allusions at 3 a.m. while listening to reggae great Ras Michael (whos sampled on opener \"Obvious Bicycle\"). Now, you dont have to get obsessed to enjoy this music, but its presented with such care that you cant help but want to learn about its deeper meanings. So while Koenig gave up a potential teaching career to take his chances as a rock singer, hes still doling out knowledge in his own way.\nThough the record often traverses in darkness-- the zipped-tight \"Finger Back\" alludes to historic atrocities and brutality while \"Hudson\", easily the bands bleakest track to date, imagines an apocalyptic Manhattan-- theres also hope here. Partly because Vampire Weekend seem to have internalized all of the positive traits of their internet-soaked generation while resisting the ugly ones: theyll offer jokes and humanity on Twitter without navel-gazing; theyll play a concert for a credit-card company while roping in Steve Buscemi for promo videos that are no-shit funny; theyll use the tools of modernity to expand their universe rather than contract it. And then theyll go ahead and crack your heart in two.\nAlong with the more lived-in sonics, Modern Vampires has the band taking a leap forward into emotional directness. Koenig and Batmanglij truly seem of one mind here, as the vocals and music interact with each other in an effortless flow. While skronks and snares pop on \"Diane Young\", the singer matches the live-fast intensity hit-for-hit. The song is a dissection of the 27 Club rocknroll myth, where Koenigs voice on the sly \"baby, baby, baby\" bridge is manipulated to intoxicating effect.\nThen theres \"Hannah Hunt\". In some sense, it seems like Vampire Weekends entire career thus far has led to this one song. It begins with the hiss of wind and some vague background chatter-- the sounds of the everyday-- before its all quickly tuned out in favor of Batmanglijs piano and bassist Chris Baios upright plucks. Koenig comes in soft, telling of a couple on a cross-country road trip. His details-- crawling vines, mysterious men of faith, newspaper kindling-- are sparse, delicate, perfect. And then, after two minutes and 40 seconds of quiet beauty, the song blooms, and Koenig lets it absolutely rip: \"If I cant trust you then damn it, Hannah/ Theres no future/ Theres no answer/ Though we live on the U.S. dollar/ You and me, we got our own sense of time.\" On an album preoccupied with the ominous ticking of clocks, this is the moment that stops them cold.\nKoenig has said in recent interviews that the bands three albums make up a trilogy. \"Hannah Hunt\" could be a sobering continuation of Contras Springsteen-ian \"Run\", where two people decide to up and leave their known lives in search of some sort of American transcendence. Theres also a perilous chandelier at the center of new track \"Everlasting Arms\", perhaps a callback to the hanging lights that cover the bands debut LP. And the Modern Vampires font is the same exact one used in a trailer for Koenigs absurd-looking college-era werewolf movie, from which Vampire Weekend got its name. These little links are not only satisfying, but inevitable. After years of engaging with anything and everything in reach, Vampire Weekend are now a primary source in their own right.",

        "article_text": "Its hard to imagine what spurred the density and gloom of Turn on the Bright Lights, an album that, in retrospect, sounds like a popular band reacting to massive overexposure; its masterful statement of bruised withdrawal begged to divide a large fanbase, not create one. There was nothing about Interpols self-contained, visionary debut that might have suggested their subsequent eyebrow-raising catapult to fame, particularly given their aversion to the traditional single format. Perhaps Paul Banks lucid expression of discontent and impending dread spoke to an increasingly frustrated audience inundated by a generalized threat. Or maybe Interpols popularity is simply a case of viscerally powerful music confounding formulas of public taste, breaking through purely on the basis of songwriting merit. Either way, Bright Lights set an immeasurably high mark to follow, and its popularity has ensured equally high stakes: If the band stumbles, their humiliation will be very public.\nFortunately, the members of Interpol understand what other bands take for granted: Careers arent necessarily made or broken by second albums alone, and an ideal follow-up neednt engage the perceived potential of a defining debut or consciously redefine a pre-established sound in order to be effective. Redefinition, in particular, is a non-issue for Interpol, because one of the most enduring pleasures of their first album is its timeless singularity. Accordingly, it has been well understood that Antics wasnt going to be, nor could it be, Bright Lights 2. Bootleg versions of new material-- notably the live recordings of \"Narc\" and \"Length of Love\" that leaked last summer-- didnt suggest a radically altered aesthetic or faceless repetition, nor does Antics deliver either. Interpol avoid common sophomore pitfalls because they refuse to engage the immense weight that surrounds this release, and their tenuous position between shrewd self-consciousness and diversionary costume changing informs this albums openness and plasticity.\nAntics exudes a preceding aura of heaviness-- even the packaging is heavy; the albums cryptic liner notes consist of little more than stark grayscale photos and epigrammatic Morse code spelling out bits of song titles (\"Length\", \"Narc\", \"Cruise\", \"Exit\", respectively). An image from the bands debut appears on the first single, \"Slow Hands\", and becomes a representative metaphor for the album as a whole: After reflecting on the aftermath of a soured relationship, Banks takes the \"weights\" described in Bright Lights \"Obstacle 1\" from his \"little heart\" and projects them onto the woman who presumably put them there to begin with. Musically, however, the song is far removed from the layered density of Interpols former material, exhibiting pristine, unmuddied production and a chorus (\"We spies/ We slow hands/ You put the weights all around yourself\") that slithers and stomps with post-punk dance-floor swagger. Similarly, Antics casts off the weight of advance hype, stewing anticipation, and unreasonable expectations, and wisely distinguises itself as a strong collection of singles rather than as an immaculately cohesive album. And, where Interpol were once synonymous with emotive desolation, they here opt for an atmosphere of poignant resignation.\nOpener \"Next Exit\" is immediately jarring; a tranquilized doo-wop organ progression and spare percussion announce a very different band. It is explicitly clear that Interpol have changed, from the bands more casual tone (\"We aint going to the town/ Were going to the city/ Gonna track this shit around\") to new mixing techniques: Carlos Ds bass and Daniel Kesslers guitar are relatively hushed in the mix to make room for Banks underscored vocals, allowing him a range of expression previously unexplored and buoying the bands newfound pop leanings with lyrical eloquence. His vocals on tracks like \"Narc\" soar where they were once buried in the impermeable fog of their surroundings, and many who found his delivery in the past to be occasionally monotonous (company that includes Banks himself) will find his melodic range here to be a welcome change of pace.\nAlthough most songs evince a clear shift to singles territory, a natural progression of the bands sound is evident. \"Evil\" employs a Pixies-esque bassline and upbeat rhythm section to counterbalance its ambiguously bleak lyrical themes. The band demonstrates judicious restraint on \"Narc\", relegating a potentially overbearing blanket of synth strings and organ to a peripheral role while punching up Kesslers crisp guitar lines and Carlos Ds almost imperceptibly fluid bass work. The syncopated funk bassline and disco-pop rhythm of \"Length of Love\" initially seem to be at odds with the songs lush orchestration, but these counter-intuitive touches add a dynamic element to the limited confines of the songs composition. The band hasnt lost its knack for exploration and epic construction, though; \"Take You on a Cruise\", \"Not Even Jail\", and \"Public Pervert\" steep the albums middle section in the kind of dark theatricality that distinguished their debut, while the expansive \"A Time to Be So Small\", with its deliberate pacing and depiction of \"cadaverous mobs,\" concludes Antics with unsettling macabre.\nThough Interpol couldnt be expected to surpass their previous heights, its difficult to imagine a savvier or more satisfying second step. But the real revelation is that the band has wisely ignored a shortsighted perception of their career which dictates that where Bright Lights was an audacious plunge from a great height, Antics is the crucial landing. Even on those terms the band has succeeded. However, their liberation of form emphasizes the fact that, in the grand scheme of Interpols career, this is only one in a series of great, if not Great, albums. Antics shows Interpol shedding the weight of their accumulated baggage and (hopefully) staying a while.",

        "article_text": "With each new album it becomes clearer that Animal Collective will not stay still. You can see them on tour and get a preview of the album to come in their live show, but aside from that, its difficult to tell which direction their music will go next. If youd heard Spirit Theyre Gone or Danse Manatee you could possibly have predicted the more difficult and abstract direction of Here Comes the Indian but you wouldnt have guessed theyd make something like Campfire Songs around the same time; if youd heard the latter youd might hazard a guess about Sung Tongs but Feels wouldnt necessarily strike you as the work of the same band.\nThat said, the newly released Feels is not a total departure from Sung Tongs, and it actually tracks it quite closely in terms of the albums structure. Its apparent from the first few bars of \"Did You See the Words\" that A.C. begins in \"song\" mode, setting aside for the moment the soundscaping that defined the earlier records. The first spin is a tad disconcerting because, with its electric guitar and more trad band set-up, Animal Collective sound for the first time like what theyve always been to detractors with more outré tastes: an indie rock band. The songs proceed with a logic that has more to do with the early experiments of Mercury Rev than say, Sebadoh, but where Animal Collective previously sounded as if they were working according to an unusual set of rules, the first half of Feels exists in relationship to music history, and not just any music history, but rock.\nI hear the ghosts of 1950s artists like Buddy Holly inside more straightforward pop songs \"Grass\" and \"The Purple Bottle\". On \"Grass\", the reverb on Avey Tares voice adds a hiccup to every syllable and the guitar is processed to sound at times like the rollicking boogie-woogie piano rhythm. Of course, 50 years ago no one would have made a chorus out of loud, clipped screams synchronized to bashed drums (well, maybe Jerry Lee Lewis), and the conversational vocal harmony breakdown of \"The Purple Bottle\" jumps ahead a decade to a highly psychedelicized Beach Boys. Such moments are why the adolescent unpredictability of Animal Collective is such an asset-- theyre able to tap into the narrative of Western pop while making it their own.\nLike Animal Collectives previous full length, Feels is sequenced carefully, with jauntier, tuneful numbers leading to an amorphous back half. The two transitional songs in the records middle, \"Bees\" and \"Banshee Beat\", are among the best things Animal Collective has done. \"Bees\" imagines how a drifting pop song might sound inside the sonic universe of an Alice Coltrane album, with a trebly autoharp that is all strings and no body and sustained clusters of piano that bring to mind an ascension through clouds. \"Banshee Beat\" is even better. Animal Collectives signature approach to composition-- in which open chords are strummed repeatedly for longer than seems necessary to create a unique sense of tension relieved only by vocal chants and howls-- finds its apotheosis over these eight minutes. \"Daffy Duck\" is a further exploration of the ideas presented on \"Bees\", and \"Loch Raven\" is an uncharacteristically tender electro-acoustic lullaby, vaguely Aphexian in the way it mixes sine wave drones with a simple piano line and a cluster of wordless voices.\nThe upbeat \"Turn Into Something\" brings the album back to where it started. Feels is an excellent record, one that, despite a more conventional approach, happens to get better over time. But its also interesting to contemplate as a chapter in the Animal Collective story. If the childhood pals can stay friends and continue to inspire each other we may have some more great records down the road. At the moment they seem on a pretty heady plateau, but you dont get the idea listening to Feels that theyve said nearly all they have to say.\n ",

        "article_text": "With the cash from the Thesaurus Musicarum sales snowing in, Editor-in-Chief Ryan Schreiber decided to treat the entire staff of Pitchfork to a weekend retreat at Steamers, a Finnish bath/scat fetish \"bunny ranch\" in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Having just completed principle photography on a documentary biopic detailing my creative life, I decided to tag along despite no longer feeling part of the team. Due to seniority, Ryan gave me the back bench on the bus. As the fresh writers swapped customized iPod skins and debated the cultural impact of Xiu Moo, I counted passing silos while listening to worn Britpop mix cassettes and neurotically rubbing the growing bald spot on my scalp. Ryan slipped in next to me. He pulled a maroon jewelry box from his Member's Only. \"I was going to wait to give this to you,\" he said. \"Oh, I, thanks,\" I said. Inside the box sat a green lapel pin shaped like the number six laid over Poseidon's trident. \"It's a service pin. It's jade,\" Ryan said. \"Yeah, I get the joke. I just don't see why six years is an anniversary to celebrate,\" I said. \"That's how long the Pixies were around. Besides, I wanted to ask you to write a new review,\" he said. \"Ah, Jesus, man, I knew there was a catch,\" I sighed. \"No, no, hear me out. I really want you to do one of your trademark concept reviews. Those always get tons of hits. People love them and hate them,\" he said. \"Ryan, that cow is dried up. It's Gordita meat. I've even done the I'm-not-going-to-do-a-concept-review-anymore concept review,\" I said. \"Hear me out. I'm seeing a comeback for one of your zany characters,\" Ryan said, making stupid TV-producer gestures with his hands. \"I'm seeing the interpretive dancer Santa Schultz, the Revolutionary War soldier Ham Grass, advice columnist Professor Rok, Diapers the glam-loving lab monkey, Justin Davies the bass player of The Hold My Coat, The Bummelg�_rk, Kelly the Masseuse, Volodrag the Yugoslavian sycophant, Paul Bunyan, Wolfie. Besides, you promised me the Franz Ferdinand review months ago.\" He had a point. I had procrastinated on a promise. I looked up the aisle of the bus and spotted Ott hunched over a laptop, biting his tongue and copying studiously from a Thesaurus. No, no, Franz Ferdinand was the perfect vehicle for a comeback. I'm half Hungarian. My family had two dogs named Huszar. I've been looking for a way to work schnauzers and Magyar into a review. It didn't have to be that contrived. The parallels were fluorescent: Franz and I were both stubbornly nostalgic for the decade-gone heights of Britpop. In their silk button-downs and slickly combed hair, the band mimicked the gauche decadence of Suede to such a point that it appeared they were wearing Anderson and Butler's hand-me-down menswear. Each song on their self-titled debut catwalk swaggered with sucked-in cheeks like Alex James' effortless bounce on Blur's \"Girls \u0026 Boys\". If that sounds too hopelessly recent and uncool for the hipsters, I could go obtuse and say Franz Ferdinand revive the sounds of the John Cale-era Squeeze or the New York never-weres The Necessaries. I could erroneously throw Franz Ferdinand in with the recent dance-punk, freak-shit, whatever \"scene.\" But I'm calling a spade a spade. Call it Scotpop if you feel uncomfortable. Not content to kickstart their career on an album laden mostly with potential, the Glaswegians have banged out a celebratory LP with lyrics bearing surprising satire, wit, and unabashed romance. On the upcoming single, \"Dark of the Matinee\", Alexander Kapranos positions himself as a bitter cynic who eventually gives in to fame (though it may be, as the title suggests, in the dimmer regions of the spotlight) after being charmed by an attractive optimist, and, one would imagine, the unapologetic funk of the track itself. By the last verse, Kapranos imagines himself smiling wide, sitting with Abba-loving AM talk show host Terry Wogan. With their meteoric rise, Franz Ferdinand could very well be within a year of it. They're poised to be the next Duran Duran or the next Pulp. Or they could be the next Menswear. In any case, it will be a spectacle. \"Jacqueline\" opens the album deceivingly with gentle acoustic strums and student poem prattle before raygun guitars and splashing cymbals annihilate any notion of plaintive reflection. Kaparanos soon blurts phrases like \"it's so much better on holiday,\" \"I'm so drunk I don't mind if you kill me,\" \"I'm alive, I'm alive,\" and \"we need the money.\" The pace never lets up. Even their breakthrough single, \"Take Me Out\", blatantly changes its mind from Pixies-like pop to squiggly guitar disco a quarter of the way through. Only on \"Cheating on You\" do the drums drop their high-hat riding for stuttering punk. Franz Ferdinand rarely stray far from the dueling-guitars-with-occasional-keyboard approach, granting even the bounciest dance floor numbers pleasantly rough edges, but the final two tracks peak with greater arrangement and studio flourish. Flashy flanger-flecked guitar and layered, lachrymose keyboards add an epic air to the tale of confused post-relationship emotions of \"Come on Home\", while \"40 Ft\" tiptoes in on spy guitars. Like the overlooked brilliance of Parklife's Side B, the song turns back to triumphant, operatic music spiked with pessimism and noise. Even Damon Albarn's beloved melodica makes an appearance 2\\xBD minutes in. Like all lasting records, Franz Ferdinand steps up to the plate and boldly bangs on the door to stardom. There's no consideration for what trends have just come and gone. There's no waffling or concessions for people who won't get it. As with all great entertainment, it will divide opinion. I honestly couldn't remember Volodrag, The Hold My Coat, Santa Schultz, or the bands in whose reviews they appeared. I'd made that stuff up to amuse myself during boring albums. As I told Ryan, Franz Ferdinand didn't need a concept. We would all remember this one. Like that wizard's cap.",

        "article_text": "Many Yo La Tengo fans suspected the bands best days were behind them after Summer Sun. Even the title was a bummer. In my mind I saw it as Setting Sun, and later thought of Around the Sun, both of which brought to mind autumn twilight, a slow fade into darkness, and the onset of a deadening winter. And while the music wasnt terrible (and had at least an enjoyable ambience), it sounded like it came from a band that was locked into something-- like Yo La Tengo had found a measured style they could tweak until they got bored of the band and called it quits. \"If this is truly the next step in Yo La Tengos move toward some abstract concept like artistic maturity,\" Eric Carr wrote in his Pitchfork review, \"I dont think I want to stick around for the conclusion.\"\nHearing their newest record, Im hoping Eric hasnt left the building. From the opening bass growl of \"Pass the Hatchet, I Think Im Goodkind\", its a new morning on planet YLT. Right off, Georgia Hubley and James McNew are thriving on a riff and Ira Kaplan has his meanest distortion pedal out of hock kicking up clouds of noise because he can. And Id forgotten how cool he can sound when singing. Here hes Joe Walsh bragging about a fully stocked medicine cabinet and the processing of his voice is perfect, with flanged midrange to accentuate his knowing calm. But Yo La Tengo wouldnt truly be back if they stayed in one place, and the following \"Beanbag Chair\" is a complete 180, a cuddly piano-driven ditty with velvety harmonies that wants nothing more than to find its way onto a prospective girlfriends mixtape.\nAnd thats the story here. Yo La Tengo have always sounded more in love with music than pretty much any indie band going, and theyve let their diverse interests settle into a comfortable and productive place conducive to growing good songs. Everything theyve done well in the past is found on here somewhere, even a couple of the gossamer mood pieces that previously threatened to smother their career like a damp wool blanket. An album of songs like \"I Feel Like Going Home\" might be trouble, but here it sounds just fine: Theres lovely and subtle processing behind the piano and violin, and Georgia Hubleys voice has become a remarkably supple instrument. Its a real trick when you have her limited range to avoid sounding distant and bored, but completely inhabits her leads. The jaunty \"The Weakest Part\" hits the same sweet spot. It could be a nice Belle \u0026 Sebastian song, with its bouncy piano, easy harmonies, and taut construction.\nThe production is simple but not minimal. It feels overtly \"classic\" more than anything, with arrangements and instrumentation deliberately plucked from a wide range of rock and r\u0026b sides from the past half-century. The horns backing James McNews and Kaplans falsettos on \"Mr. Tough\" are ladled from Memphis soul stew, punctuating the playfully phrased dancefloor challenge to a bully. \"The Room Got Heavy\", with its bongos and Martin Rev organ, is part skuzzy 70s-NYC racket, but Hubley humanizes and prettifies the drone and turns it into something approaching a song. The long instrumental \"Daphnia\", probably inspired by Yo La Tengos now substantial movie-scoring side career, is more engaging than it has any right to be. Its just a guitar plucking a couple notes over and over while some crackly sound effects rustle in the background, and a creepy piano line ghosted from a John Carpenter score. And then, the scrappy \"Watch out for Me Ronnie\", with Kaplan half-yelling through a busted microphone, sounds like a lost Nuggets classic having a drink with the closing theme from \"WKRP in Cincinnati\".\nYes, \"Black Flowers\" is underwritten and drab, and \"Songs for Mahila\" is pretty enough but just sort of floats out the window, but hey, there are 15 songs and 77 minutes of music here, and its not a perfect record. But rather than sounding overstuffed, I Am Not Afraid of You... sounds like a double album in the 70s sense, a chance for the band to stretch out and try everything in their repertoire even if the end result is a little shaggy. Really, this kind of committed and sincere musical sampler is the most natural place in the world for Yo La Tengo to be, but it wasnt clear if theyd ever find their way back.",

        "article_text": "The interface between the voice and technology is central to Juliana Barwicks art. A Louisiana-born, Brooklyn-based singer who previously released the album Sanguine and the EP Florine, Barwick makes music whose raw material is almost exclusively her voice. But its hard to know what she might sound like alone in a room. When she records, Barwick layers and processes and twists her utterances into figures that can alternately be described as familiar, soothing, alien, and tense. She might bring to mind the bright harmonies of Panda Bear or the mystical invocations of Elizabeth Fraser, but her approach is her own.\nThats partly because her music feels homemade. We know that she spent a lot of time in church as a kid, so its tempting to think of her work as a digital update on sacred hymns. The heavy reverb and layering brings to mind cathedrals, light refracted through stained glass, some kind of surrender to or celebration of the eternal. But while Barwick can seem to be reaching for these grand themes and overwhelming statements, theres something in her music that brings it back down to earth. It feels human, imperfect, and intimate, and the line of communication is one-to-one. Despite her musics often epic sweep, it can feel like she is whispering in our ears. So the sense of the sublime, which permeates every note of her material, ultimately works on a humble scale.\nWeve grown used to following along with artists from their first demo to their first self-released EP to their debut album and then their breakthrough moment courtesy of a company that specializes in caffeinated sugar water. But Barwick works slowly and carefully. She had a little bump with the issue of her debut in 2007, returned with a small-scale EP two years later that received a handful of positive reviews, and has presumably been spending the interim figuring out how to make something even better. The Magic Place, her first album for Asthmatic Kitty, stands above her earlier work in virtually every way. She sings better, the structures are more patient and enveloping, the layering is more precise, and she makes much more effective use of instrumentation. It has the feel of a modest classic of post-millennial ambient music, the kind of record that sounds gorgeous and immersive on first listen and never loses its sparkle, whether playing in the background or filling a room with its swells.\nOne of the secrets to The Magic Places enduring appeal, the way it holds up to repeated listens, has to do with that aforementioned imperfection. Though Barwicks essential tool is the loop, she has a way of structuring them so they never seem too locked into the grid. They tumble and unspool and break into the silence like waves, but they are not easily reduced to units of sound dragged from a window onto a timeline. The imperfection gives a feeling of instability to these tracks. So \"Keep Up the Good Work\" mixes piercing high-pitched voices that a friend compared to the malevolent siren calling distant ships into the rocks and then folds in indecipherable low-pitched murmurs, hints of bass, and a piano line that sounds like a bag of pebbles falling onto the keys. It rolls forward but with an unstable gait, so the shimmering prettiness of the layers never feels too ordered and predictable.\nShe takes a similar approach on \"Cloak\", but the effect is less creepy and leans more in the direction of awe, a mini celebration of the idea of ethereality. \"Prizewinning\" combines her high/low voices in loops that spread like fractals with a marching guitar/drum figure that bores through the center of the track and makes it feel a little like two complementary songs playing at once. Its in these moments, where loops dangle and collide but dont quite line up, that Barwick seems most indebted to the process music of Eno. The way the units of sound in Thursday Afternoon and the reconstituted Pachelbel of Discreet Music develop bears a marked similarity to the easy unpredictability these tracks present.\nIs something beautiful and ethereal that feels timeless and transcendent enough? What keeps Barwick from being the \"indie rock Enya,\" which is the phrase that popped into my head when I first heard her music in 2007? Its not an easy question to answer. I want to say that the encroaching creepiness and human blemishes elevate Barwicks music above the soothing Calgon bath of new age, but Im not quite convinced thats true. Im also not sure that it matters. Part of it has to do with where we are living now, and how music functions in our lives. Complaints about the one-dimensionality of new age feel less relevant when we have so much music easily at our disposal. The Magic Place is music for a specific constellation of feelings. They are real, many people share them, and this album owns them completely. So while there are few identifiable words here and the titles dont really register, theres a hell of a lot being expressed. We may not need Barwick to go deep into darkness or to write words that mean something, because she has tapped a vein of expression that is rich and powerful and affecting and even useful. And for the time being, the vein seems to be hers alone, though we can visit any time we like.",

        "article_text": "\"This is a foreground.\" That was the last lyric left hovering in the mist of Grizzly Bears breakout 2009 album, Veckatimest, and its a pretty good image to describe what its like to listen to one of their records. The key word there is \"a,\" signifying one of many. Whether its the ethereal, friendly-ghost vibes of Yellow House or Veckatimests pristine chamber pop, Grizzly Bear create music in deep focus; whats going on in the margins of their songs is just as important and expressive as the center. Taking cues from artists like Talk Talk and Van Dyke Parks, the Brooklyn four-piece make pop music with an ear for the ambient, asking us to notice the importance in detail, the beauty of texture, and the foregrounds that exist all across our spectrum of perception.\nWhile theres no question that Grizzly Bears last two records have sounded gorgeous, critics of the band have wondered if thats enough. Shields, the bands fourth and most compositionally adventurous record, should put those concerns to bed. Though full of baroque, detail-rich production and latticework melodies, Shields also offers an emotionally resonant core. The album is an excavation of loneliness, melancholy, and self-reliance. Its also a demanding record, without an instantly gratifying single like \"Knife\" or \"Two Weeks\" to hook restless ears. But the rewards that come from immersing yourself in it are odd and profound. Shields feels like a summation of Grizzly Bears strengths, drawing a line from the muddy, minor key sonic palette of Ed Drostes home-recorded Horn of Plenty and stringing it to the heels of boundless ambition.\nShields spectacular opener, \"Sleeping Ute\", is the lone track retained from an aborted early session in Marfa, Tex., and it feels like a continuation down the path Daniel Rossen ambled on his 2012 solo EP, Silent Hour/Golden Mile, which sought solace from a busy life in the elements. \"If I could be still as that gray hill,\" Rossen pines, before giving into an admission of humanness: \"But I cant help myself.\" Chris Bears drum rolls emulate thunder while chords crest with the rhythm of waves. \"Sleeping Ute\" moves so evocatively and theatrically like water that it sounds like a big-budget radio play of The Tempest. But as grandiose as it often gets, \"Ute\", like Shields itself, always retains a certain intimacy. These are dark and anxious waters, the choppy and tumultuous movement of the sea inside.\nGrizzly Bear have acquired a reputation for politeness; maybe it was the bow ties, maybe it was the passive-aggressive inflection of their most famous lyrics (\"Would you always? Maybe sometimes? Make it easy?\"), maybe it was just that Michael McDonald collaboration. But Shields serves as a visceral reminder of how unsettled and uncanny Grizzly Bears music often feels. (Remember that superbly creepy video for \"Two Weeks,\" full of smiles pulled tight enough to induce nightmares?) The pair of lead-off singles, \"Sleeping Ute\" and \"Yet Again\", each find a way of transcending the tension of \"putting on appearances,\" one of Grizzly Bears favorite themes. The lyrics of the Droste-led \"Yet Again\" detail repression and repose (\"Take it all in stride/ Speak, dont confide\"), which makes the payoff-- a final minute of instrumental fury lead by the torrent of Chris Bears percussion and the squiggling lightning strikes of Rossens guitar-- that much more cathartic. Dynamic shifts like this give the record an air of uncertainty that contrasts with the sheer beauty of the arrangements. \nGrizzly Bear is a democracy. They stand in a horizontal row on stage, and you get this sense of intra-band egalitarianism from their records, too. By now, each of the four members has cultivated his own unique and expressive vocabulary, and each feels integral to the sound of Shields. Chris Bears drumming is lyrical and swift, moving from delicately timed details to big, booming ruckuses (check out the way his percussive rumbles in the background of the verses of \"Yet Again\" foreshadow its avalanche of a conclusion), while Chris Taylors penchant for haunting effects and gently buoyant grooves adds an otherworldly weightlessness to these soundscapes. Drostes voice resounds with ache and longing, and theres a newfound and welcome gravel to his vocals that add a raw, unvarnished quality to songs like \"The Hunt\" and \"Speaking in Rounds\".\nBut Shields showcases Rossens growth most of all. The songs that sounded distinctly his on Yellow House-- \"Little Brother\" and \"On a Neck, On a Spit\" in particular-- were grounded in a familiar folk sound. But from the rollicking strums that propel \"Speaking in Rounds\" to the creaking, rusted textures he teases out of \"The Hunt\", Rossens playing on Shields is a seamless blend of folksy textures, jazzy fluidity, and proggy imagination that feels downright inimitable. Joni Mitchell has called her own idiosyncratic tunings as \"chords of inquiry,\" and this feels like an apt term for the tones and inflections that Rossen conjures too. Theyre stirring precisely because theyre unresolved: the progression that ends \"Speaking in Rounds\" chorus, for example, chirps like a series of unanswered questions, each one a little more urgent and insoluble than the last.\nAnd thats a great part of Shields emotional pull: The album reverberates with a sense of irresolution. This was present before with Grizzly Bear-- Yellow Houses \"Colorado\" concludes with a fireworks display of unanswered pleas: \"What now? What now? What now?\"-- but never to such a degree. And its that tension that makes returning to Shields so rewarding. The final one-two punch is a stunner, where the poignant grace of \"Half-Gate\" gives way to the magnificently epic \"Sun in Your Eyes\". If \"Sleeping Ute\" was the start of a sojourn from society, \"Sun\" ends not with a return but a transcendent kiss-off: \"So long, Im never coming back.\"\nThis closing pair of songs speaks to the albums complexity. Despite the formalism and easy-to-love production, Shields best moments inflict a sense of unease that wriggles under the skin and lingers after the final crescendo. But this collection of unvarnished shipwreck-spirituals is after something more challenging than a feel-good ending. With Shields, Grizzly Bear make certain demands--hold still, listen closely-- that seem downright radical in a busy and impatient world.",

        "article_text": "Tom Krell has never been shy about naming his influences. On Love Remains, his How to Dress Well debut, they were pop and R\u0026B acts like Ready For the World, Shai, Michael Jackson, and Bobby Brown. Hes no less forthcoming about the inspirations behind his heartbreaking second LP, Total Loss. During the penultimate apologia \"Set It Right\", he provides a roll call: Ryan, Dan, Mama, Grandma, Francey, Robbie, Nicky, and the list goes on. None of them are famous, none are musicians. Theyre real people in Krells life. Some have died (his uncle and best friend), others are living but have slipped out of view, many including himself are struggling with depression. So the title Total Loss gives you fair warning about what to expect. Where Love Remains drew much of its power from emotional suggestion and tactile sensation, Total Loss uses the common tools of pop expression-- four-minute songs, autobiography, choruses, confession-- to create a work of poignant and devastating art.\nThe cruel irony of Total Loss is that it finds Krell striving for directness and candor with family members whove become unavailable to him through breakups, depression, addiction, or death. The records first lyric-- \"You were there for me when I was in trouble/ You could understand for me that life was a struggle\"-- is addressed to Krells mother and reprised later on. Otherwise, the listener is in the position of the \"you\" populating so many of Krells thoughts.\nThe sleek, alabaster sound of Total Loss is a far cry from the heavily distorted and distant Love Remains. That album wasnt considered a drug record for the same reasons Ambien isnt considered recreational, but its shrouded production mimicked the effect the drug can have when it starts to kick in: the sensation of controlling yourself in an out-of-body experience. That feeling is foreign to Total Loss. Its still flooded with reverb, but the anesthetic is gone.  \nAs a result, Total Loss feels subject to heightened sensitivity both sonically and lyrically, and the effect is made more unnerving by the sharp, sudden movements of its elements-- harp plucks, ticking hi-hats, slapped snares and, of course, Krells own voice. Its high, thin, and boyish, but in no way timid. His quavering falsetto creates an intriguing friction against the newly aggressive, seething tone of his lyrics, particularly when he grapples with the self-blame, hopelessness, and betrayal that survivors of suicide victims often experience. \"Say My Name or Say Whatever\" begins with a recording of a homeless teen from the 1984 documentary Streetwise describing the freeing effects of flight. \"The only bad part about flying,\" he says, \"is having to come back down to the fuckin world,\" a projection of Krells own idealism and disillusionment.\nThough it contains Total Losss most visceral, even sexual music, \"Cold Nites\" sounds downright angry. The hook boasts, \"But I keep on doing it/ Aint gonna stop until were through with this,\" and its an anger born from Krells perception of his own shortcomings-- \"Tell me what Ive got to do to get better.\"  Album opener \"When I Was in Trouble\" is a piano hymn that takes its cues from William Basinskis Disintegration Loops, decaying in real time. Krell moans, \"Dear Mama, didnt you try to tell me everything was going to be safe?\" and then repeats the line in a rare lower register. The effect is chilling, and indicative of the confusion that permeates Total Loss: Whether Krell is trying to find relief in hurting himself or others is left open-ended.\nFortunately, How to Dress Wells malleability prevents Krell from getting too ponderous. If you found his orchestral direction on last years Just Once promising, theres the string interlude of \"World I Need You, Wont Be Without You (Proem)\" which is reprised on the emotive centerpiece \"Talking to You\". \"\u0026 It Was U\" pulls a similar deception, as Krells accumulating harmonies disguise an imploding relationship over joyous new jack swing. It maybe lacks the shock of his earliest singles, and thats fine: Coming from someone discovering that his love for a style of music and his ability to pay it homage are starting to intersect, its every bit as promising.   \nThe rhythmic backbone of Total Losss second half slackens a little, which can make the album feel frontloaded on the first few passes. Though Love Remains was more of a compilation than a proper album, its highlights were spread out judiciously. Total Loss doesnt fully compensate for its lack of clear standouts like \"Decisions\" or \"Ready for the World\", but it does benefit from a narrative cohesion that Love Remains lacked. Its path of grief follows psychologys Kübler-Ross model in chronology, from denial to bargaining to something resembling acceptance-- the lyric sheet even shows a smiley-face emoticon appending the \"Set It Right\" line, \"as far as love goes, its one step at a time.\" \"Struggle\" revisits Krells love for blown-out reverb, obscuring gut-punch lyrics that attempt to reconcile the joys of reckless behavior with that sort of actions deadly, consumptive attraction: \"I remember drinking with you in your bed… But in the morning wed go and start again.\" And while \"Ocean Floor for Everything\" wasnt a stunning first single, erring too close to melodies Krell has used before, its an apt sendoff for Total Loss, the point where the pain has settled in. But any hope here is implied. Its not explicitly a happy ending.\nIts a fitting conclusion to a record that is very lonely for Krell and risky for How to Dress Well. In light of the \"PBR\u0026B\" digs that initially circled Love Remains, its notable that many of the most exciting artists to arrive in its wake (the Weeknd, Jessie Ware, AlunaGeorge) are nominally \"indie\" but incorporate modernist R\u0026B in a similar manner. Krell hasnt benefited much from that swell of momentum, operating in a space thats far more niche and less overtly \"pop,\" in both genre and populism. But Total Loss is similar to the xxs Coexist in retreating to further minimalism and introspection after a groundbreaking debut. It feels like more of a success because theres no dissonance between its artistic intent and its optimal home-alone listening experience. Its effectiveness is a result of its intimacy-- or, as Krell puts it on \"Set It Right\", being \"true to you, Im true to me, too.\"",

        "article_text": "To begin to understand where Jessie Ware is coming from, lets look at her stuck between an acoustic guitarist and an MPC beat pusher in the back of a London taxi. As part of the simple, self-explanatory \"Black Cab Sessions\" web series, the 27-year-old British singer recently took her place in the middle seat and proceeded to offer a nuanced live take on \"Wildest Moments\", a slyly epic ballad from her debut album, Devotion. In such tight quarters, shes not quite sure where to look-- at her bandmates, outside to the street, or directly into the camera-- her head on a controlled swivel. Shes capable of blasting the back window out with her voice, which consistently strikes blue notes somewhere between Sade and Whitney, but she holds back, well-aware of her unplugged environment. The performance is seriously moving, and yet Ware lets loose a few brief grins and a slight laugh, as if to say, \"All this is quite ridiculous, dont you think?\" And thats Jessie Ware: a devout realist making the most of her pop-star dreams-- and her commitment to both sides of that equation turns Devotion into a uniquely soulful masterclass.\nIf youve half-slept through just one episode of a reality-television singing competition over the last decade, youre probably somewhat privy to Wares trajectory. The one-time theater kid started out as a backup singer before nearly giving up her musical aspirations to be a journalist. But then, thanks to a montage-ready twist of fate, she ended up singing lead on melodic bass producer SBTRKTs 2010 single \"Nervous\", which led to a solo label deal, which led to Ware being forced to take the spotlight. But oftentimes backup singers are off to the side for a reason, and the hard truth is thats where they will be most productive; there are only so many lead roles in the world of pop. Considering her self-described \"boringly sensible\" outlook and the doubt pinging around her brain (\"I had to get past the idea of, like, Who gives a shit about what Im gonna fucking write a song about?\"), Ware sounds more like a supporting player on paper. But then you hear her voice, and any and all limits start to fade into the distance.\nSinging over futuristic electronic tracks like \"Nervous\" and dubstep producer Jokers \"The Vision\", Ware sounded strong, but also somewhat overshadowed by the showy bleeps scurrying around her. Devotion, however, marries her natural gift with throbbing instrumentation that breathes life into every single turn of phrase or sensitive vocal embellishment. The tempos bounce lightly, the drama escalates, the synth-laden ambience cascades like so many postcard waterfalls. This is smoldering music, its smoke bewitching enough to make the original fire more or less irrelevant. \nThe record was largely produced by three men-- Dave Okumu of UK art rockers the Invisible, Bristol electronic upstart Julio Bashmore, and singer-songwriter Kid Harpoon, who co-wrote songs on Florence and the Machines Ceremonials-- each leaving his distinct mark without distracting from the whole. Okumus tracks, especially opener \"Devotion\", are dark and dense, hinting at passions underbelly with each deep bass hit; Bashmores are more airy and upbeat, primed for classy dancefloors worldwide; Kid Harpoon offers the most festival-ready songs-- big hooks, bigger drums-- like \"Wildest Moments\". Tying the disparate sounds together are Okumu, who co-produced and played many instruments on nearly every track, and of course Ware herself, who co-wrote all but one song. Her voice is a marvel throughout, often gaining power by holding back or briefly teasing its scope while staying faithful to melody over melisma. Her words are in tune with this refinement as they chronicle the in-betweenness of love, dismissing easy pleasures for feelings that are more hard-won, confusing, and frightening. \nTake the most classically \"pop\" song here: the weightless \"Sweet Talk\", which modernizes Whitney Houstons late-80s effervescence à la Beyoncés \"Love on Top\". On its face, the track is all endless dimples and mesmerizing lips, but then the verses sink in: \"Dont keep me with the kisses, theres never any there when I need,\" pleads Ware. She knows shes going to fall for the smooth nothings once again, though, and lets the keys try to cover the inevitable regret, which plays out on \"Running\", where Ware starts, \"Your words alone could drive me to a thousand tears.\" The title track, with its foreboding murk, gives whiffs of a seance as Ware asks, \"Ready to love but do you want it enough?/ Can we find a way to bring it back again?\" Given the tracks perfectly rendered storm clouds, you get the impression she already knows the answers. The idea of running comes up often on Devotion, and its clear that Ware isnt interested in the sprints-- when it comes to love, shes angling for a marathon. And she knows marathons can be really fucking tough. \nTalking about her childhood aspirations earlier this year, Ware told me, \"Its so unattainable to be a singer. Id watch Top of the Pops and think I could never do that. And I didnt look like a pop star compared to the people I used to watch on MTV like J.Lo or Destinys Child.\" As a middle-class Jewish girl from South London whos closer to 30 than 20, shes still nothing close to a cookie-cutter R\u0026B breakout. Her success thus far-- and its likely continuation thanks to Devotion-- is a testament to both her talent and budding songwriting skills, as well as the wide-open field that is modern R\u0026B, where a sensitive soul like Frank Ocean can make a star-in-a-box like Chris Brown look about as relevant as a dial-up modem. \"Im just having fun and trying to pretend Im a pop star,\" said Ware, talking about her high-style videos. And while embellishment and theatricality is still a coveted and worthwhile pursuit within the pop realm, the beautiful thing is that, in 2012, Jessie Ware doesnt need to pretend more than anyone else.",

        "article_text": "Ariel Pinks music began its strange journey early in the last decade, as a CD-R lying on the floor of Animal Collectives tour van. Before then, hed been heard by almost no one, despite that hed recorded hundreds of songs, by himself, in what sounded like a windowless dungeon. The quality of those early recordings was poor, but something shone from the murk: Pink became the first artist signed to the bands Paw Tracks label, which reissued his album The Doldrums in 2004. The path of his career since then has been wayward and strange, culminating in the highly professional Before Today in 2010. But there are through-lines. Whether you tuned into his world during the Paw Tracks era or after Before Todays \"Round and Round\" became an indie anthem, you probably sensed an intriguing off-note lurking in the L.A. home-recording savants music. \nIn Pinks hands, the boundless sunshine of 1970s AM pop grows queasy, even malevolent, splitting the difference between a grimace, a smirk, and a smile. Even at its loveliest, his music radiates a mesmerizing sense of bad faith: Pink often incorporates humor into his songs, but its hard to be sure if youre in on the joke. He may express seemingly sincere sentiments in one moment while mocking them in the next. In his most compelling material, these impulses curl around each other until his \"fuck yous\" sound like \"I love you\", and vice versa. \nBefore Today was Ariel Pinks breakout record, a leap to a new stage from his cult beginnings that made his skill as a songwriter and craftsman clear. Free of the lo-fi grit that characterized his Paw Tracks material, you could suddenly hear his uncanny knack for fusing together unlikely parts with no visible seams. Mature Themes, Pinks grittier, gristlier, and funnier follow-up, clarifies that Before Today was not a sign of things to come but rather just a signpost along his unknowable path. The production has hardened, as if Pink has found a midpoint between the warped, warbly sound of his tape releases and what he can now afford. The songs themselves, while still catchy, are often opaque, antisocial, and confounding. The mood of the record veers closer to the melted emotional nowhere of The Doldrums \"Good Kids Make Bad Grown Ups\" or the arch piss-take of Worn Copys \"Artifact\".\nAs a result, some have pegged Mature Themes as an alienating move meant to prune Pinks flock back down to the diehards. But the album is too rich for that straightforward reading. Here, even his puerile sentiments remain generously melodic and lovingly wrought. \"Im not real and I wont call you,\" he croons on the title track, over a melody that climbs upward so gracefully it sounds like hes vandalizing a Shaker hymn. It might be one of the truest lines hes ever sung. But the Elvis Costello-like rising-action of the chorus, which takes the phrase \"I wanted to be good\" up the scale, is an expression of love, pure and simple. \n\"Only in My Dreams\" is another example of his singular songwriting mind: Listen casually and its a Byrdsian pop tune, but sit down at a piano to map out its details, and youll lean back, baffled. If taken apart, no one but Pink would be able to reassemble it. Its this talent that links Pink to past practicioners of outsider music-- R. Stevie Moore, Frank Zappa, Ween. Like those artists, Pink looked at the puzzle pieces of a pop song and figured out jarring new ways they fit together, mingling affection with ironic commentary and intellectual distance. \"Kinski Assassin\" opens with Pink singing nonsense in a stentorian voice not far from a 1930s radio drama: \"Suicide dumplings dropping testicle bombs.\" Then, he chimes in with something silky and romantic: \"Well always have Paris.\" The lyrics dont make any more sense together than the music behind them does, but they glide smoothly into each other, conveying a strong sense of internal coherence. Its the kind of bewitching almost-logic that drives people to endlessly re-watch David Lynchs Mulholland Drive or Inland Empire.\nBut dont look to Pinks lyrics for clues, because they offer few ways to emotionally engage. \"The bad breath of a cross-eyed goat/ Eating children for a Monday morning,\" go the opening lines of \"Driftwood\", intoned with the seriousness of a Druid. On \"Symphony of the Nymph\", he speak-sings the songs title in an exaggerated scientist voice straight out of Thomas Dolbys catalogue over a backing track located somewhere between \"Monster Mash\" and \"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah\". On \"Farewell American Primitive\", the sentiment that comes through most clearly is, \"Fuck it.\" Its moments like these that forcefully remind you: Theres nothing operatic at stake in Pinks music. Its a Chinese finger trap.\nWhen The Village Voice interviewed Pink in 2010, he suggested that hed lost the ability to make music the way he did in his earlier, more prolific days. But Mature Themes is as vital as anything hes ever recorded: Even the throwaway \"Schnitzel Boogie\" fails at being one-dimensional, playing instead like something McCartney might have worked on for the fifth side of the White Album. This seesaw between sincerity and insincerity is the fuel that drives Pinks music. Its the riddle that creates his cult, and its the reason everyone will continue to pay attention to him, no matter how many faces he pulls.",

        "article_text": "Swans are a band that conjure primal forms of power: thunder and lightning, fire and brimstone, master over slave, predator over prey. Their earliest albums came out in the wake of New Yorks no wave scene, a loose, radical contest to see who could make rocknroll sound as ugly as possible while still retaining the rhythms and forms that made it rocknroll. Swans, not central to the scene, countered with the possibility of wiping out rock altogether. The result was something that sounds sort of like monks chanting in front of a jet engine. Frontman Michael Gira once compared being in the band to \"trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget taunting you\"-- a description that could just as easily describe listening to them.\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, Swans went through a goth phase, incorporating sparkly synths, reverb, acoustic guitars, and other signposts of what most people would call \"music.\" But whenever things felt too comfortable, Gira would flatly drop lines like, \"You never say you know me when Im inside you,\" or, \"Im so glad Im better than you are.\" Beauty and ugliness have never been as relevant to their music as the possibility of turning music into a space of confrontation. In the parlance of reality television, Swans arent-- and never have been-- here to make friends.\nAfter a nearly 15-year break during which Gira focused on the dark Americana project Angels of Light, Swans reformed. Since then, theyve released two albums, one studio (2010s My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky) and one live (2012s We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head). \"[The reunion] is not repeating the past,\" Gira said in 2010. He is currently 58 years old and often photographed in a cowboy hat, not smiling. At two hours, The Seer is among the groups longest studio albums and, in a sweeping gesture that only the most confident and egocentric artists can pull off, it manages to expand on their sound while simultaneously summarizing everything theyve ever recorded before.\nThe bands current palette includes a whole trunkload of acoustic instruments: bells, accordion, clarinet, dulcimer, a chorus of bagpipes, and whats referred to cryptically as \"handmade violin thing.\" With the exception of some amplifier distortion, the album puts incredible emphasis on the human bodys capacity to beat the shit out of an instrument in a far more satisfying way than machines ever could. (As an instructive gesture, Gira spends the first four-and-a-half minutes of \"Mother of the World\" panting in rhythm.) Noise has never been as much of a concern in Swans music as pure dissonance; of the way certain combinations of notes literally cause the air to vibrate more violently than others. At its most chaotic, like the climax of \"The Seer\", the band doesnt just sound aggressive, it sounds like its bursting apart.\nThe tracks on The Seer arent songs but incantations, riffs piled on riffs shifting and evolving for as long as half an hour at a time. Sometimes Gira sings; often, theres a zombie-like chorus behind him. One section fades into the next in ways more reminiscent of a soundtrack than an album, and even relatively contained tracks like \"Lunacy\" start and end with winding, immersive passages as the band comes to a boil. Like airplanes, Swans take their taxiing and descent as seriously as their flight.\nStylistically, the album draws a jagged line through a universe of serious, apocalyptic music, from country blues to free jazz to drone and the brutal, hypnotic guitar rock Glenn Branca and Sonic Youth made while Gira was still moaning into the void. A big group of guests are important here. Former Swan Jarboe contributes, as do Karen O, and Ben Frost on my personal favorite credit, \"fire sounds (acoustic and synthetic).\" The bigger the group, the more familial the feeling and the more heightened the illusion is that the music is not coming from inside its players but existing, like a spirit, somewhere outside and between them.\nIn the same way it would be hard to get the full experience of a good movie by only watching half of it, The Seer demands its two hours. To paraphrase something the author Ben Marcus said in a trenchant conversation with Jonathan Franzen about the value of experimental fiction, it is not a record for someone deciding whether or not theyd rather be listening to music or playing paintball. Of course this doesnt mean you need to peel off your own skin while listening to enjoy it. It has made my experience of cleaning the house, for example, feel very, very consequential.\nAt each step of Swans career, theyve been somehow tied to whatever \"dark\" genre was most culturally prominent, but The Seer affirms what they really are and what their legacy will probably be: A psychedelic band that rejects the musical template of psychedelia the 60s gave us. Vision has always been a metaphor for both political counterculture and religious mysticism. Prophets, pulling back the veil, \"seeing through\" things in an interest of revealing what they believe to be the raw, burning truth-- this is what Swans have always been about, and what The Seer seems more explicitly occupied with than anything theyve ever done before.\nGira had come out of art school, and even Swans most mature sounding music is rooted in the kind of catharsis through self-negation that was at the conceptual heart of 70s performance and body art. One piece from his student days involved him being blindfolded and led naked into a roomful of strangers with a tape player strapped to his body, playing a prerecorded confession of his sexual desires. The pieces coordinators had found women willing to do the same. The crux of the piece was Gira and the stranger crawling around in the room until they found each other, at which point, theyd have sex.\nIn the world of Swans, the pain of catharsis is always in service of elevating to some higher plane of being. Granted, most people probably prefer to find this in exercise and not public sex, but when sifting through Swans apparent bleakness, its important to recognize that their goals are and always have been to remind us of the ways extreme states of being, however intense, a unique kind of blessing. One of their live albums was called Feel Good Now, which is as succinct a self-summary as any artist could offer: Later, Swans bluntly suggest, youll be dead.\nIs this music primal? Yes. Intense? Absurdly so. On \"A Piece of the Sky\", Gira sings that \"the sun fucks the dawn.\" Why the sun cant just come out normally is unclear. But theres still room for music like this, music that claws its way unapologetically toward wherever it thinks answers might be hiding. After all, without Icarus and his wings, we might never know how high the sky went or how hot the sun got. For 30 years Swans have challenged the boundaries between beauty and ugliness, music and noise, catharsis and abuse. To borrow a verb from their own violent, polarized world, The Seer is the album that transcends them.",

        "article_text": "\"You want to know me? Well, whats to know?\" asks Jack Tatum on the title track of Wild Nothings Nocturne. The albums subtly addictive nature is such that only after a dozen listens did this anti-revelation strike me as its most revealing lyric. Tatum really does view himself as a facilitator. He drove that point home during our interview last month, debunking any attempts made in the past two years to classify him as a \"personality.\" This seems self-defeating for a guy who works in a style of lovelorn, Anglophilic indie rock that never goes in style because it never really goes out of style, and tends to favor extreme recluses or extroverts for its breakout artists. Fortunately, Nocturne distinguishes itself from the perrennial crowd of dream-pop nostalgists for the same reason Wild Nothings 2010 debut Gemini did: Tatum is simply one of the best songwriters in this field, and Nocturnes significant upgrade in fidelity makes that point more clearly than ever.\nWhether its better than Gemini or its EP follow-up, Golden Haze, only matters in the event you have room for just one Wild Nothing album in your life, and you probably shouldnt limit yourself. Its hard to imagine anyone who dug Gemini jumping ship here-- Nocturne is a richer, comparatively luxurious listening experience, but it doesnt sound flashy or ostentatious. Even while recording with one of Brooklyns classiest sonic interior decorators in Nicolas Vernhes, Tatum granted himself only basic amenities-- live strings, a human drummer, better microphones.\nNocturne is painted with the same colors as Gemini, but the resolution is much higher. When the songs on Gemini wanted to convey vitality or physicality, they were charmingly ramshackle, stuffed with busy drum machines and insistently strummed guitar. If Nocturne wants for anything, its the sense of immediacy that marked highlights such as \"Chinatown\" and \"Summer Holiday\". This record is more about craftsmanship. Lead singles \"Shadow\" and \"Paradise\" feel newly urgent in a holistic way, going places Tatum couldnt access in his Blacksburg dorm room two years ago. \"Shadow\" allows itself brief asides between verses to let those lustrous strings moan and swoon, \"Paradise\" interrupts its glistening downer-disco for an indulgent ambient build-up. The full-bodied sound means the softer side of Nocturne gets fleshier too. Gemini relied on reverb to convey texture and depth, and while theres still plenty on \"Through the Grass\", the rhythmic complexity of the songs delicate, interwoven arrangement plays a bigger role in making it one of the loveliest thing to be done with guitars this year.\nEntire labels and local scenes are dedicated to preserving the era Nocturne evokes-- lacquering the malaised vocals, getting the right reverb plates, and hoping that aesthetic identification is more important than writing melodies that stick. Tatum, however, is a songwriter first who just happens to work in this medium. His vocals are put to the forefront to give the listener a clearly marked place to return, and his melodies are smoothly curved, like a small divot at which the rest of the arrangements can dig deeper. The hopscotch verse melody of \"Shadow\" works in tandem with an insistent, four-note motif doubled on lead guitar and violin. On \"Counting Days\", a simonized harmony serves as the chorus, but the little guitar countermelody that darts around it is the hook. Tatum understands the semantics of this stuff.\nWhich makes it strange that his ambitions as a melodic tunesmith arent matched by his lyrics. Successfully writing like Robert Smith can be just as tricky as doing a decent Morrissey, which becomes clear every time Nocturne crosses an invisible line where a tiny bit of editing would pay off: \"Paradise\" contains the sensible-sounding, yet bafflingly mixed metaphor \"velvet tongue so sweet\", while \"Only Heather\" rhymes first and asks questions later: \"I couldnt explain it/ I wont even try/ She is so lovely she makes me feel high.\"\nOr maybe thats the only kind of lyric that really matters on Nocturne. If theres a Heather in your life, that song might be the centerpiece of your next mix. Or you might just listen to it hoping youll meet a Heather, in which case, Wild Nothing is invested in the concept of wish fulfillment. This is called dream-pop for a reason, and theres no logic for what drives adults to lie out on the grass staring at the sun for hours or write songs about girls with fantastical names like \"Rheya\". Nocturne gives a voice to those feelings, and damn if it isnt lovely to listen to.\n",

        "article_text": "Kieran Hebden first came on the scene in the 1990s as a member of Fridge, a post-rock outfit that to me always looked better on paper than they sounded on record. Whatever you think of his first band, Hebdens subsequent career can be seen as the idea of post-rock done right. His appetite for music, on the evidence presented in his albums, singles, DJ sets, and collaborations, is voracious. But Hebden has a way of transforming and integrating influences rather than channeling them. So if his loose improvised collaborations with drummer Steve Reid captured something of the spirit of the classic late-60s free jazz records on Impulse!, they also managed to carve out a unique and identifiable aesthetic that sounds very much like today. When working with others, like the wooly free-folk unit Sunburned Hand of the Man or the dubstep producer Burial, Hebden knows when to lead and when to get out of the way. But all the while, whatever the context, hes absorbing. And when it comes to his own records as Four Tet, he has a knack for combining sounds from all over and making them his own.\nRounds is the one undisputed Four Tet classic, but all are at least good. Its not unusual for Four Tet records to have a few dull patches, but given Hebdens M.O., thats never a big problem. You expect him to explore a bit, so its okay when once in a while something doesnt quite gel. Ringer, an intriguing EP from 2008 that throbbed with a minimal pulse and revealed a surprisingly austere side to his music, is a good example. It was the kind of record you wanted to inch closer to, because you had the sense there might be more going on beneath the surface than youd initially realized. The follow-up album, There Is Love in You, is the glorious sound of those ideas being drawn into the light.\nThis is the most focused Four Tet album by a huge margin, and for some listeners that could be an issue. Hebden apparently refined this music over the course of a long stint as a resident DJ at the London club Plastic People. Hed play developing tracks in his sets, see how people responded, and return to them armed with this information. And while the result isnt dance music proper, There Is Love in You definitely functions on that plane. This isnt fist-pumping music that toys with the pleasure of pop music, like one of my favorite Four Tet tunes, \"Smile Around the Face\". And its not an album that bowls you over with the density and intricacy of its textures. Instead, its both heady and physical, subtle but powerful music for thinking and moving or ideally doing both at the same time: Its been a while since a brisk walk through the city sounded this good.\nVery early in the 2000s, the corny word \"folktronica\" was sometimes applied to Four Tets style. It never defined him, but the tag was applied because it described his fondness for samples of sounds that seem to be reverberating in a physical space. He sampled jazz cymbals, guitars, gamelan-style percussion, and voices, mixing them in with electronic squiggles and choppy breaks culled from hip-hop. Hebdens fondness for acoustic sounds caused his music to come over as unusually airy and bright. It made you think of daylight rather than the nocturnal crackle of sampled vinyl. Though Love is a very different album from those earlier records, remnants of the sound palette remain, imparting a similar sense of clarity, brightness, and warmth despite its late-night club-bound inspiration.\nThe album begins with a crisp cymbal tap on \"Angel Echoes\" that sounds perfectly live until a quick digital stutter comes a few bars in, and then a clipped female voice, reduced to just syllables but still conveying a strong sense of yearning, begins looping into view. There are bells, a steady midtempo 4/4 kick, and that voice, and thats about it. But \"Angel Echoes\", like most of the record that follows, is strangely moving in spite of its limited toolkit. After it ends abruptly and tumbles into the brilliant \"Love Cry\", a much more drawn-out and darkly shaded tune, it starts to become clear that another inspiration could be in play: the music produced by Hebdens schoolmate, Will Bevan aka Burial.\nThe pair collaborated on an intriguing two-track 12\" last year, and if nothing else, Hebdens consistent return here to the texture and expressive possibilities of vocal fragments forms a clear link. \"Sing\", halfway through the record, is the most affecting and flat-out gorgeous example of the technique, as it laces the propulsive housey rhythmic thrust-- the push and pull of the kick and snare, bits of percussion, a short and repetitive synth motif-- with an alien, genderless voice that curls into a kind of weary howl. The effect reminds me of nothing so much as the \"ah-AH-ah\" vocals that snake through Aphex Twins immortal \"Windowlicker\", and Hebdens processing gives \"Sing\" a similar sense of simultaneous grounding and weird dislocation.\nHebden has studied Aphex Twin carefully, having made his first splash in 1999 when he remixed a track from SAW II for one of Warps 10th Anniversary compilations. Elsewhere on Love, you can find the creative melding of beats and classical minimalism that producers like Richard James and Nobukazu Takemura were exploring in the 90s. An array of metallic percussion pops up, organized into hypnotic grid-like patterns that gradually build and change over the tracks duration. The voice sample in \"Circling\" doesnt appear until two-thirds of the way through the tracks runtime, and it brings with it a cluster of bright electronic tones that call to mind the iconic pulse of Reich/Riley minimalism. The loping, sleepy \"This Unfolds\" has several layers of quietly twinkling sound happening at once, and you can shift your perception to follow along with any one of them or simply let the whole thing wash over you. Though it mostly lays back and doesnt waste any notes, There Is Love in You always has just enough going on to pull you back in any time you feel like relegating it to the background. It works best taken whole, rather than broken into individual tracks.\nWhenever There Is Love in You comes to the closing \"She Just Likes to Fight\", a quietly pretty instrumental built around a straightforward guitar melody, I start thinking of Hebdens early days. Theres a moment at the 2:18 mark where the music pauses for a moment as a tapped guitar harmonic rings out, and it brings me back for a split-second to \"Harmonics\", the acoustic guitar instrumental that is the one Fridge tune I love without reservation. Its such a basic and elemental thing, the overtones of one metal guitar string vibrating in place, but in the right hands it becomes a tool that can be used to deliver a surprising blast of feeling. The simple power of sound is something this guy has understood from the beginning.",

        "article_text": "In March, Animal Collectives Panda Bear (aka Noah Lennox) had his breakout moment with the release of Person Pitch. It was his first solo album that didnt sound like what wed previously heard from Animal Collective; sample-heavy and based on loops, the albums songwriting devices favored expansion and contraction over conventional chord changes. Person Pitch reflected Pandas interest in dance music-- even when it veered toward the angelic pop innocence forever associated with the harmony-drenched hits of the 1960s and 70s. Both the album and its transcendent centerpiece, \"Bros\", are deservedly being widely considered among the years best.\nOn Strawberry Jam, the new album from Animal Collective, its Avey Tares turn. Its not that Strawberry Jam resembles a solo album, or that Avey (aka Dave Portner) seems to dominate to an unusual degree-- Panda Bear is unmistakably present too, along with sound processor Geologist (aka Brian Weitz) and guitarist Deakin (aka Josh Dibb). But the specifics of whos doing what have been shuffled, and the members respective contributions-- including whos singing at any given moment-- arent always easy to single out. The story of this record for me, though, is the strength of Avey Tares voice, and how his singing anchors these songs, invigorates the bands idiosyncratic melodies, and offers a clear portal into Animal Collectives utopian dreamworld.\nAvey Tares tone has never been as aching and pure as Panda Bears, but his is the more versatile instrument. Wild intervallic leaps-- jumping up and down full octaves, or going from a full-throated howl to a piercing shriek-- have long been his trademark, and its something that bugs a lot of people. That makes sense: His vocal style is peculiar, and could easily strike some as affected. But the way he negotiates a song like the fourth track here, \"For Reverend Green\", shows just how well he can adapt his singing to fit the needs of the song.\nOver a repeating guitar delay that sounds a little like the Smiths \"How Soon Is Now?\" and an organ seemingly pulled from the midway of a county fair, Avey follows the contours of \"For Revered Green\"s sing-song melody but never seems bound by it. He explodes with a scream every line or two for emphasis-- not to highlight a word, but to convey the idea of feelings spilling over the edges of the songs expansive container. Its a sound and point-of-view associated now with only one band. A backing of \"whoo-oo-oo\" vocals working in counterpart to the main melody only reinforce how distinctive Animal Collectives sound has become. Here, more than on any record yet, they own that sound completely.\n\"For Reverend Green\" fades into the structurally similar but tonally different \"Fireworks\", arguably forming the greatest back-to-back in the Animal Collectives catalog. \"Fireworks\" is about the pleasure of simple things, but also about how hard they can be to appreciate: \"A sacred night where well watch the fireworks/ The frightened babies poo/ Theyve got two flashing eyes and theyre colored why/ They make me feel that Im only all I see sometimes.\"\nAnimal Collective are never a band I listened to for lyrics-- on those early records, they were pretty hard to make out-- but the words in \"Fireworks\" match perfectly the songs complex mood: Theres a romantic sense of longing, an air of celebration, but also tinges of doubt, loss, and acceptance. That its all rendered so beautifully, with tempered banshee vocals, some spacey dub elements to kick off the middle break, and one of the bands best melodies-- and layered and varied enough to have had two or three good songs built from it-- reveals the bands mastery of complex, experimental pop songcraft.\nThe galloping opener \"Peacebone\" sets the scene; Animal Collective dont seem exactly like a rock band on Strawberry Jam. There are odd sounds of indeterminate origin, and textures vaguely associated with circus music crop up regularly. Here, the melodic buoyancy and junk-shop keyboards stomping along behind Avey Tares voice create a ramshackle backdrop for a story of a monster in a maze, strange fossils in a natural history museum, and plenty of other stuff (when Avey gets rolling, hes pretty verbose).\nThe only thing expected from an Animal Collective record thats never quite delivered on Strawberry Jam is the long, dreamy, droney builder. The albums second half is slightly more abstract than the catchy pop that precedes it, but these moments are tempered, causing the record to feel more focused. \"#1\" opens with a repeating Terry Riley-esque pattern on what sounds like an early-70s synth, but this is a cleaner, simpler sort of experiment for Animal Collective. The lead vocal is pitched down and vaguely eerie, but Pandas bright backing vocals really carry the piece, which seems happy to drift along without going any place in particular. The tracks lack of momentum differentiates it from, say, the songs on the looser second half of Feels, but its got its own vibe and it works.\nThe record culminates with the thunderous \"Cuckoo Cuckoo\", its most explosive track, shifting between lyrical piano bits (not a lot of those on past Animal Collective records) to in-the-red surges of drums, guitar, and noisemakers. And then, after so many great Avey-fronted songs, Strawberry Jam closes with the folk-like \"Derek\", sung by Panda. The song begins with some lightly strummed guitar and water sounds and ends with crashing percussion and a refrain that sounds like a West African pop tune (a quality also present on the Panda-sung \"Chores\") merging with a Phil Spector-produced instrumental single. The sound is huge, but the song is a simple ode to being needed, about the pleasure in caring for something, whether a child or family pet (\"Derek never woke up at night/ And in the morning hes ready to go/ And he never had a voice like you/ To scream when he wanted something\"). In other words, its about accepting responsibility and most of all about growing up, which is something Animal Collective seem to be doing brilliantly, with their creativity and adventurous spirit intact.",

        "article_text": "With their constantly evolving sonic identity, in-your-face vocal mannerisms, and open-ended ideas about what their music might \"mean,\" Animal Collective seem designed to inspire obsessive fans and vociferous detractors in equal measure. Merriweather Post Pavilion, their latest full-length, has been anticipated to an almost ridiculous degree, with blogs and message boards lighting up with each scrap of new information or word of a possible leak. No one whos been looking forward to it should be disappointed. Everything thats defined the band to this point-- all those strands winding through their hugely diverse catalog-- is refined and amplified here.\nSince their inception, Animal Collective have wandered the territorial edges of music, scoping out where boundaries had been erected and looking beyond them. Theyve punctuated perfectly likeable indie rock songs with bleating vocalizations. Theyve seeded pretty instrumentals with irritating noise. Theyve juxtaposed West African rhythms and melodies cribbed from British folk. Theyve stayed on a single chord for 10 minutes. But Merriweather feels like a joyous meeting in a well-earned, middle place-- the result of all their explorations pieced together to create something accessible and complete.\nAlthough it will be tagged as Animal Collectives \"pop\" album, Merriweather Post Pavilion remains drenched in their idiosyncratic sound, a record that no one else could have made. The album is named for a Maryland venue that last year played host to Santana, Sheryl Crow, and John Mayer, but its songs wont be heard on the radio, and besides, Animal Collectives M.O. requires them to exist outside of rigid formats. Nonetheless, theyve found a natural way to integrate the sing-along melodies, sticky hooks, and driving percussion that have long been hallmarks of celebratory popular music.\nAnimal Collectives two vocalists, Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) and Noah Lennox (aka Panda Bear), have never sounded better together, and the way their styles complement each other is the story of the album. On the one hand you have Pandas straightforward melodies, his fuzzy, head-in-the-clouds dreaminess, and his instinctual trawl through pop music history. The tracks that favor his songwriting typically have an underlying sense of drone, with everything moving forward along a line in relation to some subliminal center: They begin, then build, expand, and contract. Tare, meanwhile, tends to work within a more classic pop structure, with clear bridges and snappy choruses, greater harmonic development, and a sharper lyrical focus. Here, he reins in the blurting vocalizations that hes so often used as punctuation (the hardcore faithful might miss this unhinged emoting just a little). Both songwriters are on exactly the same page and, working with sonic spelunker Brian \"Geologist\" Weitz and producer Ben Allen (no Josh \"Deakin\" Dibb this time), theyve found a sumptuous musical background for their most accomplished songs.\nMerriweather is the kind of album on which any song could be someones favorite, but two will likely reign as the choice picks: \"My Girls\" and \"Brother Sport\", both of which leaked prior to the records release, contain the albums most effervescent moments, drawing from the communal energy of the groups astonishing live show. \"My Girls\" grows from a synth-speckled, half-speed intro into a booming electro-pop burner with handclaps and deep bass-- a towering edifice of sound trailed by long wisps of West coast harmonies. The Afro-Brazilian-flavored \"Brother Sport\" moves from one chanted melodic nugget to the next before building to a huge swirl of psychedelic sound that encompasses rave sirens and immersive tribal drums.\nBut these obvious peaks would have less resonance if not for the more subtle moments. The oblong architecture of \"Daily Routine\" hearkens back to the bands less stable earlier days, as it moves appealingly from an awkward organ-based mid-tempo number to a long, droney coda that has the ego-pulverizing bliss of shoegaze. The surging thrust of distortion and drumkick that propels \"Summertime Clothes\" starts with an almost militaristic pomp, but the song soon reaches a place of pure sweetness with a simple chorus hook (\"I want to walk around with you\") that could have come from any point in the last 100 years. Similarly out-of-time sentiments mark \"Bluish\"-- lines like \"Im getting lost in your curls,\" or, \"Some kind of magic in the way youre lying there\"-- and the music has the airy ease of 1970s soft-rock that weirdly winds up a little disconcerting. And then \"Also Frightened\" has the dislocated swoon of first-wave psychedelia, a \"See Emily Play\"-style mediation on the small insanity of childhood softened with billowing layers of voices.\nThe lyrics focus on the body, basic human connection, the need to take care of oneself, the puzzle of existence. Where the churning electronic sound, with its fizzes and echoes and underwater cast, brings to mind altered states and the confusing gap between the familiar and the strange, the words seem like a running commentary on the essential mystery of being alive. Animal Collective dont tell stories, and their music rarely has characters; theres little clever wordplay and fewer money lines youll repeat later on. Rather, the words reinforce the sense of vulnerability that cuts through the music, and wind up being an essential component on an album that oozes confidence from every pore.\nMusic obsessives talk a lot about originality-- whether its important, or why having a new sound should or shouldnt matter. In recent years, some fantastic albums have turned a number of people off for being retreads, which has sparked some interesting discussions. This album, which finds Animal Collective completely owning their unique sound, feels like the crucial next step in that conversation. What theyve constructed here is a new kind of electronic pop-- one which is machine-generated and revels in technology but is also deeply human, never drawing too much attention to its digital nature. Its of the moment and feels new, but its also striking in its immediacy and comes across as friendly and welcoming. Animal Collective have spent the decade following their own path, figuring out what their music is capable of while also working to bring more listeners into their world. On Merriweather Post Pavilion, their commitment has paid off tremendously.",

        "article_text": "At the break in \"Winters Love\", from Animal Collectives feral, sentimental Sung Tongs, when the guitar picks up and Avey Tare and Panda Bears voices flail like children who know theyll never die, it occurs to me that youth isnt always wasted on the young. This is an old cliché, about how kids can never really appreciate the finer aspects of immaturity-- in fact, its their immaturity and naiveté that all the gray adults crave like zombies. Its a childs lack of self-conscience and \"common sense\" that make them holy, just as its an adults knowledge of their own mortality that makes them a little bit dead. However, even if the sickly, aching adults might long for days spent wasting precious time and forgetting precious lessons, most of them wouldnt turn back the clock if given the chance. Youth isnt wasted on the young at all, because only kids on holiday could afford to leave their hearts exposed for so long, to sing as loudly and to take so much for granted. Rather, wisdom is wasted on the old.\nSince their first release, Brooklyns Animal Collective have soundtracked the surreal, manic experience of \"immature\" euphoria. In fact, the Tare/Bear duo responsible for Sung Tongs is the same that issued 2000s Spirit Theyre Gone, Spirit Theyve Vanished, a singular, idiosyncratic take on fairy tale folk and starchild pop. Fairy tales and star-children: These are impressions of The Beyond for imaginative children, and its this mentality that Animal Collective explore and evoke. It might seem whimsical or silly, but only in the sense that these perceptions are the birthrights of all children, and this band have such facility with their musical environment that they manage to turn something primal into something almost timeless. Rather, grace is wasted on the elegant.\nUnlike last years impressive Here Comes the Indian, Sung Tongs opts for folky ambience and late-night, summer camp sing-alongs to carry the weight (or weightlessness) of its strains. Campfire Songs, which followed Here Comes the Indian, suggested a similar kind of sprawling, communal minstrel-craft, but without much of Sung Tongs flair for soaring melody and delicate, buoyant pace. As it happens, the last third of the new record does return to more of an open-ended, exploratory rote, but there it seems less a part of an endless ballad than the come-down from scenes of a jungle almost too fantastic to imagine. And despite its eclecticism and relatively Dadaist leanings, Sung Tongs is a romantic album; romantic in its celebration of innocence and nonsensical shared knowledge, and the sweet, trusted idea that everything will be fine-- as if it hadnt always been.\nMusically, Animal Collective sound more \"pop\" here than they ever have, which is to say most of the songs have clear melodies that beg to be doubled and tripled by you or anyone else who cares to join. In songs like \"Leaf House\", \"Winters Love\" and \"College\", the duo stake a direct claim to the ideal American folk of the Beach Boys and Simon \u0026 Garfunkel, as their harmonies are pure, without suggesting perfection. As Tare and Bear leap over each other in wordless, sparkler-trail counterpoint, I think about the already-gone ambitions of \"Cabinessence\" and Smiley Smile. However, as Brian Wilsons visions were damaged symphonies to god, Animal Collective dont stop down long enough to mire in the dust left behind.\n\"Who Could Win a Rabbit\" revels in a thousand parts of some giant timepiece, as the pair of delirious children slide over screws into a bright green den of gears. The acoustic guitar rings in the start of this race with a fanfare, major chord strum, and just after the chimes cheer in pandemonium, harmony vocals spit out as many syllables as possible to describe who knows what country fair, bread-and-butter game. Sometimes their voices cross, or fly so near each other for long stretches that what seems like intricate polyphony approaches unhinged, acrobatic maneuvering. Above all, a sense of overwhelming happiness at having discovered this strange place abounds.\nElsewhere, the music is more reflective. \"The Softest Voice\" layers clear-toned guitar figures upon each other, as Tare and Bear whisper in harmony above, as if singing to the vision peering back at them from the skin of a backwoods creek. The rustic, secretive manner of their voices and the barely disturbed forest around them suggests that whatever ghosts inhabit these woods are only too happy to oblige a lullaby or two. Likewise, the epic \"Visiting Friends\" gathers in faceless, mutated ghosts (i.e., oddly manipulated vocalizations from the duo) to hover over their dying fire in visage of nothing better than the tops of trees. The constant strumming moves alongside the voices, helping to keep them afloat, but never suggesting they should organize themselves into anything recognizable or predictable. Its windy, and if it rains theyll get wet and continue to play.\nThe ritual dance \"We Tigers\", passing like a pagan baptism for children in war paint, gives way to a trilogy of almost formless ballads, beginning with the erratic hymn \"Mouth Wooed Her\". Here, Animal Collective, no longer satisfied to keep their enthusiasm in check via tribal drums or faintly Brazilian guitar figures, glide through scenes with impressionistic glee. Wordless coos and birdcalls light up the song, and the pair eases into their narrative with wispy, echoed melodies, before running into each other headfirst and pouncing on their guitars like real savages. This is how Sung Tongs communicates; in place of organized chaos, there are chance meetings and reunions, and plenty of celebratory dances and momentary epiphanies. In truth, it may be too much for some people to take, especially if theyre too far removed from this strange environment. For others, its a wonderful place, as these guides know only too well.",

        "article_text": "Midway through 2007, someone asked me the usual question-- the one about which records Id want to take with me to a desert island. The first answer that sprang to mind seemed somehow perverse: Dan Deacons Spiderman of the Rings? I certainly didnt think this was one of the best, most profound, or most life-sustaining records Id ever heard, and it wasnt as if I had some great personal attachment to it; Id only first heard the thing that spring. But it seemed like a lifetime on a desert island would get awfully lonely, and there was something about the album that seemed like a solution to that problem. All the happy massed shouting on a song like \"Wham City\"! Theres plenty of music in the world that conjures up the feeling of crowds, but so much of it feels mob-like and jack-booted, or else its just hero-worship of whoevers posing on the stage in front. Here, on Spiderman, was at least one song where the crowd felt joyous and inviting, like people celebrating the fact of sharing something. Which seemed about as essential, desert-island-wise, as a good sharp knife.\nThe press material for Deacons follow-up, Bromst, talks about the notion of community, and the odd knack Deacon has for evoking it, but Im not so sure thats entirely the point anymore. Sure, Deacons method and sound remain mostly the same here; if you feel like you recognize the chord progressions from Spiderman, theres every chance youre right. The guy trades, after all, in movements that feel simple: He creates a dense rush of sound and then guides it through changes as broad as mountains, these shifts that slide together like blocks and burrow straight into some basic pleasure center deep in the gut of the western scale. Whats different, on Bromst, is the texture and size of it all. Deacon does what most acts do to follow up a small hit: The palette is richer, the samples smoother, the space larger, the programming slightly less buzzy. Actual instruments, the kinds with microphones next to them, abound-- live drums, layers and layers of mallet instruments, a player piano that goes fluttering up and down the scale like its stuck in the lobby of an avant-garde department store.\nAs for community? Deacons still fond of massed shouting, and the overlapping exhortations of electronically processed cartoon vocals-- and all the pounding of toms and ecstatic chanting can leave much of Bromst feeling like the pagan rituals of some woodland filled with chubby, bespectacled Deacon-gnomes.\nBut those small changes manage, strangely enough, to change everything-- including the question of the happy crowd. Spiderman felt grainy, cheap, and primary-colored, an overload of cartoon buzz and bodies dancing. The denser, more sedate sound of Bromst shoots off in the opposite direction; it makes Deacons music feel almost solipsistic, like its ceased to come out of speakers and now lives deep inside your brain. If Spiderman was for dancing on sticky floors, Bromst feels better suited to sleeping, or contemplating the sublime, or anything else that happens mostly between your ears. As it closes, with the gorgeous \"Get Older\"-- building from malfunctioning-modem synths into dreamy sheets of buzz on an achy major-seventh chord-- it actually begins to resemble the heavy, romantic sound of acts like M83, or Pluxus, or shoegazer bands, or the 8-bit \"chiptune\" programmers Deacon shares some kinship with. These are people who make music for getting lost inside your own head.\nWhat makes this change worthwhile is the complexity of Deacons project. Most of us could have been forgiven, after a cursory listen to Spiderman, for not noticing that Deacon was conservatory-trained. But as Bromst rushes steadily by, mostly avoiding the big crowd-pleasing breakdowns and exclamations of its predecessor, the clearer production lets you sink into the minutae of it-- say, the Steve Reich-style rhythms of different mallet or drum patterns overlapping one another. The music becomes something like a natural process: one clean, simple sweep, but built from an insane complexity of detail. And theres enough to un-knot in there to make this a terrific step for Deacon-- out from the sticky basements into a space where he can try to tackle the sublime.",

        "article_text": "I first saw Dan Deacon play live in August 2005, just after I moved to Baltimore. The occasion was a \"bridging-the-gap\" measure at a local loft space to foster unity between the citys art-damaged noise kids and its breakbeat-loving club kids. By the time I arrived, a balding, baby-fattened fellow with a patchy Brillo frizz of beard was unraveling a mess of electronics on a table in the middle of the dancefloor. And once all the plugs were plugged and the jacks were jacked, this man, Dan Deacon, turned himself on.\nWhat came out of the PA was a barrage of cheap-sounding, rainbow-hued, breakcore-tempo electronic noise. It felt like I was hearing my entire childhood record collection of cheerful kiddie 45s sped up on a hotrodded Fisher Price record player. Deacon himself was dancing along with a joyous palsy, singing through a scrim of squeaky effects. In a night where Id shown up wanting dance music, Deacon had completely upended my expectations. He also made me a fan for life. A small handful of the grouches stood with incredulous arms folded across their chests and everyone else proceeded to freak the fuck out, almost as wildly as Deacon himself. Welcome to Baltimore.\n\"Wooody Wooodpecker\", the opening track from Deacons Carpark Records debut Spiderman of the Rings, combines everything awesome-- and potentially alienating-- about Deacons music into 3:50 and sticks it right at the beginning of the record. Here, he loops and distorts the famous cartoon characters convulsive laugh over a sizzling synthesizer crescendo, a needling 12-note keyboard melody, and mechanical percussion that winds to a point where a human drummers tendons would snap. Its like Deacons switch got stuck somewhere between \"irritate\" and \"captivate\" and he decided to never bother fixing it.\nDespite its cacophonous electronic surface, the best of Spiderman of the Rings hits the pleasure centers with a string of great pop singles. \"The Crystal Cat\" could almost be a straight-up surf-rock tune until the moment when Deacons leader-of-the-pack goon croon becomes a grotesquely twisted helium shriek and the drums explode like illegal fireworks. \"Okie Dokie\" is basically \"Wooly Bully\" rewritten with Deacons handmade tone generators and ring modulators.\nSee, Deacon makes \"noise rock\" that taps directly into the great lineage of batshit bubblegum pop. Spideman connects at various points with Kasenetz and Katz, Sam the Sham, happy hardcore and gabba techno, \"Surfin Bird\", the twinkly melodies of an infants mobile (the unexpectedly gorgeous \"Big Milk\"), the Ramones, Koji Kondo (composer-in-residence for the Nintendo Entertainment System), Max Martin, and Daft Punk. On an earlier EP, 2006s Acorn Master, Deacon covered Bobby Darins \"Splish Splash\". That spastic take on a rocknroll classic feels with hindsight like an obvious run up to Spiderman.\nBut theres at least one song on Spiderman that betrays his deep background in more cerebral electronic and avant-garde music. Deacon is a core member of Baltimores Wham City crew-- a Baltimore loft/show space and arts collective-- and the 12-minute \"Wham City\" is this albums centerpiece. In this tribute to his friends and his former home, you can hear hints of all sorts of hypnotic beats, from Neu!s motorik percussion and Kraftwerks synthesizers to Steve Reichs mallets and Terry Rileys keyboards. But as a sing-along-- or chant-along in this case, one of the catchiest of the year-- it also hints at a deep love of old \"Sesame Street\" records and a full collection of \"Muppet Show\" DVDs. Even when Deacon goes epic-- and pays tribute to the hardcore experimental composers he studied in college-- he cant resist the urge to play up to your inner child.\nLike all the kid-friendly stuff that informs his sound-- pop bands, candy ravers, Carl Stalling, noise bands in stupid masks, rap music reduced to a bunch of catchy catch-phrases, and jumping on your bed with friends-- Deacon doesnt care about looking cool. (Rock magazine stylists will never get within 100 feet of the guy.) And if youre down with the cause (Wham City fliers flatly stated \"no jerks\"), Deacon wants you to join him in adding silly joy to a world thats been feeling pretty drab. This fearlessness in the name of trying to make people happy spills onto Spiderman of the Rings like neon poster paint. The album deserves to make song-and-dance man Deacon a superstar, or at least as much of a superstar as the Dean Martin of self-soldered electronics can be.",

        "article_text": "If youve only tuned in for parts of Dirty Projectors decade-long run, its entirely possible that youve viewed bandleader Dave Longstreth and his ever-evolving band line-up as a gimmick. After all, though Longstreth had been releasing music as Dirty Projectors for years, the band finally inched toward a critical mass in 2007 on an album that reinterpreted Black Flags Damaged from memory. The album found Longstreth replacing Rollins gruff bellow with alien, elastic vocals, anchored to the zigs and zags of West African guitar. Two years later, Bitte Orca used a trio of female vocalists-- mainstays Amber Coffman and Angel Deradoorian and newcomer Haley Dekle-- to bait often abstruse arrangements and hard-to-parse lyrics. When Questlove posted a backstage video of the Projectors performing an unplugged \"When the World Comes to an End\" after a \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" appearance, internet commentators concurred that people simply shouldnt be able to sing like that. Between the intercalated harmonies, Longstreths own sometimes-stringent tone, and his counterintuitive approach to guitar, Dirty Projectors occasionally could be reduced into a menagerie of eccentricities-- possible to enjoy, but sometimes difficult to internalize.\nSwing Lo Magellan should help rectify that: The bands least ornate batch of songs to date builds upon Longstreths most direct and identifiable lyrics ever. Which means that Dirty Projectors have upped their emotional and structural accessibility all at once. Culled from a batch of roughly 40 demos, these tunes explore vulnerability and vexation, sweetness and cynicism with more manageable musical complications than ever before. For instance, the gorgeous \"Impregnable Question\" finds the seam between Heart of Gold-era Neil Young and late-1960s Serge Gainsbourg; its a love song between Coffman and Longstreth, her coos helping him to soften his voice above a warm acoustic shuffle. Over handclaps and a ragged, wrapping riff on \"Dance for You\", Longstreth offers one of his most intuitive and immediate hooks. Theres gusto and playfulness here, too, from the way Longstreth clears his very-warped throat before launching into the first verse of opener \"Offspring Are Blank\" to the brilliant decision to record Coffman and Dekle mocking some of Longstreths most impenetrable lyrics toward the end of the irrepressible \"Unto Caesar\". When he sings \"Down the line/ Dead, the martyrs morbid poetry,\" Coffman teasingly answers, \"Uhh, that doesnt make any sense, what you just said.\" You want to be in the room with this band. \nTheres also a folk-song seriousness at work on some of the standouts, especially the tragic \"Just From Chevron\". Structured so that Coffman and Dekle play the part of a Greek chorus while Longstreth sings the dying narrators plight in soliloquy, the song is a fitting one for this year of Woody Guthrie centennial celebrations. Chevron-- or any company, for that matter-- has brainwashed its employee so that, as he lays dying due to their own mechanical failure, he needs his love not to know that he loves her but that his death is worthwhile, because its part of the companys quest to power the world. A devastating fact in a field of general abstraction, its as poignant and profound as anything Dirty Projectors have ever released. The title track works a similar mode, with its buttoned-up rhythm section holding steady alongside lyrics about the clutches of conformity and the liberation of self-reflection. \"In the grid, aware their position,\" Longstreth sings, any possible scorn swallowed in genuine worry. \"Unconcerned with intuition.\"\nThats not to say that all of these arrangements are exactly intuitive. After all, this is still Dirty Projectors, and this is still an album whose first single, \"Gun Has No Trigger\", is an unnerved look at the way things might have been and whose rhythm doesnt shift once. The tricky meter that underpins \"About to Die\" is quintessential Dirty Projectors, as are the two-part harmonies bouncing against Longstreths young-love paranoia. \"Maybe That Was It\" even inches toward psychedelic rock. Longstreths falsetto comes refracted through a web of effects, providing a suitable counter for the Crazy Horse-like stumbling stagger and craggy electric lead. Even the straightforward Dirty Projectors are still a mighty complex unit.\nSwing Lo Magellan is a confident step into the spotlight that neither depends upon public expectations nor shies away from them. Its well-made but certainly not over-produced, idiosyncratic and intricate but very rarely obtuse. But as compelling as these tunes and these performances often are, whats most intriguing about Swing Lo Magellan is the way it suggests that, even after a decade, we still dont know everything about Longstreth or his band. If, in the past, he or they sometimes seemed like a freak show, they come toward Earth just enough here to feel like a proper rock band working in service of songs about love and confusion, anxiety and celebration.\nIn a society of by-the-second news updates and endless information all the time, its strangely reassuring to feel as if a songwriter whos been endlessly interrogated, analyzed, and publicized is still something of a stranger. Longstreth himself seems to serve as the narrator of \"Dance for You\", an ebullient account of an odyssey for a grail that exists but has yet to be found. \"There is an answer,\" reckons Longstreth, his voice rising optimistically over film-score strings. \"I havent found it/ But I will keep dancing until I do.\" This far into a career, thats a good thing not only to hear a songwriter sing but a mantra to hear him create by, too.",

        "article_text": "The biggest tragedy concerning Joanna Newsoms brave, marvelous new album, Ys, would be if everyone sat there listening to it like bored middle-school kids at an amateur Shakespeare production. Newsoms copious, knotty verse is far removed from that of the old poet, but its effect on the crowd is similar: Yes, its hard to follow without the lyric sheet, it takes a few passes to catch the nuances, and all that drama can seem like something of a history lesson. Ys-- pronounced \"ees\" or if you prefer, \"yeesh\"-- is free of the jolts and heads-up hooks we expect from pop music. But while its sure to suffer accusations of empty self-indulgence from some, many will find the contrary truer: Ys offers an endless wealth of substance, teeming with dense, well-mapped beauty.\nTake one example: \"Monkey and Bear\". The songs title characters escape from the farm where theyve lived safely all their lives, before one deviously cons the other into performing for frightened children in order to make a living. Listen to the greed the monkey conveys in degrading, insulting, and controlling the bear, and the tight grip he keeps on her dignity so as not to lose her-- which, of course, by the end, he does. Not bad for what starts out like a nursery rhyme.\nNewsom has said that all five of the songs on this 55-minute album tell true stories. But to find them, youll wade through lines and lines of fantastic allegories and arcane references. Early listeners have latched onto the folky-druid overtones as an excuse to dismiss the record. But nobodys going to reject a record this bold just because Newsom uses the word \"thee\" on occasion, or because she appears in promotional photos wearing a wolf pelt ass-up on her head. What we really cant handle is escapism. We instinctively balk at artists who hunker down in their own worlds-- especially when they force us to guess what theyre thinking.\nFor someone whos been pegged as an \"outsider artist,\" Newsom chose a presentation thats defiantly decorous. Van Dyke Parks orchestration is polite, never intruding on her performance. And her voice, though less shrieky and childlike than on The Milk-Eyed Mender, is still a tough read. The way she creaks, wavers, and punches the lyrics is expressive but never in an obvious way; rather than just illuminating the lyrics, shes almost sticking another code on top of them.\nBut for all the exquisite melodies, arrangements, and production work, Newsoms lyrics make the performance. She crafts elaborate images but drives them with strong actions, and even the densest tangents keep pulling you along. An image like this one, from \"Emily\"--\n\"I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever, in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the skyd been breathing on a mirror\"\n-- is beautiful in its own right, but its also full of movement. Every line of the record conveys some want or desire. This is easy to hear on \"Only Skin\", the most modern (and Kate Bush-like) cut, where she describes \"being a woman\"-- feeling fear, carrying candy like a mother, sharing her lover-- with language as vivid as she uses for a cloudy sky. Her eloquence starts to feel so natural that when she sings a line as blunt as, \"Stay with me for a while/ Thats an awfully real gun\"-- it sticks out like a rend in fabric. And the centerpiece, \"Sawdust and Diamonds\", comes closest to a full release: While the strings take a smoke break, she performs an exhilarating rhapsody where striking verbs-- \"cleft,\" \"shook,\" \"buckle,\" \"crash\"-- support sweeping allusions to death, love, and fear. Her hearts racing, and she doesnt stop it.\nThis isnt a great album because she owns a dog-eared encyclopedia, or because it stands above the cheap rewards or superficial freakiness we expected from her. Its great because Newsom confronts a mountain of conflicting feelings, and sifts through them for every nuance. Its intricate and crammed with information, but its never bookish, and she never sits back in a spell and lets her heart flutter: She swoops into the sky and races across the ground, names every plant and every desire, and never feels less than real. The people who hear this record will split into two crowds: The ones who think its silly and precious, and the ones who, once they hear it, wont be able to live without it.",

        "article_text": "Had the first incarnation of Athens, Ga. metal band Harvey Milk never released anything after its second record, 1994s Courtesy and Good Will Toward Men, the trio of Creston Spiers, Stephen Tanner, and Paul Trudeau could still claim two of the 90s most bizarre records. The groups sound was high cliffs and deep valleys, start/stop monoliths of feedback and distortion, subtle electronics, thunderous drums, and a vocalist who sang like hed devoured Tom Waits soul.\nIn 1997, the trio made one hell of a musical left turn, churning out a relentless riff-rock record, The Pleaser. Harvey Milk had become a bruising bar-band, recording unyielding anthems with clenched fists and clear focus. Frontman Spiers still sounded menacing, but he now fronted a trio with a newfound melodic steel: \"Were having a rocknroll party/ I dont care what you been told/ Its too late to be too old/ Party!\" he sang on \"Rock \u0026 Roll Party Tonite\", sounding like Kurt Cobain fronting Cheap Trick. Though Harvey Milk 2.0 didnt care to replicate the enigmatic menace of its predecessor, they still sounded tough as rust.\nLuckily, Harvey Milk survived beyond those first three records, even if it took them several years to re-enter the studio following The Pleaser. After Trudeau left the band in 1996, Kyle Spence joined for a two-year run. But between 1998 and 2005, with their members scattered between two coasts, no one really heard from the band. Tanner split his time between Portland, Ore., and New York, and Spiers became a music teacher outside of Atlanta. Both drummers picked up work with less memorable acts. Slowly, though, history caught up with Harvey Milk: Longtime friend and fellow Athens expatriate Henry Owings (of Chunklet notoriety) compiled the bands impossible-to-find vinyl output into 2003s The Singles. The Kelly Sessions, released a year later, gathered alternate takes of material from those first two records. Even in death, Harvey Milk got a third chance.\nMostly out of the blue, the band reformed with original drummer Trudeau, releasing 2006s Special Wishes, a half-there recapitulation of that early sonic mass and the rugged rock of The Pleaser. It was, at the least, promising, and enough to further Harvey Milks intrigue. Then, last year, fates collided when skuzzy sonic master Joe Preston-- long of Thrones and formerly of Earth, Melvins, High on Fire, and Sunn 0)))-- joined. Spence again replaced Trudeau on drums, and the new quartet entered his Georgia studio to record the Hydra Head-issued Life...The Best Game in Town, the best executed Harvey Milk album to date, and one of the most accomplished metal records youll hear this year.\nAppropriately, Life runs a bit like a Harvey Milk Greatest Hits: Most everything the bands ever done right-- from its ultra-dynamic, frighteningly agile early work to the Dixieland Motörhead maul of its later work-- falls into place here, the elements freshly recombined. Rendering tension through silence was an early Milk specialty, for instance, but they generally bisected sustained notes of long riffs, creating a sinister shroud of suspense that lifted slowly. But on \"We Destroy the Family\", a cover of a 1982 song by confrontational Los Angeles punks Fear, the band swipes the melody and matricidal lyrics only to rebuild the structure with bass quakes and a long pass of unexpected silence: After two minutes of pounding, things go deathly still. The five stillborn seconds feel like enough time to contemplate retirement plans and stock options. Youll jump when the band wrecks its reverie.\n\"Good Bye Blues\" staggers and stumbles through shifting rhythms, too, a panoply of unpredictable rests causing Spiers slow growl, the guitars long riffs, and Tanners drums to slip past one another. The parts coalesce long enough to flirt with ZZ Top bombast before locking into a downbeat stomp. On \"Skull Socks \u0026 Rope Shoes\" Spiers sounds as pained as he did on those early maniacal masterpieces, except hes fortified now by a howling rock band. Playing bass here, Preston completes a turgid rhythm section, while the guitars crest and collapse in menacing waves.\nThough the core of Harvey Milk 3.0 sounds like a fully functional alloy of its predecessors, three tracks here establish this incarnation as a different act with distinct ideas: Epic opener \"Death Goes to the Winner\" twists lyrics from the Velvet Underground and the Beatles (\"Im Waiting for the Man\" becomes a taunt, \"A Day in the Life\" a suicidal threat) and immolates the guitar solo with pangs of feedback and a speaker-splitting drum throb. \"Roses\", written by Trudeau, shatters any respect for dynamics you might have. \"It becomes cigarette smoke/ It matters little/ Love is not so bad,\" Spiers sings over spare piano notes, his pockmarked croon gilded by harmonies and acoustic guitars. But in the end, its the mid-album \"Motown\" that signals the stretch of this bands canvas. Though it carries the groups signature menace, the hummable song delivers a pop-metal precision thats as accurate with its riffs as it is patient with its delivery. Harvey Milks soul and swagger-- long apparent but often stretched and overdriven-- come together clean at last, the perfect, unpredictable pinnacle for a marvelous maze of a career.",

        "article_text": "Everyone who reads about music has a list of descriptors made meaningless by overuse. \"Hazy\" (rhymes with \"lazy\") is right up there for me, but another that makes me wince though Ive used it myself dozens of times over the years  is \"cinematic.\" Its the term we reach for with instrumental music because movies are where we first learned about the emotional impact of abstract sound. If wed have grown up in the silent era, wed be leaning on different adjectives, but given our level of \"moving image + instrumental music\" saturation, \"cinematic\" is what comes to mind. Fair enough. In the past, the music of Oneohtrix Point Never-- the main project of the busy producer Daniel Lopatin, also of 1980s pop revivalists Ford \u0026 Lopatin-- fit this term. Albums like the Rifts collection and 2010s Returnal had drones and moods and thematic shifts that hinted at some kind of on-screen drama. And Lopatin has said that hes been influenced by film music and would love to work on movie scores. But the new OPN album, Replica, which also happens to be Lopatins best work to date by far, is coming from somewhere else. This is music that exists independently, each track a tiny universe with its own cracked logic.\nA few people have mentioned the Books to me in reference to this album, and the comparison holds water. Its not that Replica sounds anything like the Books-- though it uses tight loops of sampled voices, the voices exist to convey texture rather than language-- but Lopatin shares with them a fresh ear that creates an uncanny sense of wonder in the music. Also like the Books, Replica puts a premium on silence; just as important as all the odd, hard-to-place sounds is the space that frames it. And the combination of unusual textures and all the room, plus the way the music seems unbound to any particular era or aesthetic, makes the whole thing feel playful. The music is by turns dark, ethereal, frightening, and silly, but regardless, it carries in it a feeling of joy. Theres a real sense of discovery here, or possibilities being probed, and that feeling is infectious. You can hear the person making it getting deep into what these sonic elements could mean, and hes bringing us down into this fantastic place with him.\nAside from the intricate production detail, whats most striking about Replica is how well-constructed these tracks are, which is especially impressive given the records brevity (the first nine average less than four minutes each). Each has an arc and the music is constantly changing, but the tracks go into unexpected places. The opening \"Andro\" starts with a lonely, distant synth tone and fuzzy layers of robo-voices before becoming overtaken by noisy samples and, eventually, an explosion of percussion from what sounds like a a digital jungle. \"Sleep Dealer\" starts off like a pop version of a Steve Reich tape piece, zeroing in on percussive phonetic ticks and a loop of a human sigh, but it gradually resolves itself in an almost geometric way, as the relationship between the various samples snaps into focus just before the ending. The title track pulls us out of the machine by starting with a simple piano figure and then folding in bits of synth and finally a buzzing drone, becoming something alien and foreboding after starting so warm and melancholy. Lopatin doesnt just introduce sounds, add loops, and fade out; his pieces move, tripping from one place to somewhere far away over the course of just a few minutes.\nA couple of tracks, like \"Submersible\" and \"Remember\", come closer to the pure synth drone work that marked earlier OPN material, but even these are full of weird surprises, like the distorted and warbly vocal loop at the tail end of \"Remember\" that manages to sound like a field recording of some ancient religious rite, even though its probably something like a processed syllable taken from a life insurance advertisement. \"Remember\", like the album as a whole, feels peculiar and just out of reach, and it makes me realize how hard it is these days to find music imbued with genuine mystery. A huge part of the fun with this record is that these sonic miniatures are truly puzzling even as they remain accessible and highly musical; Replica is \"experimental\" music that also feels open, and somehow, despite coming out of two speakers like all my other records, it manages to feel participatory. I can feel myself filling in space and making connections as I listen.\nMost film music is functional and is meant to reinforce images and amplify whats happening in the story. It is manipulative by design, serving to bend the affect of the viewer in accordance with the directors wishes. These 10 tracks are packed with detail and rich with feeling, but they are also, to a strange degree, devoid of manipulation. Even though theyre uniformly stirring, they dont point you in any direction in particular, and you could see each listener creating his or her own meaning. Instead of pushing, they serve mostly to draw you closer and remind you of the power of sound as sound. Lopatin may have used samples from 1980s commercials to create many of these tracks, but Replica doesnt use nostalgia as an end in itself. This is music that digs deeper and burrows beneath the level of shared associations to discover the sparkling emotional potential of carefully arranged vibrations moving through the air.",

        "article_text": "Songs: Ohia fans, consider this a test of faith. The unstable, minor-key discomfort of Ghost Tropic is long gone, and for the first time, Will Oldham comparisons will be shelved by critics in favor of, god forbid, Bob Seger. The wailing, desperate spirits that plagued Jason Molina through his earlier albums have been banished, mostly; others have come to help him light candles against the darkness, and now \"somethings got to change.\" So hes left the quiet sorrow of Didnt It Rain sucking the diesel fumes of 70s roots-rock by the shoulder of a lonely stretch of highway, consciously emulating his ancestors in a long line of working-class heroes. No matter what you might think of Seger (and pretty much anything would be justified), or the earthy bombast of the time, such simple honesty as Molinas is always in style, and the results are rarely less than excellent.\nIt may simply be the natural progression from the slightly fuller sound of Didnt It Rain, but the overt desire to move on preoccupies Molina. If the last album was a lamentation on finding home in Chicago and the sheer inertia of blue-collar hand-to-mouth, then Magnolia Electric Co. is about finding the strength to move, to grow, and to leave it all behind. \"While youve been busy crying about my past mistakes/ Ive been busy tryin to make a change/ And now Ive made a change,\" is Molinas righteous cry in the early moments of \"Ive Been Riding with the Ghost\"; its this bittersweet sentiment that forms the lingering heart of this album. But then, with the unearthly call of steel pedal strings and the line, \"See, I aint gettin better/ Im only gettin behind,\" the motivation for this need to pick up stakes becomes evident. Its beyond just a noble determination not to succumb to the stagnation of poverty or routine, and when the first hints of an underlying fear crack the façade, the effect transcends the allegorical simplicity of gallant idealism to something far more moving, something almost indescribably human.\nThese themes are echoed even more poignantly on the title-says-it-all opener \"Farewell Transmission\", perhaps the most powerful Songs: Ohia tune yet: \"I will try/ No one ever really tries/ I will be gone/ But not forever.\" This stirring mix of melancholy and hope which Molina consistently finds in his lyrics is swelled to epic levels by the driving alt-country pride and a painfully plaintive refrain. Molinas fixation on the symbolic romanticism of the moon and the darkness might be predictable, but it continues to impress as he segues from heartaching confessional to oblique metaphor in a single breath.\nWhen Magnolia Electric Co. hits its stride in tracks like these, and others like \"Almost Was Good Enough\", it soars over Molinas previous work, but its not an unqualified success. First, although the rotating lineup of Songs: Ohia players recasts familiar faces Jennie Benford as Backing Vocal #1 and the Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma musicians as The Band, Molinas brought along Lawrence Peters and Scout Niblett as Guest Vocalists #1 and #2, respectively, and he turns the reins over to them on \"The Old Black Hen\" and \"Peoria Lunch Box\", to decidedly mixed results. Neither singer seems to connect with the written material, leading to slightly flattened deliveries of what might otherwise have been breathtaking in Molinas broken drawl.\nNiblett does all right for herself, still managing to infuse \"Lunch Box\" with a sort of haunting (if off-key) resignation, but Peters is more problematic. His fatherly, Haggard croon is a little more upbeat than the subject matter, and he sounds an awful lot like someone who should be saving his tears in the beer bottles he keeps in the back of his burnt-out pickup (with his dog) while he drives down dusty country roads, and the thunder rolls, and the lightning... whatever. Depending on ones tolerance for that hardcore country-soaked vibe, hes either extremely impressive or just awful. But either way, hes not Molina, whose voice you bought this disc to hear.\nAside from that, the music doesnt always support the strength of Molinas words, especially in the gratuitously stormy \"John Henry Split My Heart\", but thats less a shot at the compositions than a testament to the wrenching sincerity of the lyrics. It takes a colossal effort to back Molinas candor, and given what a departure this record is for the band, its not surprising that some of the songs get bogged down here and there. Its also not much of a problem; in the end, the more obviously misguided moments will be long forgotten, left in the roadside dust. Magnolia Electric Co. is the sound of change. It may be uncertain whether this is the journey of a man moving towards what he wants to become, or away from what he has been, but its a great ride regardless.",

        "article_text": "You wouldnt play a death knell at a sock hop, would ya? Well, for the past two or three years, that seems to have been the modus operandi of much underground hip-hop. While the beats of the mainstream have become progressively more dance-oriented (and have, in many cases, even incorporated some refreshing experimentalism), the beats of the underground have grown more defiantly straightforward and dance-hostile. Those of us who love a snappy club burner but despise the insipidness of gangsta-bling lyrics have been forced to suck it up and just pray the DJ mixes some Aesop Rock vocals with a little Miami booty crunk.\nBut along comes NYC concept junkie Mike Ladd, the sole perpetrator behind The Majesticons and The Infesticons, two fictitious, rival hip-hop groups whose records have included guest spots from EL-P, Saul Williams, and Priest and Beans of Antipop Consortium. The short story: The Infesticons represent for the underground; The Majesticons rep the mainstream; both are entangled in a perpetual, futuristic battle of wits for the ultimate prize: TOTAL CONTROL OF HIP-HOPS FUTURE. Beauty Party, the latest chapter in this ongoing saga, sees The Majesticons at the height of commercial dominance, having gained notoriety and risen to prominence in previous installments. With so much \"access to excess\", they go mad with their wealth, buying up every material possession imaginable. The joke is that theyve transformed from hard street thugs rocking diamond-encrusted caps into full-blown yuppies.\nIts a great parody, but whats greater is that its not just satire for its own sake; its an excuse for Ladd to pile on platinum-shiny beats, scorching robotic tweak, and aggro-maniacal bling. \"Brains Party\" sees Ladd appropriating the chorus to a Pet Shop Boys song, Puffy-style: \"I got the brains/ You got the looks/ Lets make lots of money/ We are the game/ We are the crooks/ Lets take all their money.\" \"Platinum BlaQue Party\" is a breezed-up, cocoa-buttered R\u0026B; humper: \"Spellman lady friend and lesbian ménage a trois/ With a Wellesley friend, carafes of wine, la-day-da!\" And as usual, an all-star ensemble of guests fills out the record. When El-P, with Can Oxs Vast Aire in tow, rhymes, \"All yall dealing with virtual money/ Shit, I wipe my ass with a twenty\" on \"Suburb Party\", the hilarity is pretty much beyond description.\nBeauty Partys got more one-liners than a night at the Apollo, but beyond the overlying humor, the record drives home a point by making a compelling argument against dogmatism and materialism, and addressing issues of class and value systems, and their impact on hip-hop culture. \"Pirahna Party\" illustrates the devouring conundrum of gentrification: \"We got the stocks/ We got the banks/ You keep the glocks/ We want the docks/ You keep the shanks/ We got the tanks/ We keep the goods/ We subvert the hood/ We buy you out/ Or kick you out/ Tear down your house/ Tear down the blocks/ Those mom and pops.\"\nThrough satire, Ladd has created a perfect amalgamation of underground and mainstream hip-hop. Beauty Party possesses an intelligent, cutting consciousness, and its club-consumability will allow that to reach far more people than if hed just rapped some \"fuck the machine\" rhyme over a dragging, think-rap tempo. That these two seemingly disparate styles work so well together might strike some as a bit ironic, but it proves that if these warring factions can balance their diametrical opposition, they might discover a medium not just happy but straight-up blissful.",

        "article_text": "We all live in pain. Maddening depression is as debilitating as cancer, it's just a question of which you're cursed to lose: Your mind or your body. Xiu Xiu operate on the precept that pain is relative, life is as meaningless as you make it, and that no matter how far you take it-- sex, drugs, rock and roll-- if you're still breathing you could have done more. These new New Romantics also face down the contradiction that tripped up the last generation: As long as you're alive, you're a liar. In the last year of his life, Ian Curtis carefully orchestrated his suicide, penning increasingly resigned, morbid reflections on regret; he designed those lyrics to play from his grave, calling back \"I told you so...\" In making his death as melodramatic and emotionally volatile as possible, Curtis achieved immortality as the late twentieth century's inverted Werther. Do not expect so grandiose a statement from this collection of very sensitive young Americans, weeping over other peoples' graves. Xiu Xiu are plugged into a morbidity only hinted at by lipstick Goths, a theatric, obnoxious self-obsession approaching the club-kids that ran amok in early-90s New York (though thankfully, they've yet to tackle couture). Bassist Cory McCulloch lost his mother some years ago, and was so shaken by it, he put a sticker on Xiu Xiu's first album announcing her death to the world. For anyone suspicious of that move, or as unimpressed by the formless Knife Play LP and Chapel of the Chimes EP-- the latter featuring an appallingly trite rendition of Joy Division's sacrosanct finale \"Ceremony\"-- A Promise delivers an intellectually and emotionally deafening demand for reconsideration. Constantly alternating between a shit-eating (I'm not even getting into the stories that circulate about this deviant) grin and a crazed stare, daring you to dare him to jump, singer Jamie Stewart tries to concoct the perfect lure: A know-it-all pedigree that's broad enough in its drama to draw in kids whose Daddys never understood. There's a bit of misdirection in opening with \"Sad Pony Guerrilla Girl\", a warped take on Simon \u0026 Garfunkel pastiche that eventually breaks into the kind of sadomasochistic no-fi explosion anyone already familiar with Xiu Xiu would expect. I waited for Stewart, but he never screamed \"THIS IS THE BEST VACATION EVER!\" in rejoinder to his disappointed, childish freakout from Knife Play. Without such self-conscious distraction, I was free to appreciate \"Sad Pony Guerrilla Girl\" for its beautiful nylon progression, and much more evocative, directly disturbing lyrics: \"Go on home/ Go home to your kids/ I'm not gonna be quiet and I'm gonna tell the whole block.\" If Todd Solondz hadn't already made Happiness, this song would've made the soundtrack for sure. I didn't expect such captivating material, and I certainly didn't expect \"Apistat Commander\", a quivering opera of existential agony that swells from its breathless introduction to a distorted chorus sounding like the Magnetic Fields covering The Cure's \"100 Years\"; it's one of the most arresting pieces of experimental pop I've come across in years. A Promise is full of juxtaposed moments like this, glimpses of other records, lo-fi adaptations of Bowie's Berlin material or the Geinoh Yamashirogumi gamelan orchestra, best known for their work on the Akira soundtrack (\"Blacks\" pulls gently from the chorus of \"Kaneda\"). Stewart's beautiful, timid whisper is tripped up less often by his only-- but severely-- irritating quality: a present tense passion for checking himself, as if awareness of his ridiculous outbursts should excuse them. Stewart cheapens the record greatly on its only terrible song, \"Walnut House\", where ponderous, forced minimalism is coated with retarded lyrics like \"I am the dumbest bitch on the planet\" and \"My leather Daddy/ Dancing very near/ Like a sweetheart would/ Hurting my butthole like a sweetheart would.\" This kind of standup comic shock material only helps builds a bridge between Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Marilyn Manson, and those guys don't need much help. A Promise generated most of its advance interest thanks to a cover of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\", which, given the group's chaotic pathos and impatience, seems like a daring idea on paper. With the increasing standardization of structure heard on the preceding eight tracks, it's not a huge surprise to find that Stewart and company have crafted a straight, sparsely acoustic version, backed by strings a la the record's opener. He chokes on his paper-thin, wavering vocals, and through the highly compressed microphone, you can hear him writhing uncomfortably in his chair. It's possible \"Sad Pony Guerrilla Girl\"'s subject matter reminded someone in the group of Chapman's folk-rock hybrid, but with his tremulous reading, I wonder if it wasn't a favorite of a friend or relative who's recently passed on. The record's finale, \"Ian Curtis Wishlist\", creates a proper cushion for Xiu Xiu's most melodramatic moment, opening with ominous squelching that gives way to a funereal, two-note soundtrack loop over which Stewart draws from emotions within and around him, shamelessly quoting his friends. He finally screams: \"I will take it too far! The twenty-hundred private loops making up my AAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Ian Curtis-- I can't believe I said it!-- wishlist!\" Such unflinchingly paranoid, manic exclamations are extremely rare, even in the no-rules underground, though I guess you could point to Mecca Normal and Algebra Suicide (Lou Barlow released a similarly maniacal record in 1991, the Mysterious Sentridoh EP). Still, Xiu Xiu are unique in their enjoyment of linear mutilation, and their ability to fuse it with musical experimentation, rather than making it their raison d'\\xEAtre. Jamie Stewart's level of self-obsession is either laughable or erotically voyeuristic; it's a question of how far you're willing to go.",

        "article_text": "Though the lucre here at Pitchfork is plentiful, and I scarcely have time to get one wrecked Lex towed off before a new one is delivered, any promo CD package that falls through my mail slot is doomed. They will all be sold unless they can prove something to me, and quick. I dont need the damn things cluttering my pad. Englabörn, with its pretty little Jon Wozencraft cover, didnt have a prayer. But through a series of accidents, the disc somehow slipped into repeat mode without my realizing it. By the time Id caught the error, the album had played through twice, looping and breathing to life, its leitmotifs orbiting the room in blissful, indolent circles, completely entrancing me. This first solo album from Jóhann Jóhannsson is absolutely beautiful, and it has only become moreso over the past few months, sustaining me for long periods of time when other music just wouldnt do the trick.\nJóhannsson is a member of the Icelandic artist group Kitchen Motors, and aside from the fact that his loose-knit collective has, on at least one occasion, held a concert for cellphones at their local Reykjavik mall, additional information is scarce. So Ill tell you what I know: Taking cues he provided to a stage play by Hávar Sigurjónsson, Jóhannssons Englabörn is composed of music he wrote, as performed by the Eþos String Quartet, with a light gauze of electronic processing applied to it. Although its difficult to ascertain any obvious tweaking in the end result, there is just a slight haze in the air surrounding the sounds, letting the notes levitate and linger.\nIt begins innocuously enough with an AppleTalk voice reciting Latin scribe Catullus poem, \"Odi et Amo\". An intriguing selection of text, the poem addresses the agonizing extremes between devout love and consuming hate. To have this very human poem delivered by a droid tenor reveals all sorts of counterbalances at work: gentle, nuanced music that soundtracked a brutally violent piece of theatre, these acoustic, classical string quartets mixing with digital alchemy, and an ancient voice coursing through the latest in Speak n Spell technology. It somehow balances beautifully, graceful in all its gestures.\nSome of the pieces, like \"Karen býr til Engil\" and \"Eins og Venjulegt Fólk\" recall the similarly melancholy electronic touch that infused the most desolate moments of Radioheads Kid A. With subtle, digital rumbles, poignant glockenspiel, and scarce violin sustainment, a dreadful space surrounds each note, allowing the music to resonate deep inside of you. \"Jói \u0026 Karen\" is exceptionally restrained, the piano moving like droplets off of slowly melting icicles, and the violin breathing warmth from above. The hesitation of each breath and falling bead feels as though it were a Morton Feldman piece condensed to three minutes.\n\"Sálfrædingur\" is the most propulsive of the set, sounding like classic Moondog, with shaking rattles, percolating drums, and stately piano. Its counterpoint is \"Sálfræðingur Deyr\", where the theme is recast with bowed strings, the bass solemn in its slow movements. As the violin shivers against it, Jóhannsson reduces it all to scarcely whispered vibrations. This resonates into the music boxes and small squeaked brass of \"Bad\". \"Ég Átti Gráa Aesku\" recombines the processional percussion from before with the earlier refrains of piano into a more majestic statement, while \"Krókódíll\" recapitulates the downward movement of piano notes of the opening theme, this time with the voice replaced by profound organ drones.\nBy the time of \"Odi et Amo - Bis\", which slows the original recitation to the point of near stasis, each computer tone and bowed note is stilled to the point of absolute zero, the echoes reverberating off of the ice. A rememberance of things past is conjured up as chilling ghosts float in the ether. The emotional strain is apparent with these haunting last moments, though the music remains elegant and elegiac.\nJust as Catullus balanced the extreme emotional opposites of love and hate into a composite whole the greater of its parts, so does Jóhannsson transform these sixteen miniatures into an exquisite listening experience. With the slightest of movements, and in a handful of descending notes, a shivering gulf of sadness is conveyed. Its easy to mention something grandiose, but to fully expound upon this subtly gestured work of music is far more difficult a task. While Englabörn remains out of reach with these words, the music continues to enrich.",

        "article_text": "Forming in 1995 and performing locally around Providence, Rhode Island, Lightning Bolt started out a sloppy but determined art-school trio with a penchant for Skin Graft-style noise-rock and aggressive live shows. It took them two years to get a record out, and when they finally did, it was released in a limited run of 750 copies. Since then, theyve tightened up-- even dropping a member to become a bass/drums duo-- and the live shows which were once simply tenacious have slowly developed into juggernauts, atomic blasts of crystalline fury that send shards of feedback and blistering distortion into anyone who dares witness such savagery in the flesh.\n2001 saw things quickly heating up for Lightning Bolt. Their first nationally released full-length, Ride the Skies, set an impossibly high standard for the band, its tightly wound maelstrom of brutal aggression earning them instant acclaim as among the most punishing new art-rock bands. But, in an unusual parallel with the early bands of 1980s indie rock, the record served mainly as a flier for their brain-damaging stage show, the main attraction. The massive, chunky noise violence that emits from bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale onstage makes for an intensely visceral experience. Chippendales vocals transmit via a contact mic rigged to his mouth inside a weathered, striped ski mask-- which, incidentally, was reduced to a mere shred of its former self by the third time theyd made it to my city last year. Their amps alone are about the height and size of a large-scale yurt, and when theyre turned up all the way, the sound is both hypnotic and physically exhausting. Ride the Skies conveyed that power, earning the band comparisons to Ruins, Boredoms, and even Slayer. The bass came in clumps of crackled abuse, the drums clanged and thwacked with colossal precision, and Chippendales searing, scorched vocal delivery was enough to blow holes clean through the most durable speakers at high volumes.\nSuffice to say, Lightning Bolt have got quite a myth to uphold with their second full-length, Wonderful Rainbow. One might expect this follow-up to either echo Ride the Skies, or diverge from that records distinctive sound and collapse under the weight of its experimentation. I rank Lightning Bolt in my top ten live experiences of all time, and I wasnt quite convinced they werent just a one-trick pony, all flash and magic. Fortunately, Wonderful Rainbow proves superior to its predecessor. Sure, theres less grating, scraping, and stabbing-- three traits that best defined their last LP-- and it may even disappoint those who love Lightning Bolt purely for the carnage. But Wonderful Rainbow delivers what Ride the Skies most lacked: musical diversity. Possibly taking cues from their psychic brethren and frequent tourmates Hella, Lightning Bolt have replaced much of their corrosive noise with throat-grappling melodies that are... actually kind of pretty, in a lacerating, destructive kind of way.\n\"Crown of Storms\", a noodly, chugging prog anthem spattered with muffled hollering, and the quietly chirping title track, show Lightning Bolt dropping some of their incredible audacity to further embrace a clearly awesome sense of humor. The result is something like a more contemporary, less D\u0026D-oriented; Blind Guardian; titanic, complex metal distorted by bass and kickdrum shrapnel. The levity and melody lighten things up considerably, adding more energy and sparkling static, and making the bands traditional fist-throwing freakouts-- like the appropriately titled \"30,000 Monkies\"-- resonate much more on the uptake. Though already known for naked aggression executed with highbrow overtones, Lightning Bolt have gone even artier on us with Wonderful Rainbow, and by balancing their strong-armed aesthetic with unexpected dynamics, theyre now proving themselves as artists with actual range, a band that can deliver beyond the novelty that got people talking; perhaps for the first time on a broad scale, Lightning Bolt will have them listening instead.",

        "article_text": "Leafing through The Complete Pitchfork Works of Rob Mitchum, Year One, Ive noticed that the prime recipient of my venomous ire has been the insidious \"Return of Rock!\" movement spawned by those over-enthusiastic Brits. Chock-full of worthless style-first bands, the whole phenomenon has left me cold from the get-go-- partially because my definition of rock isnt entirely confined to the Nuggets box. Its not that I dont like rock; I just prefer it to be motivated more by passion than retro fetishism.\nExhibit A: My love for Ted Leo, the man who perhaps most embodies any kind of Jesus act rock n roll still has left in it. Hes one of the few guitar slingers Ill still go to bat for, and not just because he hails from the same city-district in which I make my residence. Shunning standard-issue hipster influences like the Velvets and The Stooges in favor of didnt-know-they-were-supposed-to-be-good bands like Thin Lizzy and Dexys Midnight Runners, Leo wields his two specialty instruments-- manic guitar and maniac voice-- with unbridled enthusiasm. Note the lack of studied posturing.\nSo, naturally, Ive been thrilled this year to see one of my favorite incredibly short people enthused over in the pages of Spin and Alternative Press for his new record, Hearts of Oak-- almost as thrilled as I am to write about him personally. But my critical duties compel me to point out that Hearts of Oak is a few steps off the pace of Leos previous album, The Tyranny of Distance, an album so good it makes me want to commit that ultimate indie sin and preach that if Everyone Had Heard It, It Wouldve Been a Nationwide Top 10 for Sure. Freeing Leos sound from the punk constraints of his former band, Chisel, and the experimental dub leanings of his pretty much unlistenable debut Rx/Pharmacists, Tyranny was, put simply, thee rock album of 2001, Strokes and Stripes be damned.\nFor such a drooling fanboy as I, Hearts of Oak almost cant help being a step down, but thankfully, its a nearly imperceptible one. Leo mostly sticks to Tyrannys formula, playing to his strengths with only minor alterations. Most notably, Leo reveals a deeper fascination with all things percussive-- rarely does a track not feature noisemakers or tambourines rattling around somewhere in the mix. The head Pharmacist still pulls combustible pop songs like \"The Anointed One\" and \"2nd Ave., 11 A.M.\" out of every orifice with apparent effortlessness, and each is coated in a Krispy Kreme-like glaze of sale items from Maracas Plus.\nThis approach culminates in the albums centerpiece, \"The Ballad of the Sin Eater\", where the only things not being shaken or hit with sticks are the bassline and Leos vocal cords. Like \"Sympathy for the Devil\" on methamphetamines, Leo speak-sings a tale of traveling the world with American guilt (\"you didnt think they could HATE ya now, didja?!\"). It doesnt pack the wallop of the live version, already known to throw out the backs of the unprepared, but even the recorded version steals my attention away from whatever form of entertainment Im simultasking.\nElsewhere, Leo takes a more traditional route, quaffing liberally from barrels of big riffs and catchy hooks. Not-a-Paula-Cole-parody \"Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone?\" eulogizes The Specials as Leo unhinges his voice like a snake swallowing a rabbit, caterwauling, \"Foo-awoo-awoo-awoo-awoo-LESH!!\" at the unconverted. And through it all, his revolving-door crew of Pharmacists sound anything but transitory, even slipping into a convincing Booker T. \u0026 The MGs groove on the Boston-referencing \"Bridges, Squares\".\nYet, as I said, I still find Hearts of Oak to be a slight sidewalk trip from The Tyranny of Distance, so lets just get my complaints out of the way now, shooting gallery-style. \"Dead Voices\" is the first time Ive ever heard Leos pipes fail him, resonating at an uncomfortable range like someone who started the national anthem in too high a key. Leos assets usually mean he can hold an audience rapt with a solo number, but \"First to Finish, Last to Start\" is marred by an overdubbed guitar solo thats completely oblivious to the chord changes. And yeah, I could do without the whistling in \"The Crane Takes Flight\".\nStill, Hearts of Oak comes out smelling far sweeter than the releases of Leos fellow glossy-mag guitar loyalists. Eschewing pretentious unpretentiousness for unguarded passion, strict 77-82 influences for the classic rock stop on the FM dial, calculated instrumental inadequacy for guitar solos that are less technical flaunting (looking at you, Malkmus) than skillful, noisy exorcisms, Ted Leo makes a sound filled with so much authentic abandon that the British mags probably cant handle it. And that, my friends, is just about the biggest endorsement I can offer.\n ",

        "article_text": "Punk was the future of rock n roll way back in 1969, and Ill wager even money that it still is. Its the sheer \"fuck you\" of it. That doesnt mean aggression, or spiked shoulders, and certainly not the late 70s marketability that came from politicizing it-- just a bands desire to play whatever the hell they want, without regard for anyone who may or may not want to hear it. The Velvets, the NY Dolls, The Ramones, X, Big Black (and the list continues intermittently ad infinitum) were all just raising their middle finger to their audience; the people who saluted back were the keepers.\nBut naturally, punks elements of style were slowly, inexorably co-opted and assimilated into \"markets\" for particular \"sounds,\" finally settling into various media-friendly blocks like new wave and grunge. The punk movement fizzled with the backslide into further genre Balkanization, but that doesnt mean the desire for confrontation has subsided. For twenty years, punk has bided its time, and bands like Liars, Black Dice, and now, Giddy Motors are poised at the starting line of the next big race in rock-- the race to get wherever it is they want to go, and fast.\nMake It Pop is the Motors case study in hellish cacophony; with just guitar, bass, drums, and a little sax (the most underused instrument in rock), Giddy Motors lurch, stomp, and eventually plunge headlong into near-total bedlam. The only constant throughout is Manu Ros flawless percussion; rhythm is the heart of any band, and with drumming this solid, a band would be justified in doing just about anything, period. Not an ounce of that opportunity is wasted, either-- when the Motors throw their act into high gear, the bass clatters with a menace almost unheard since the days of Big Black (not surprising since Nietzschian superman Steve Albini is working the controls), and Gaverick de Vis guitar wails like thunder and lightning, matched only by the orgiastic spasms of his own vocals. Together, the sound is hell on wheels, with a beat that absolutely slaughters.\nIts not until the band slows things down that Make It Pop is discernable as anything more than well-assembled chaos, but finally, the influences start to fall into place: A slightly malicious take on modern free jazz (evidenced most clearly by the intro to \"Bottle Opener\"), rhythmic stretches of post-punk minimalism, and de Vis fire and brimstone chants combine with violently swaying, stabbing melodies, directly conjuring memories of Nick Cave and The Birthday Party (especially on the overwhelming \"Cranium Crux\"). A sneering rap (of sorts) opens \"Sassy\" before it downshifts into a plodding assault of bass and snares, punctuated by the occasional anguished yelp. Here, what is superficially pure chaos starts to make incredible sense.\nAnd then Giddy Motors catch you offguard: \"Venus Medallist\" enters as if your disc-changer had skipped ahead to another record without your realizing it. All the contorted shouts, rumbling bass and dense percussion give way to gently rolling acoustic guitar and gorgeous string swells. The disorientation this track produces is almost palpable-- I spent the first half just waiting for a crash, an explosion, anything. Instead, I ended up having to go back and listen from the beginning to what might actually be the highlight of an already strong album. Beautiful and unexpected, \"Medallist\" is the signature on the Giddy Motors frantic mission statement for the future of rock.",

        "article_text": "Its difficult for me to hear Norwegian music without tying it to ECM Records, the fine art label that has recorded some of the countrys best jazz musicians and brought others from around the world to work with the locals. From the cover photos of winterscapes and frigid oil rigs that look so cold they make your teeth hurt, to the labels signature sound of vast reverb and chill precision, ECM was made for Norway. The label has indulged emotional high notes that would embarrass more straight-laced jazz players, but no matter what happens on an album, authenticity radiates from its musicians independence: The music is framed, not molded. The experiences can be unabashededly rich or pure and still, but they always come directly from the players, who are effectively alone, responding directly to the moment.\nThe Norwegian quartet Supersilent record for Rune Grammofon, but theyre distributed internationally by ECM. In many ways, theyd be the perfect ECM band, though they have an edgier, almost sinister undercurrent thats unlike anything that label has approached. And for all the images they may summon, the band makes music as abstractly as possible: The albums and tracks are numbered, not titled; the personnel arent listed on the cover; and for all the attempts to label them \"jazz,\" \"electronic\" or \"ambient\", the band eschews genres: The musics played so close to the vest that it slips under any classification.\nSupersilent is an electroacoustic ensemble, formed when the free jazz trio Veslefrekk-- Arve Henriksen on trumpet, keyboardist Ståle Storløkken, and Jarle Vespestad on drums-- played a show with producer, live electronics artist and self-described \"audio virus\" Helge Sten (aka Deathprod). That shows success encouraged them to record a three-disc, three-hour set titled 1-3, which was an intense barrage of rhythms and assaulting sprays of electric noise, plus extras, like a monotonous voice reading instruction manuals. They reined it in slightly on the follow-up, 4, and in 2001, they released 5, culled from live recordings that changed the focus to slowly shifting textures and an almost ambient pace. But their latest album, 6, is their most engrossing and tactically varied yet. Its also the most accessible.\nFor music this moody, its surprising how neutral that mood turns out to be. The atmosphere is thick, but the band stays emotionally reserved. The sound is almost stoic; its sonic extremes dont so much as nudge the slow tempo or contemplative tone. A piece may be based on a repeating figure or simple rhythmic pattern, but that repetition comes from improvisation: Everything this group plays, every time, is improvised, and each track is presumably edited from a longer session. More to the point, it never settles: Vespestad never locks down the beat, the ambience never grows static, and they never make a noise just to fill space. You cant treat this as background music without getting distracted by the decisions being made at every second, and although the end result is restrained-- almost weirdly cool, even at its messiest-- it refuses to be anticipated.\nThe electronics largely define Supersilents music: Sten does live manipulations and processing, and, with Storløkken, deploys sounds from the groups many synthesizers-- one of which is built around the sound processing chip of a Commodore 64. These sounds are incredibly varied, seemingly created with both state-of-the-art and harsh, lo-fi equipment. The keyboards crash like waves on \"6.5\", one emitting a howling, piercing noise that rises over a great shifting mass below, while on \"6.1\", the chords are neither bright nor dark, but neutral and stern, like stone chimneys of sound.\nDrummer Vespestad is a formidable improviser and colorist, though he plays with considerable (some would joke \"Scandinavian\") restraint. He shifts expertly around the keyboardists on \"6.1\"; and on the erratic cat-and-mouse game of \"6.3\", Sten and Storløkken chase each other, sneaking more and more quietly until Vespestad abruptly slams down on top of them. But Vespestads jazz drumming comes through on \"6.2\", which emerges as the most strictly jazz-like track: Its similar to the measured pace and dark, giving textures of Miles Davis 70s fusion ballads, which are also an influence on trumpeter Henriksen. Henriksen serves here as the soft voice against his colleagues: His tone sounds breathier and more faltering than Davis, but he also sometimes sings-- wordlessly, in a beautiful, pinched high voice-- and near the end, he even whistles, a lone, aching sound against a gently buzzing texture.\n6 has gentler passages than Supersilents previous albums; on \"6.4\", Stens introduction of a guitar puts the group close to Sigur Rós or Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- two bands the label is gunning for as they convert new listeners abroad. But most post-rock sounds numbingly rigid next to this: Supersilent may go for a big finish but the crescendos can rise suddenly, or appear so roughly and naturally that its obvious that no single player is forcing cues or smoothing out the arc.\nOn those terms, \"6.4\" is both an easy entrance for new listeners and a pinnacle of everything the band strives for. Melodic without any set tune, it gently escalates on Stens guitar and the warm synths, with what sounds like an autoharp interjecting in the background. The almost forlorn sentiments appear as the volume climbs, and even though a big finish seems inevitable, you can hear the band deciding moment by moment how to ascend and when to hit the climax. Every note is demandingly gorgeous, every phrase as solid but irregular as a natural object, and the majesty it achieves comes out jagged, loud and even harsh-- and it comes entirely from the musicians: Its a communication thats fierce, human, and immense.",

        "article_text": "Liz Phair was a grifter. Using sexuality as a weapon, she turned the tables on obsessive boys and set their hearts aflutter with brazen lyrics, from the flagellant lust of \"Flower\" to her dead-to-the-world praise for doin it doggie-style, \"That way we can fuck and watch TV.\" Yet, forgiving a few heartfelt ballads like \"Explain It to Me\", Phair was in many ways a coy tease, partying and watching porn with guys shed never date, despite their lust for her.\nChan Marshall (aka Cat Power) was never such fun, never crude or masculine; shes the opposite fantasy, the porcelain art-school doll whose blissful confusion you could never hold in your hands. Shes the girl that never called you back, that made you lose your cool and leave two messages. Every time you see her on the street, or a mutual friend tells you, \"Yeah, I saw her at Cokies, shes dating the guy from so and so,\" it ruins your weekend.\nThe cagiest of modern songbirds, Chan has a famously fragile ego and skittish countenance. Shes wrestled with the consequences of baring a relentlessly observant soul to the world, and bagged on any number of shows when heckled or simply \"not feeling it.\" What fame she currently enjoys is due in large part to the fallout from those freakouts, the reputation of being \"crazy,\" and its absolute bullshit. The Problem With Music doesnt have as much to do with the influence of corporations or digital piracy as it does the delirious desire to be spat upon or condescended to by seemingly unflappable, fuck-everything rebels, projecting a confidence their sycophantic fans wish they could muster. Kids want to see their dreams onstage-- which used to be harmless-- but cool, cold fantasies about credibility, cash and chaos have given rise to an increasingly cocksure collection of unserious dopes with store-bought sticky-up hair. Its a solid indication that pose is still prose to the uneducated, and that nothing has really changed in fifty years.\nUnlike most celebrities-- evidence her fall 2001 fashion spread in New York magazine-- Chan Marshall is unrecognizable from one photo to the next. One moment shes a giddy fourteen year-old; the next, shes withdrawn, wary and wise, the music worlds Juliette Binoche. Recently, shes Nico. Whether anxiety, insecurity, substance abuse or all three are to blame, few artists have gone through as much physical change without plastic surgery. In person, Marshalls face undulates with each syllable, conveying a vast range of emotions in a single inflection. When shes singing, however, its an entirely different story: Ms. Power is a siren on stage, a shepherdess, gently coaxing words across indefinite miles of memory before tenderly putting them to pasture, or unleashing whatever betrayal they carry in tow. Shes a representative for all manner of loss and regret, and serves us in good stead on You Are Free.\n1998s Moon Pix set the stage for a hugely promising follow-up, but Chan missed the side of that barn: The Covers Record was a dashed off, carefree run through the classics, a placeholder for creativity she was unable to channel. In hindsight, its a good thing she didnt record any new material after the mostly disastrous Moon Pix tour. Theres an overt irony to The Covers Record insofar as Chan hid under them for a few years.\nThose days-- the sad days, the manic, childish days-- seem very long gone, as Cat Power reclaims her history, potential and allure in this collection of impressionist vignettes, hampered by a few flat numbers and some awkwardly totemic (though entirely expected) nods to Joni Mitchell. \"I Dont Blame You\" is one of the latter, Chans pining letter to Kurt Cobain that also serves as a third-person apology to self, the sort of thing addicts and those new to therapy pen on admission. She uses the opening slot as a mostly disconnected salvo, only slipping into this sort of nudity once more, on the brutal \"Names\", which is either a public service announcement against child abuse or an honest recollection of tragedies Chan Marshall witnessed growing up.\n\"He War\" enjoyed most of the advance praise for this album, posted in digital preview form on her record labels website. This pounding centerpiece is second only to PJ Harveys \"Big Exit\" in the canon of Heart tributes, but it carries in tow the stilted tempo and clean electric guitars dominating indie rock since Guided by Voices came on the scene. Beyond nominally decrying the Quixotic male impulse that fuels her oeuvre, \"He War\" underscores how remarkable Marshalls voice is, turning an otherwise pedestrian, technically amateur tune into an assured rock anthem draped in sonorous, shrill wails. The tune proves a worthy successor to the detached, bemused innocence of \"Cross Bones Style\", whose referentially genius video broke Cat Power to a wider audience.\nMarshall scribbles a Crayola-colored, daydreamt recollection of the phony-tough cock-rock that ruled the radios of her youth on \"Free\", a moment of stylistic daring that incorporates a deadened drum machine snare with urgent (think Foreigner here) strumming. Its the sound of a more attuned, sensitive kid finding her way in the dark, and the only song on You Are Free to risk disaster, openly toying with SK-1 keys and a guitar lead unintentionally pinched from the Talking Heads tongue-in-cheek \"Wild Wild Life\". The gamble pays off, and just two songs into the album, its clear that Chans taken its title to heart.\nThe Cat Power weve come to know, love, and predict finally delivers that glistening, trebly rasp on \"Good Woman\", a ballad backed by Dirty Three violinist Warren Ellis, as well as a compressed chorale of soprano vocal doubling. Eddie Vedders presence on You Are Free is both appropriate and gentle given his unmistakable coo. Youll recognize it-- and for anyone still mired in divisive squabbling, his breathy moan could ruin the record-- but the two duets with Vedder are the strongest of too many funereally morose dirges that bind the album.\n\"Speak for Me\" transports anyone who lived through Pavements ascendancy back to the breathless expectancy in advance of Wowee Zowee, something Cat Power also felt: shes covered \"We Dance\" since just after that record came out. The playful backbeat chorus and toy pianos of \"Speak for Me\" are partnered with another throwback, this time to Chans low-fidelity roots. Her cover of Michael Hurleys two-chord country blues number \"Werewolf\" is abbreviated from rambling, epic versions you may have heard in concert, and though its aided by David Campbells string arrangements (reminiscent of Carter Burwells soundtrack work), it could lay in next to anything from Marshalls earlier Myra Lee LP. \"Fool\" makes a perfect counterpoint to \"Werewolf\", in terms of Chans maturation where songwriting, production and subject matter are concerned. Her disdain is getting personal, her subject matter less ephemeral, as she scolds rich Americans driven by wanderlust and entitlement. With haunting harmonies and a teasing pause, the chorus tugs at the heartstrings of twenty-something confusion.\nFor the stunning variety and intrigue of its first eight songs, the second half of You Are Free is spotty, and a draining letdown. As the old adage goes, ten songs is an album, and in this case, fourteen is a few too many. Some of the closing tracks should have been kept back for B-sides; the overwrought, repetitive \"Half of You\" is a less meaningful pastiche than the searing Western blues heard earlier on the record, and \"Maybe Not\" is basically an alternate piano take on \"Fool\".\nChans been playing the frayed Joni Mitchell card in advance of You Are Free, and its starting to wear thin. The two real missteps here are \"Baby Doll\", a too-simple nylon guitar plod, and a fantastic but hiss-coated cover of John Lee Hookers \"Crawlin Black Spider\" (reappropriated as \"Keep on Runnin\", surely as a stab at her former lover, Smogs Bill Callahan). Again, this cover is outstanding on its own merits, but interrupts the album, forestalling the icy chill of its stupendous finale, \"Evolution\".\nThe monotonous, glacial insistence of You Are Frees last track-- Cat Powers proper duet with Eddie Vedder-- is as out of place as its opener, a perfect bookend and resolution to a record that almost effortlessly shifts between incongruous styles. Vedder appears in hushed baritone, nicely meshing with the piano line and allowing Chans tongue-tied, sedated lilt to sit on top. \"Evolution\" is as poetic a retelling of moral apocalypse as youre likely to come by, insofar as it ignores melodramatic conviction and the temporal impulse to wax politic. This is pure Hemingway.\nYou Are Free is full of arresting, serene beauty, but as an album-- as that quantifiable object-- it has composite failings. Sans a handful of lesser inclusions and tributes, the imaginary, shorter version of You Are Free is flawless. An unknown singer would take the apologist underground by storm with a record like this, but fame brings expectation and accountability, and certain people are going to be disappointed for the wrong reasons. You Are Free is not a perfect record, but it contains one, detailing the sound of American regret with a singular voice, scrutinized only because of its owner.\n ",

        "article_text": "Kanye Wests 35-minute super-video, Runaway, peaks with a parade. Fireworks flash while red hoods march through a field. At the center of the spectacle is a huge, pale, cartoonish rendering of Michael Jacksons head. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasys gargantuan \"All of the Lights\" soundtracks the procession, with Kanye pleading, \"Something wrong, I hold my head/ MJ gone, our nigga dead.\" The tribute marks another chapter in Wests ongoing obsession with the King of Pop.\nWests discography contains innumerable references and allusions to Jackson. His first hit as a producer, Jay-Zs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", sampled the Jackson 5s \"I Want You Back\". For many, his first memorable lines as a rapper came during 2003s \"Slow Jamz\": \"She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson.\" And when Wests recent interview with Matt Lauer on the \"Today\" show went awry, he took to Twitter, writing, \"I wish Michael Jackson had twitter!!!!!! Maybe Mike could have explained how the media tried to set him up!!! Its all a fucking set up!!!!\" Like most everything else, Kanye may exaggerate the kinship, but its real. And its never more apparent than on Twisted Fantasy, a blast of surreal pop excess that few artists are capable of creating, or even willing to attempt.To be clear, Kanye West is not Michael Jackson. As he told MTV last month, \"I do have a goal in this lifetime to be the greatest artist of all time, [but] thats very difficult being that I cant dance or sing.\" He ended the thought with a laugh, but you get the impression hes not kidding. Unlike Michael, hes not interested in scrubbing away bits of himself-- his blackness, his candidness-- to appease the masses. And while Jacksons own twisted fantasies of paranoia and betrayal eventually consumed him whole, West is still aware of his illusions, though that mindfulness becomes increasingly unmoored with each newspaper-splashing controversy. The balance is tenuous, but right now its working to his advantage. On Twisted Fantasy, Kanye is crazy enough to truly believe hes the greatest out there. And, about a decade into his career, the hardworking perfectionist has gained the talent on the mic and in the control room to make a startlingly strong case for just that.Kanyes last album, 2008s 808s and Heartbreak, was heavy on the Auto-Tune and stark synths, but relatively light on grandiose ideas. It was a necessary detour that expanded his emotional palette; a bloodletting after a harsh breakup and the passing of his mother that manifests itself in Twisted Fantasys harshest lows. But musically, the new album largely continues where 2007s Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropouts comfort-food sampling and Late Registrations baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly. As a result, the record comes off like a culmination and an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization of his strongest talents and divisive public persona. And since the nerd-superstar rap archetype he popularized has now become commonplace, he leaves it in the dust, taking his style and drama to previously uncharted locales, far away from typical civilization.Hes got a lot on his mind, too. After exiling himself for months following last years infamous Taylor Swift stage bomb, the rapper made some of his first comeback appearances at the headquarters of Facebook and Twitter in late July. Videos of West standing on a table in tailored GQ duds while gesticulating through new rhymes (sans musical accompaniment) quickly made the rounds. The Silicon Valley visits seemed like a stunt, but they were prophetic. Forever an over-sharer, Kanye was looking for an outlet for his latest mirror-born musings. He found that platform with Twitter, and proceeded to dictate his own narrative in 140 character hits. Whether showing off exotic purchases, defending himself against the press, or going on stream-of-consciousness rants, Kanye finally had the middleman-free, instant-gratification platform hed always wanted.Juiced on the direct connection, he began releasing weekly songs for free online, the generosity of which would be moot if the songs didnt deliver. But they did, over and over, eventually building up the same type of superstar goodwill Radiohead pulled off with their pay-what-you-want In Rainbows release plan and Lil Waynes free mixtape barrage leading up to 2008s Tha Carter III. So while Kanye cant sing or dance like Michael, hes making meaningful connections in a fresh, oftentimes (ahem) naked way. \"When I used to finish an album I would be so excited for my mom to hear the final - final!\" he wrote on November 11. \"The final - final is what we used to call the... completed album with all the skits!!! I made songs to please one person... MY MOM!!! I would think... would my my Mom like this song!\"Im not sure which song hes talking about. Because, between July and November, West seemingly decided to make My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy less mom-friendly and more of a hedonistic exploration into a rich and famous American id. At Facebook, he rapped the first verse of what would become album closer \"Lost in the World\", at one point changing Michael Jacksons \"Wanna Be Startin Something\" refrain to, \"Mama-say mama-sah Mama Dondas son,\" referring to his late mother. The familial allusion was left off the album. Another Facebook tune-- a brutally oedipal account called \"Mamas Boyfriend\"-- was also deleted, along with the vintage-Kanye-sounding \"See Me Now\". Such exclusions speak to the albums sharp focus-- to move everything forward while constantly tipping on the brink of frantic instability.\nThis isnt the same resourceful prodigy who made The College Dropout or even the wounded soul behind 808s and Heartbreak. Instead, Kanyes Twisted Fantasy incarnation cherry-picks little things from his previous work and blows them up into something less than sane. The expansive, all-encompassing nature of the album is borne out in its staggering guest list which includes mentors Jay-Z, RZA, and No ID, along with new charges like Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, and Bon Ivers Justin Vernon. The inclusion of Minaj (who contributes the schizoid verse of her life on \"Monster\"), Ross (a guy known for making up his own reality as he goes), and Cudi (whos probably even more wildly self-destructive than Kanye) especially adds to the hallucinatory tone. By the time Chris Rock shows up to provide comic relief during one of the albums bleakest moments, it begins to feel as if Kanye is stage-managing his own award show with enough starpower, shock, and dynamism to flatten the Grammys, the VMAs, and the rest all at once.\nOver the past few months, Kanye has intermittently tried to flush away his rep as a boorish egoist in interviews and on Twitter, which is, fortunately, impossible. Because without his exploding self-worth-- itself a cyclical reaction to the self-doubt so much of his music explores-- there would be no Twisted Fantasy. \"Every superhero needs his theme music,\" he says on \"POWER\", and though hes far from the virtuous paragons of comic book lore, hes no less complex. In his public life, he exhibits vulnerability and invincibility in equal measure, but hes just as apt at villainy-- especially here.\nWith \"Runaway\", he rousingly highlights his own douchebaggery, turning it into a rallying cry for all humanity. Like many of his greatest songs, its funny, sad, and perversely relatable. And while the royal horns and martial drums of \"All of the Lights\" make it sound like the ideal outlet for the most over-the-top boasts imaginable, West instead inhabits the role of an abusive deadbeat desperate to make good on a million blown promises. \"Hell of a Life\" attempts to bend its central credo-- \"no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need\"-- into a noble pursuit. As a woofer-mulching synth line lurks, Kanye justifies his dreams of not sleeping with but marrying a porn star, peaking with the combative taunt, \"How can you say they live they life wrong/ When you never fuck with the lights on.\" Inspired by his two-year relationship with salacious model Amber Rose, the song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. Its a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that cant help but break apart on the very next song.\nThe haunted, Aphex Twin-sampling \"Blame Game\" bottoms out with a verse in which Kanyes voice is sped up, slowed down and stretched out. The effect is almost psychotic, suggesting three or four inner monologues fighting over smashed emotions. Its one of many moments on the record where West manipulates his vocals. Whether funneling some of his best-ever rhymes through a tinny, Strokes-like filter on \"Gorgeous\" or making himself wail like a dying cyborg in the final minutes of \"Runaway\", he uses studio wizardry to draw out his multitudes. Tellingly, though, he doesnt get the last word on the album. That distinction goes to the sobering tones of Gil Scott-Herons 1970 spoken-word piece \"Comment #1\", a stark take on the American fable. \"All I want is a good home and a wife and children and some food to feed them every night,\" says Scott-Heron, bringing the fantasy to a close.\nOn \"POWER\", Kanye raps, \"My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts/ Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child, Im fighting for custody.\" The lines nail another commonality between the rapper and his hero. Like Michael, Kanyes behavior-- from the poorly planned outbursts to the musical brilliance-- is wide-eyed in a way that most 33 year olds have long left behind. That naivety is routinely battered on Twisted Fantasy, yet it survives, better for the wear. With his music and persona both marked by a flawed honesty, Kanyes man-myth dichotomy is at once modern and truly classic. \"I cant be everybodys hero and villain, savior and sinner, Christian and anti Christ!\" he wrote earlier this month. That may be true, but hes more willing than anyone else to try.",

        "article_text": "Just three weeks ago, when Girls announced the release of Broken Dreams Club, they also shared a sprawling, handwritten note penned by frontman Christopher Owens. On stationery flipped upside down, Owens scribbled enthusiastically that this EP was their (timely) way of giving thanks to listeners whove showered the San Francisco duo with love and support since Album, their lemons-to-lemonade debut, which arrived last September. While insisting that his bands latest isnt the sound of them \"all grown up,\" he described the six songs enclosed as a \"LETTER OF INTENT,\" a \"SNAPSHOT OF THE HORIZON,\" and a \"step up\" from its stunning predecessor.\nGirls have grown a lot in the past year. All that time on the road together has provided them with ample opportunity to develop into a tight, fire-breathing band. Thats exactly how they sound here: serious and totally devoted to their craft, despite their image as drug-addled scabs. Albums handmade production values were often overlooked-- bloodshot at just the right moments, polished thoughtfully in others, haunting at every turn. But this time out, bassist/producer Chet \"JR\" White really goes for it, letting every flourish and lick sing without sacrificing any of the strung out, open-armed spirit with which he and Owens take to updating American rocknroll standards. Whether its the whammy bar ripples on its title track, the hot flare of horns in the opener, or even the stereo panning on \"Heartbreaker\", Whites work here frames and accentuates the curves of these songs in ways that elevate them all. Those, too, continue to devastate.\nWe know from interviews and reviews alike that Owens back story is big enough to swallow just about any young band. But because of the connective strength of his songwriting, it never did. Singles like \"Lust for Life\" and \"Hellhole Ratrace\" transcended and outlasted that initial ruckus: The celebration Owens spun from the sadness in them was something that could be shared, even if his past could put him at an almost alien distance. He has a natural command of his hooks and confessionals, a gift thats only acquired more compelling shades with time. Take the clarity in his promise of \"rocknroll, out of control\" on \"Substance\" as just one example, or seconds later, as he coolly announces a guitar solo just before its set loose. Theyre simple enough, but both jump right off the recording. Elsewhere, lines like those of the aforementioned title track still cut straight to marrow. Over lonesome chords and a few distant strips of pedal steel, Owens hangs his head, \"I know you feel like I did, too/ And even though Im close to you/ I cant be what you need/ Because, youre just as lost as me.\" As a frontman, Owens has discovered a swagger that matches the deep reserves of melancholy in his voice.\nThis is still undeniably sad, unsettling music. On flirty opener \"Thee Oh So Protective One\", Owens serenades the insecurities of a teenage girl. \"Hell never know about the times that you cried in your bedroom,\" he croons. \"About the times that you cried in your classroom/ About your mother or your father or the way you got your broken heart.\" Its one of several hearts breaking here, though \"Heartbreaker\" showcases the improvement in songwriting best, Owens and White continuing to take the love song template they adore and skew it to their liking. Everything just clicks: its simple, elegant construction, its velvety feel, the way its hopelessly lonesome vocal hook washes over Owens friendly chord progression. Girls may be only a few releases deep, but those chords sound like theirs alone.\nAnd yet, as much as Broken Dreams Club feels like an improvement upon Album both in songwriting and production, this release is clearly about looking forward. The psychedelic haze of \"Carolina\" is the closest theyve come to sonically uncapping the pills theyve been known to romanticize. Its a wild hybrid of a song thats intent on stretching out, its opening layer of evil, crying guitar taking on heaps of gauze before ultimately vaulting into a rowdy, bar-band outro at about the six-and-a-half minute mark. In that same letter that promised growth and focus, Owens also said something quite striking in thanks. \"All of us have something to say and give and this is what happens when we show a little interest and support in others.\" If Broken Dreams Club is indeed an honest glimpse of whats ahead, it sounds as though Girls have much more to give.",

        "article_text": "\"Fembots have feelings, too.\" When we first heard Robyn sing those words, on a single promoting what would become a three-volume set of mini-LPs all bearing the name Body Talk, it was easy to focus on the Swedish pop singers quirky sense of humor. But on this new full-length edition, \"Fembot\" also reveals itself as a compelling statement of purpose. Playing off contemporary pops age-old diva-as-robot trope and cautioning that fellow droids who \"burn out\" are \"ready for demolition,\" Robyn is a pop star who first and foremost projects a need for emotional connection.\nIf thats Robyns artistic credo, then Body Talk is living, breathing, cybernetic proof. Melding dancehall with bubblegum pop, heartbroken love songs with hilariously catty weirdness, and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms, Body Talk-- which combines the five-song Body Talk Pt. 3 with, outside of Pt. 1s uncommonly wise \"Cry When You Get Older\", the highlights from the first two mini-albums-- is a deeply affecting pop record. Robyn may not have released three full albums this year as first implied, but her first true full-length in five years is one of the years best.\nWhat sets Robyn apart from her contemporaries is the three-dimensional complexity of her character, and all sides are on display here. Theres plenty of dont-fuck-with-me attitude in the icy electro-throb of \"Dont Fucking Tell Me What to Do\", which introduces a shit-talking heroine who may be flawed but wont be anyones pawn. And with production by Diplo, the mock-outrageous Jamaica homage \"Dancehall Queen\" proves shes not kidding. But shes also sensitive enough that, during one of Body Talks most inspired moments-- the soaringly tuneful electro-pop ballad \"Call Your Girlfriend\"-- she tells her boyfriend exactly how to break it off with the other woman to inflict the least emotional damage.\nHowever, the highlight from this Year of Robyn remains the gorgeous \"Dancing on My Own\". Whats especially remarkable is that there was any room for improvement: The track appears here as an amped-up \"radio remix\" with bonus synths giving the lovelorn chorus an extra wallop. But then again, Robyn is a master of re-invention: \"Indestructible\" and \"Hang With Me\" were first released as emotive acoustic ballads, and later given revved-up Eurodisco overhauls that ramped up the intensity without sacrificing an ounce of their bittersweet charm. Those are the versions included here, and both lend further ammunition to Body Talks already military-grade stockpile.\nRobyns willingness to experiment with album conventions may feel like an ingenious gimmick, but theres no artifice to the desire for human connection that underlies her vocal quiver and party-starting kickdrums. She communicates heartbreak so convincingly that some of her most devoted fans actually wonder online about her presumed loneliness. She also attacks the charts from the fringes. She explores the fringes from the charts. She should be universal. So why isnt she? With Body Talk, Robyn ups the ante for pop stars across the radio dial and raises her own chances of appearing on yours. And for all her three-album talk, she never forgets that cardinal rule of showmanship: Always leave them wanting more.",

        "article_text": "Of all the genres that roam the indie rock biosphere, the one that probably gets cut the most slack is power pop, which eschews influences that peaked in the past three decades, moves within a sonic range between the Ramones and Beach Boys, and whose bands are aware theres a loyal audience waiting to lap up their derivative, harmony-laden, verse-chorus-verse songs. Existing against this dire backdrop makes the New Pornographers look even more singular. Its almost unfair, in a way, given that the Pornographers arent so much a band as a Davis Cup team of Canadas finest indie singer-songwriters, captained by veteran Carl Newman. When Newman, Destroyers Dan Bejar, and Neko Case first got together (with, it should be noted, other random Canadians) to record Mass Romantic, it seemed to be a goofy, feverish one-off, like a boozy weekend that accidentally birthed an indie pop classic. When the LP became arguably bigger than any of their individual endeavors, the three reunited for Electric Version, but couldnt keep the momentum rolling, suggesting the projects magic was fleeting.\nTwin Cinema doesnt just rebut that notion, it renders it ludicrous. With more developed ideas than Mass Romantic and a more cohesive sound than Electric Version, its their most consistent, confident, and best album to date. Newman is once again at the wheel for the majority of the LP, furthering the notion that the New Pornographers are just Zumpano with added starpower. But this time Newman folds in the more mature sound he pursued whilst under the name A.C., focusing more on rich, Joe Jackson-style piano than arcade keyboards, and getting a lot of mileage out of the ebow. Newmans characteristic pop gems are present and accounted for (\"Sing Me Spanish Techno\", \"Use It\"), but most thrilling are the moments where he expands his sound, be it the disorienting, cyclical chorus of \"Falling Through Your Clothes\" or the shrilly upper-register, surprisingly funky \"Three or Four\".\nIts a small disappointment that Neko Cases internal vocoder isnt applied to another rave-up, but Newman directs her well through two ballads, the off-kilter \"The Bones of an Idol\" and the wistful \"These Are the Fables\". Even Bejar contributes tracks that actually sound like they were recorded with the rest of the band in the room. \"Jackie, Dressed in Cobras\" may or may not revive the character from his Mass Romantic highlight, but its a perfect integration of Bejars acrid vocals into the more hyper Pornographer sound, the corners softened by Cases Childrens Workshop harmonies and Newmans piano punctuations.\nYet in the upset of the year, its drummer Kurt Dahle who practically steals Twin Cinemas show. On prior NP efforts the drums were almost an afterthought. Here the percussion is pushed to the front of the mix, and Dahles swing and crash put tracks like \"The Jessica Numbers\" and \"The Bleeding Heart Show\" over the top. The eight-armed drumming that fills every corner of \"Use It\", or The Soft Bulletin-esque drum-bash coda to \"These Are the Fables\" allow Newman to continue his indulgence with the Who (reference \"35 in the Shade\" with \"Boris the Spider\"), nicking \"Armenia City in the Sky\" for the more astral portions of \"Stacked Crooked\".\nThe added rhythmic complexity is just one way in which the New Pornographers successfully tweak established formulas and set themselves apart. Sure, at their core, the songs of Twin Cinema have that catchy, melodic something that forces me to reach repeatedly for the p-word, but for Newman \u0026 co., instant hummability isnt the endpoint but the foundation. Whether its weaving in opaque, double-meaning lyrics or sneaking a horn part way deep in the mix, the compositions on Twin Cinema are immediate yet multi-layered. Theyd be great in their own right, but by comparison to the plagiaristic, closed-minded, infinitely repeating world of power pop, its all the more special an accomplishment.",

        "article_text": "Despite biopics like Walk the Line and Ray, musicians lives dont naturally translate to compelling movies. The relentless repetition of touring, the fleeting nature of creativity, the mundane conflicts between bandmates and hangers-on-- none of it seems all that visually or narratively interesting.\nFortunately, in the right hands, that life can make for a powerful album-- like The Stage Names, the fourth full-length from Austin group Okkervil River. This sort of self-reflection should come as no surprise from the band responsible for both \"There Is No Hidden Track\" from 2004s Sleep and Wake-Up Songs EP and especially Black Sheep Boy, an album based loosely on the exploits of doomed folk musician Tim Hardin; what does surprise is how much they can accomplish with this confessionalism, which is at its most potent on opener \"Our Life Is Not a Movie or Maybe\".\nAs frontman Will Sheff howls hysterically about the lack of plot contrivances, epic endings, and dramatic camera angles in daily routine, the band becomes increasingly unhinged and aggressive, careening wildly from pent-up verses to explosive something-like-choruses-- an unexpected turn for an ensemble more associated with brains than brawn. Near the end, it all finally and artfully falls apart, leaving Sheff to close with the clincher about \"a calm clicking, like a pro at his editing suite takes two weeks stitching up some bad movie.\" Life gets two thumbs way, way down.\nInterestingly, Okkervil Rivers career is in the midst of a trajectory that perfectly mirrors a traditional narrative arc. Their first two albums, Stars Too Small to Use and Dont Fall in Love with Everyone You Meet, formed the introduction; Down the River of Golden Dreams was the exposition; and Black Sheep Boy initiated the rising action. The Stage Names, if not the climax itself, at least significantly thickens the plot, seeming just as artistically unsurpassable as Black Sheep Boy did in 2005, and even more emotionally devastating.\nWith his fondness for dizzying wordplay (who else writes in parenthetical asides?) and lyrical ambiguity, Sheff may seem like the ultimate indie pessimist on the rollicking r\u0026b number \"A Hand to Take Hold of the Scene\" or the caustic relationship deconstruction \"Plus Ones\", but actually, hes just a realist who captures scene conventions and rocknroll marginalia even as he sees the void beyond them. The mercurial River sound looser and louder than they did on Black Sheep Boy, especially on the dramatic ebb and flow of \"Title Track\", and the tenderly rootsy \"A Girl in Port\". In fact, Travis Nelsens explosive drumwork and Jonathan Meiburgs backing vocals often lend The Stage Names the immediacy and recklessness of a live recording. Their energetic imprecision-- one of their most commanding features-- coils effortlessly into Sheffs self-reflexive lyrics; few groups can so nimbly or inventively use music as an extension of lyrical themes or vice versa.\nFittingly, The Stage Names ends with \"John Allyn Smith Sails\", a document of failure so complete that the main character cant even succeed in killing himself: \"I was breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail, a fall-down drunk with his tongue torn out and his balls removed,\" Sheff sings, embodying doomed poet John Berryman (his birthname gives the song its title). \"And I knew that my last lines were gone, while, stupidly, I lingered on.\" Berryman seems to be indies new romantic failure-- he also inspired the Hold Steadys \"Stuck Between Stations\". Craig Finn had the Minneapolis connection; Okkervil River essentially rewrite the Beach Boys \"Sloop John B\" as a suicide note, turning the song into a joke so grim its hard not to laugh.\nUltimately, The Stage Names shows how a vastly talented \"mid-level band\" (Sheffs words) sees itself, but theres no bitterness here, just overwhelming self-doubt and perseverance. Despite its density (they fit worlds into just nine songs), the album remains exciting and accessible, albeit highly sobering. Its about the folly of popular music and its attendant lifestyles, but these songs are so good and so moving that they only give us stupid, stubborn hope.",

        "article_text": "Prior to the release of Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, online buzz suggested Spoons sixth record was a grower, a distinction also conferred upon the Austin bands two previous albums, each more experimental (and at times alienating) than its predecessor. That optimistic adjective-- which incorporates both the listeners failure to quickly grasp a record as well as a hope to eventually do so-- feels exceedingly appropriate for Spoon, who have cultivated an intense fan base while continuing to experiment (the frequent comparisons to Wilco are indeed apt in this case).\nA large contingent of Spoons following has come from Britt Daniels continual knack for, as he sang on 1998s \"Metal Detektor\", making \"the sound of getting kicked when youre down.\" If any song were to be the quintessential Spoon pop single, then, the radiant, Jon Brion-produced \"The Underdog\", a Cliffs Notes encapsulation of Spoons earnest compassion for the fucked-over, is it. With a three-piece brass fanfare, \"Underdog\" is a battle cry against succumbing to mediocrity masquerading as a middle finger to the standard-bearers: The lyric \"Get free from the middle man\" could also read: \"Get free from the middle, man.\" Likewise, the slinky \"Dont You Evah\" (a cover of an unreleased song by former tourmates the Natural History) affirms Spoons trend toward emotional trusses for the fairer sex, recalling Gimme Fictions \"They Never Got You\" and Kill the Moonlights \"Dont Let It Get You Down\". A different directive occurs on opener \"Dont Make Me a Target\", however, which revisits the obscurantist personal politicizing that many thought marked Fictions \"My Mathematical Mind\". With a few well-chosen phrases-- \"Here come a man from the star...Beating his drum...Nuclear dicks with their dialect drawls,\" both victim and perpetrator become crystal clear.\nGa Ga travels past in a flash-- at 36 minutes, it returns to the brief runtime that Fiction well surpassed-- but leaves plenty of reasons to revisit. Daniel and drummer Jim Enos tendencies toward studio-based devilry come full-flower here, each listen revealing craftsmen reveling in detail. What in lesser hands could be extra-textual gobbledygook instead feels the product of studio freestyling, something to which the murky mixing-board wizardry of Jamaican dub is an obvious precursor. Penultimate song \"Finer Feelings\" is one bit of proof, its wide-open guitars-- straight from Sandinista!-- augmented with a sampled toast from (Clash collaborator) Mikey Dreads \"Industrial Spy\". With the addition of echoed ambiance from a Brussels fair field recording, \"Feelings\" acquires the aura of a surreal Kingston sound system.\nEarlier, \"Evah\"s introduction dips into the self-referentiality the band flirted with on Fiction, featuring a diced-up, looped Daniel asking Eno to record his studio talkback. Two songs later, all manner of discordance enters and exits the reverb-heavy mix of the appropriately titled \"Eddies Ragga\", which developed from a jam session with Eddie Robert of Daniel-produced Austinites I Love You But Ive Chosen Darkness. Ga Gas most intriguing sonic creation, however, is the song which takes the dub influence in the furthest direction: \"The Ghost of You Lingers\". A return to Moonlights spooky sonic variegation, \"Ghost\"s pounding, echoed piano feels like a merged memory of the jabbed guitar from \"Small Stakes\" with \"Paper Tiger\"s moody expressionism. Daniels unmistakable voice is a distant, gothic wail here, as he mourns his missing love with characteristic jargon: \"We put on a clinic/ If you were here would you calm me down or settle the score.\"\nDaniels gift for non-mawkish romanticism results in both Ga Gas best moments, and three of the best songs the band has yet create. Especially on Girls Can Tell, Spoons always flirted with straight-up blue-eyed soul, and \"You Got Yr Cherry Bomb\" is their full-on take-off of Elvis Costellos Motown M.O. on Get Happy! (perhaps purposefully, then, the albums bonus disc is titled Get Nice!). Backed by an irresistible Holland-Dozier-Holland gospel-pop-stomp, \"Cherry Bomb\" re-imagines the heart/sleeve cliché as a vivid bicep tattoo, as Daniel implores his love to three-point-turn and chill out. Ga Gas real bang happens at its close, however, with the one-two send-off of \"Feelings\" and \"Black Like Me\". The former, which ostensibly documents a Memphis-based isolation, features a handclap-accompanied chorus as energized and unremittingly hopeful as Daniels ever been: \"Sometimes I think that Ill find a love/ One thats gonna change my heart/ Ill find it in Commercial Appeal/ And then this heartachell get chased away.\"\n\"Black\"s melodic melancholy-- backed by a weeping piano/guitar motif that recalls Let it Bleed-- is simply gorgeous. Has Daniel ever written a lyric more crushing in its confused simplicity than \"Im in need of someone to take care of me tonight\"? Rather than attempt to relate with someone whos already taken leave, he splits, and so, apparently, does his mind. During the internalized call-and-response that follows, he appeals: \"All the weird kids up front/ Tell me what you know you want.\" Thus, at the end of his emotional rope, he crosses the fourth wall and reveals the aching coda as a mutually lived performance.\nWith Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Spoon have once again found a gray area between the poles of pop accessibility and untested studio theorizing, modifying a formula that has grown to feel familiar even as it wanders, and refusing to square the circle while doing so. Through whatever process they use, the band has also managed to create yet another wonderfully singular indie rock record, unafraid of unfettered passion or self-sabotage, and which affirms a shrouded, hybrid style as unquestionably theirs. Perhaps it is fitting to refer to Ga Ga, and Spoon albums on the whole, as growers, then, but with a different definition: one that takes into account the bands continual, and continually rewarding, approach to creative maturation.",

        "article_text": "Two months ago, nearly 100 acts played the sixth annual Primavera Sound festival, in Barcelona. Among them were Animal Collective, Deerhoof, Lou Reed, Sleater-Kinney, Television Personalities, Yo La Tengo, and a 29-member pop collective that claim to call the Catalan city home. Of course, Barcelona has had its share of visitors-- from the Romans, Moors, Franks and 1992 Olympians to new Raven-Symone jawn The Cheetah Girls 2: When in Spain-- but this time, it really is just a clever name: Im From Barcelona hail from Jönköping, Sweden. Principal songwriter Emanuel Lundgren is a redhead. \"This one is for you, and for you only,\" he told the crowd at the fest, who were soon chanting like Barça faithful at the Camp Nou.\nLundgrens cajoling conveys an intimacy that has always been essential to indie pop. In the mid-1990s, casually recorded tapes and seven-inch singles made listening to Tullycraft or the Softies feel like a private conversation, while the musics girly prettiness deterred the \"Stairway to Heaven\"-weaned. On early 2006 EP Dont Give Up on Your Dreams, Buddy! and now with debut full-length Let Me Introduce My Friends, Im From Barcelona prefer to imagine grand indie pop symphonies, replacing the tape hiss and squeaky guitars of previous decades with multi-part harmonies, strings, horns, banjo, accordion, and kazoos-- while still scaring off anybody who gets carsick from precious songs about chicken pox and tree houses. Rather than superficial gestures of authenticity, Im From Barcelonas cola-commercial chorale extends an invitation: One of these voices could be yours.\nThe voice at the center of these vivid arrangements is Lundgrens, a matter-of-fact salutation just on the square side from Becks hipster deadpan. With the slightest trace of a Swedish accent, its an everydude delivery well suited for light-hearted songs about everydude stuff like tape recorders, sleeping too late, and uh stamp-collecting; the lyrics are simple, but nearly always manage to find something transcendent in the mundane. Midtempo \"Chicken Pox\" applies the lesson of childhood illness to love: \"Cant have it once youve had it,\" while \"Rec \u0026 Play\" makes its eponymous buttons the center of a multi-voice metaphor about capturing the moment. \"This will be my favorite song,\" Lundgren beams. Fellow Swede and recent Sub Pop signee Loney, Dear lends his falsetto to \"This Boy\", battling Boy Least Likely To-like against maturity: \"Theres always gonna be this little boy inside of me/ And theres always gonna be this little girl inside of me.\"\nThe groups size makes the white-robed hordes of Polyphonic Spree an obvious comparison, but Im From Barcelonas taut songwriting renders their numbers largely incidental-- these songs were meant to be shared by many voices. The multifarious instrumentation comes off as necessary, not schizophrenic, something like what you might expect from Beulah if they were Swedes. And at less than 38 minutes, Let Me Introduce Your Friends is too short for the lavishness to wear thin. In fact, Im From Barcelona are at their best in their long farewells, from the end of modestly utopian \"Treehouse\"-- which impossibly bends and branches off in new directions as the choir basically just repeats, \"I will build a treehouse\"-- to the apparently Swedish-language hidden track. \"We never wanna say goodbye,\" Im From Barcelona cheer on the penultimate song, \"Barcelona Loves You\".\nAnyway, why Barcelona? Why not Barcelona, the la-la chorus, familiar vocal abundance, and slight ska feel all seem to ask on \"Were From Barcelona\", far and away the albums best song. Im From Barcelona explain, in their slightly skewed way: \"Im gonna sing this song with all of my friends/ And were Im from Barcelona/ Love is a feeling that we dont understand/ But were gonna give it to ya.\" Like \"Treehouse\", its about a \"perfect place,\" but the choice of place itself may as well be arbitrary-- just, Barcelona, man, all right? Pop music, particularly the indie variety, has always been about belonging, yet there is always so much conflict over who belongs where. Im From Barcelona are the band that wrote the song that could make Israel and Hezbollah get along-- dont these folks realize were all from Barcelona? We bring them love! Next up, global warming.",

        "article_text": "The element of surprise is gone from the mash-up. Hollertronix and 2 Many DJs mastered the technique, made it a staple of their sets, and next, everyone on the block was mix-matching hip-hop to electro and indie rock. The idea that two songs blender-ized can recombine to create something wholly new is thrilling in theory, but the execution is usually sloppy or samey, either simply aligning two similar beat structures or pairing up two completely disparate tracks for the slapstick novelty of a jokey title.\nPittsburgh native Greg Gillis (Girl Talk) absolutely detonates the notions of mash-up on his third album, the violently joyous Night Ripper. Rather than squeeze two songs that sorta make sense together into a small box, Gillis crams six or eight or 14 or 20 songs into frenetic rows, slicing fragments off 1980s pop, Dirty South rap, booty bass, and grunge, among countless other genres. Then he pieces together the voracious music fans dream: a hulking hyper-mix designed to make you dance, wear out predictable ideas, and defy hopeless record-reviewing.\nNight Ripper doesnt stretch the boundaries of mash-ups because there were no boundaries to begin with. As an illegal art form, its surprising no one came along with an idea like this sooner. Still, its doubtful theyd have the sturdy, meticulous hand that Gillis flaunts here. The records pacing is astonishing-- with more than 150 sample sources (all thanked in the liner notes), it ricochets from Top 40 hits to obscure gems and back again like a cool breeze, clocking in at less than 42 minutes. The sampling is pure precision, slotting razor-thin (but highly recognizable) guitar stabs on top of blaring synths on top of anthemic rap couplets and so on, all at breakneck speed.\nPart of the fun of listening is trying to figure out the source of each fragment used on these tracks. Familiar as they may be, youll never place every sample. But at the risk of getting sucked into Gillis name-game vortex, an example speaks to the power. \"Smash Your Head\" glides into the siren keyboards of Lil Waynes \"Fireman\" less than a minute in, then abruptly shifts into the crushingly dense riffs of Nirvanas \"Scentless Apprentice\" while Young Jeezy spits the familiar flames of \"Soul Survivor\", before it all tumbles into a Pharcyde-Elton John-Biggie somersault. On \"Minute by Minute\", Gillis even slots Neutral Milk Hotels \"Holland, 1945\" up next to Juelz Santanas \"There It Go (The Whisper Song)\". There are no ties, other than the miracle of chopping and looping.\nDue to its overwhelming number of unlicensed sources, Night Ripper is practically begging for court drama. In the event of litigation, Gillis label has armed themselves with a Fair Use argument, citing artists rights to liberally sample in the creation of new works. Whether thatll hold any water in a courtroom remains to be seen, but for listeners its an afterthought. Some may dock him points for lack of originality, but Gillis schizophrenic attitude toward pop music is so novel its impossible to stay mad at. Time will tell whether its still fresh in 12 months, when the very recent samples (M.I.A., Gwen Stefani, Webbie) lose their chic appeal next to Smokey Robinson, the Pixies, and Public Enemy-- but for 2006, Night Ripper is the soundtrack of the summer.",

        "article_text": "In January, Pitchforks Brent DiCrescenzo dissected a gathering interest in the sound and style of girl-group music, the early 1960s genre derided as frivolous and disposable and eventually overshadowed by British Invasion pop. Brent correctly pegged Brighton, Englands the Pipettes as leading lights in a new wave of Brill Building-inspired indie pop but guessed that the seven-piece band-- three female singers along with four shadowy male musicians known as \"the Cassettes\"-- would be \"unlikely to match\" early single \"I Like a Boy in Uniform (School Uniform)\".\nHappily, Brent was mistaken, as three subsequent singles, \"Dirty Mind\", \"Your Kisses Are Wasted on Me\", and \"Pull Shapes\"-- each an improvement on its predecessor-- have demonstrated. All three recent A-sides, plus a handful of other previously released tracks, now provide the bulk of debut album We Are the Pipettes. The album therefore doesnt maintain the bands forward momentum for those of us who have been collecting 45s and mp3s for the past year, but its a giddy encapsulation of the best from a group enchantingly embracing both longstanding pop roots and a contemporary musical culture characterized by collisions between past and present and/or by seemingly incompatible musical styles.\nOn We Are the Pipettes the bands synchronized winks and nods and finger waggles to patriarchal 60s girl-group music are not so much retro as they are post-retro, the product of an age in which progression in pop music has all but been replaced by cultivation and fusion. The Pipettes carefully constructed look-- polka-dot dresses, choreographed dances-- and promise to reclaim music from its post-Beatles devotion to ideas of authorship, technique, and \"worthiness\" are meant to frame them as out-of-step throwbacks, but thankfully their album instead recalls the lo-fi wall of sound and communal spirit of fellow indie block party bands the Go! Team, Im From Barcelona, and U.S.E. That distinction makes the difference between karaoke and creating something that sounds unabashedly Now, as all great pop should.\nThe twist is meant to be that these three are sexually aggressive, have read their French feminism, own some riot grrrl records, and have distinct, unique personalities in a sort of Spice Girls way (you could call them Desperate Housewife Pipette, Sexy Librarian Pipette, and Mod Pipette). And while these three shrug off suitors, prefer one-night stands, and love a dirty mind, thats hardly a distinctive quality: Smart, sassy girls asserting their individuality and sexuality have been Page One of the female-voiced chart pop playbook for years.\nNo, the twist isnt that these are girl-group songs as performed by post-ERA females-- its that theyre girl-group songs as performed by three singers who are, well, no longer girls. If Brent and others are lamenting that We Are the Pipettes doesnt contain the outstanding single \"I Like a Boy In Uniform (School Uniform)\", a reason for its exclusion could potentially be found in its parenthetical title-- its meant to be voiced by teenagers. We Are the Pipettes contains a few references to schooldays-- the central metaphor of \"ABC\", in which the girls feel cockblocked by book learning; the backstory to the cautionary bad-girl tale \"Judy\" (tellingly, two of the oldest songs here). But the bulk of the record is clearly about and by carefree young adults-- away from their parents disapproving eyes, experienced enough in both love and loss that neither cuts as deeply as it once did, and enjoying feeling young and alive and free.\nAnd while the consequences and theatricality of girl-group songs are, therefore, toned down here, so too is the music. While We Are the Pipettes often swells and soars, thanks to production from Gareth Parton (the Go! Team, Futureheads), it doesnt come near the symphonic grandeur of the best of 60s girl pop. At its best, however, these pocket-sized songs still burst with verve and vitality, mixing heart-pumping melodies with carefree, almost conversational vocals. Along with the previously issued A-sides, former flip \"Because Its Not Love (But Its a Feeling)\" and new tracks \"Sex\", \"Why Did You Stay?\", and the disarmingly tender and direct closer \"I Love You\" ensure that the group steers clear of the cul de sac of revivalism.\nIn the end, We Are the Pipettes is a modern indie pop album, and a classic one at that. Like the initial twee and p!o!p! kid movements, it embraces an unhip element of the past, understands that indie pop-- even in its tiny, homemade guise-- is a mix of escapist fantasy and big gestures doubling as private conversations, and is unabashedly girly. Its a welcome reclamation of indie pop as the work of bright kids with more ideas than money at a time when the genres reigning kings, Belle and Sebastian and the Decemberists, are embracing theater-sized, 1970s-aping rock.\nThat the Pipettes are doing Shangri-Las impersonations on stage is almost a moot point. The necessity and charm of the Pipettes could have just as easily manifested itself had they framed their approach around replicating any other dormant indie pop totem. (Voxtrot, the Clientele, and Camera Obscura already have, respectively, shambolic jangle-pop, reverb-soaked expressionism, and Northern Soul down; the world now needs 21st century versions of yé-yé girl music and Field Mice-like acoustic pop.) Ideally, in this case the group wont get lost in the slipstream between being too pop for indie fans and too indie for pop fans, because theres a lot here for both camps to love.",

        "article_text": "Janelle Monáe opens her second album the same way she did her 2010 debut: with a sumptuously recorded studio orchestra tossing off flourishes with abandon. When the smoke clears, the first full song features a guest vocal from...Prince. Monáe is not the kind of entertainer who takes prisoners; she operates at the locus of generosity where \"generous\" shades subtly into \"aggressive.\" The song is called \"Givin Em What They Love\", but the feeling is a little more \"take you home and make you like it.\"\nThe facts of Monáes emergence have occasionally made it difficult to embrace her music: She arrived so thoroughly anointed by so many key figures in the entertainment industry that it has sometimes felt pointless to try and touch her. At the heart of her ornate, impressive music, a hint of chilliness kept us at arms-length; she was a conqueror, undoubtedly, but maybe she glossed over the whole \"winning the hearts of the people\" thing.\nWith The Electric Lady, she finds a way to give us more of herself. Together with her tight-knit Wondaland collaborators-- Kellindo Parker, a magnificent guitarist who singlehandedly gooses several songs into transcendence; her college friends Nate “Rocket” Wonder and Chuck Lightning, and Roman GianArthur-- Monáe supervises and synthesizes a parade of golden touchstones (Sly, Stevie, Marvin) into a show-stopping display of force and talent. And at the heart of it, she embeds some of the most personal pain shes allowed to leak into her music.\nMany of her lyrics here telegraph a desire to break away, to \"find a way to freak out,\" as she puts it on \"Dance Apocalyptic\", which is the closest the album comes to an immediate calling card like \"Tightrope\". The album is overall looser and more physical than its predecessor, more concerned with dancing, sex, love, and abandon. \"I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade,\" she sings, in a creamy mid-register, on the moonlit Miguel duet \"Primetime\". The song rides a cerebral whine into an \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" glide, with a \"Purple Rain\" solo cascading over the top like an MGM waterfall.\nThe emotional core of the album, and its unique loneliness, derives from how Monáe both fails and succeeds to connect. She wants to scream and dream, shes found a way to freak out. The most pleading passages on Electric Lady-- gorgeously tender soul ballads like \"Its Code\" and \"Cant Live Without Your Love\"-- feature some of her most emotionally bare, strikingly abject singing. But for all of the sex-positive, queer-friendly utopianism of her music (one between-song skit advertises a \"bouncing electro booty contest\"; on the title track, she pictures \"all the birds and the bees dancing with the freaks in the trees\"; and on the Erykah Badu-featuring \"Q.U.E.E.N.\", she asks playfully, \"Is it weird to like the way she wears her tights?\"), her music has always been about the the exhilaration coming from the sensation of total control.\nAttention to detail is nothing new for the admittedly obsessive Monáe, but man, there are some knockout details here: the rusty poking bedspring of a guitar that powers \"Q.U.E.E.N.\"; the percussion loops on \"Electric Lady\"; the manic clean-toned jazz guitar skittering behind the vocal breakdown on \"Ghetto Woman\". The strings carry some of the most heart-tugging melodies, and the most beautiful moments come when songs melt from an amped-up funk groove into a glimmering, soul-revue orchestra, like \"We Were Rock and Roll\", \"Give Em What You Love\", and \"Q.U.E.E.N\". Gorgeous soul ballads like \"Cant Live Without Your Love\" are built on the kind of rich, finely managed melodies and jazzy modulations that havent been the sound of the radio since the late 70s.\nTaken as a whole, The Electric Lady is a convincing argument for the virtues of micromanagement, but some of the most powerful, tender moments come from acknowledging  limits. On \"Sally Ride,\" she admits defeat, of sorts, declaring shes \"packing my spacesuit, and Im taking my shit up to the moon.\" On \"Victory,\" Monáe offers, \"Ill just keep singing until the pain goes,\" and theres something humbly stoic in her voice. Shes not singing to exorcise pain, which will hang around until its good and ready to go, shes just passing the time until it does doing the thing she does best.",

        "article_text": "To understand where San Franciscos Dodos are coming from, just check the weekend itinerary from their most recent visit to L.A. On a Friday, they did a campus show for USC students; but when a miscommunication foiled their next days plan to play at the Smell-- the venue at the epicenter of the local scene-- they ended up joining a bill with Thee Oh Sees and the Crystal Antlers at a birthday party at the Silverlake Lounge, an intimate, cozy space where you cant see a thing if youre more than five feet from the stage. Its within those coordinates (campus-quad pop, art-punk, and communal, lo-fi folk) that their Frenchkiss debut Visiter exists; an acoustic-and-percussion duo at their core, Dodos manage to hit with a full-band force thats even more pronounced in their astounding live sets.\nOn Visiter, Dodos guitarist Meric Long alternates between fingerpicking and breakneck strumming while playing in confounding alternate tunings. Logan Kroebers clattering, locomotive percussion (which includes shoes outfitted with tambourines) is every bit a lead instrument as Longs guitar, and a big reason the bands music has garnered comparisons to the less abstract moments of Animal Collective and the output of other new-primitivist bands like High Places and Yeasayer.\nThe first quarter of Visiter marries those impulses with fantastic results. The banjo playing and female harmonies on opener \"Walking\" echo Michigan-era Sufjan, but the connection ends at Longs stridently confident vocal delivery. That song immediately segues into the maniacal \"Red \u0026 Purple\", a bewilderingly worded love song accompanied by a toy piano and fuzzy bass. And after the brief \"Eyelids\" comes \"Fools\", which has been bouncing around the web in some form for months, and is fast becoming the Dodos signature tune-- although it may soon be eclipsed by the rollicking, Feelies-esque \"Jodi\".\nFrom that point on, Visiter alternates between longer, more improvisatory material and near-interludes, which can leave a slightly spotty impression on its first few listens. With more exposure, the record reveals the celebratory acoustics of Led Zeppelin III or a more song-oriented take on tourmates Akron/Family. Playing with infectious fervor, Long runs through tricky blues-boxing and molten slide riffs on the galloping \"Paint the Rust\" and the second half of the epic \"Joes Waltz\".\nVisiters second half is anchored by \"The Season\" and \"God?\", two massive shapeshifters that help define the record. Long and Kroeber here dont seem wedded to power duo minimalism-- and its intriguing to wonder how they could incorporate their backgrounds in metal, African Ewe drumming, and gamelan beyond a sense of rhythmic intensity. These possibilities could also make more streamlined, Magnetic Fields-like numbers \"Winter\" and \"Undeclared\" seem vanilla by comparison to some, but by making room for both, Visiter ends up being one of the most welcoming (and welcome) records of 2008 so far.",

        "article_text": "Growing up in rural Louisiana and then later on a farm in Missouri, Julianna Barwick was a preachers daughter at a church whose organ got very little use. \"We would always sing a cappella,\" she explained in an interview a few years ago, \"And instead of instruments we would clap or sing in rhythmic rounds.\" A curious kid and a bit of a loner, Barwick showed a precocious fascination with the human voice. Her hobbies included harmonizing with random sounds, making up songs about whatever she was doing at the moment, and singing long, loud notes in hollowed-out spaces like parking garages and inside the trunk of a giant tree just to see what the echo would sound like. \"It sounds kinda psycho, I know,\" she admitted in our interview, but sometimes \"I would sing to myself and get so lost in it that I would cry.\"\nActually, it doesn’t sound that crazy; it’s very easy to become lost in the music that Barwick now makes as an adult. Over the span of her career, from her imaginative 2006 debut LP Sanguine up through 2011s dazzling breakthrough The Magic Place (the name is a nod to that aforementioned giant tree trunk, where shed unwittingly discovered reverb), Barwicks gradually refined a process that is at once inventive and incredibly simple. She sings short, reverb-drenched, often wordless vocal fragments into a loop station (though she made the loops on the painstakingly lo-fi Sanguine using just a guitar pedal) and layers them into luminous compositions that feel like the aural equivalent of an airplane ride through a cloud. Toweringly sublime yet invitingly human, her music has an uncanny power to transform whatever space its played in. It can make a cramped apartment feel like a high-ceilinged cathedral, or-- when she plays in one-- an actual cathedral feel like a gear-cluttered basement show.\nFollowing the warm reception of The Magic Place, Barwicks approach has often been compared to ambient pioneers like Steve Reich and Brian Eno or the conceptual vocal artist Meredith Monk, but something about her music remains approachable and deeply personal—more intuitive than academic. Even as Barwicks songs become as polished and ambitious as those on her third full-length album, Nepenthe, they’ve managed to retain a certain playfulness and an openness to the process of discovery. It deserves mention among the best and most artful ambient music being made today, but Barwick’s work still feels like the realization of a dream left over from childhood, made by someone downright giddy that she has finally figured out a way to sing a round song with herself.\nSanguine, the 2009 EP Florine and The Magic Place all conveyed a sense of serenity found in solitude, which is maybe why her collaborations with other artists have been such a mixed bag. Her records with Ikue Mori (for RVNG’s FRKWYS series) and Helado Negro (as the duo OMBRE) have been solid, but a 2011 remix EP (featuring versions of Magic Place songs reworked by the likes of Diplo, Lunice and Prince Rama) basically just underscored how beside the point it is to remix a Julianna Barwick song. Her music is so pure and reliant on moments of quiet that another artists’ presence often overwhelms. So Nepenthe was a potentially risky move: It marks the first time she’s worked with other artists on one of her solo albums. And we’re not exactly talking anonymous session guys here: she recorded it with Sigur Rós collaborator Alex Somers (members of múm and the string quartet Amiina also contribute) at Sundlaugin, the band’s famed Icelandic “swimming pool studio.” (As a kid Barwick probably couldn’t have even imagined what sort of natural reverb you can get out of an abandoned swimming pool.)\nThankfully, Nepenthe sounds like a step forward for Barwick, a noticeable expansion in scope that still honors the sensibility that made her early records so unique. Somers’ lush production gives her music a larger and crisper depth of field, making it that much easier to get lost in its many overlapping folds. The structures of some of her tracks have become more complex: The billowing “The Harbinger” finds drama in the movement from crescendos to moments of quiet and back again, while the misty incantation “One Half” feels (true to its title) like a seamless fusion of two separate arcs. (For once, there’s even discernable lyrics in that song, but their purpose is purely phonetic, like words spoken in a strange dream.) But even in its most epic moments, one of Nepenthe’s greatest virtues is restraint. Given free reign in one of the most spectacular studios imaginable, Barwick didn’t go all kid-in-a-candy-store on us here. Nepenthe is a modest evolution-- the work of an artist growing, smartly, to scale rather than adding on needless bells and whistles or pushing prematurely past her limits.\nIt’s also more emotionally complex than her past work. The Magic Place was a slice of pure, unfiltered bliss, but the songs on Nepenthe ache and yearn. Album opener “Offing” hovers like thick fog over a remote pond, while Amiina’s strings drone and growl ominously throughout “Pyrrhic”-- these songs are still ethereal, but they’re stormier clouds than Barwick’s conjured before. On a few tracks, Róbert Sturla Reynisson from múm plays a guitar that, true to his post-rock pedigree, sounds more like a tiny spaceship or the noises made by a comfortingly unthreatening alien. But it’s Amiina’s presence that’s particularly harmonious with Barwick’s overall aesthetic. Theyre creative with the sounds they get out of stringed instruments, which allows Barwick to use them in a way that says something more complex than “[insert orchestral grandeur here].” They often feel like an extension of her own voice. “Waving to You”, the muted, palliative finale, fits in so well with Barwick’s vibe that it took me a few listens to realize it’s the only song on the album without vocals.\nBarwick claims she went to Iceland with nothing written ahead of time. This is how she’s always worked, from her childhood experiments up to The Magic Place-- tapping into the vibrations of the present, and turning them into something that is somehow both enduring and impermanent. You sense feelings of longing and unease all over Nepenthe, which makes it a less blissful place to spend time than her previous album. But that also makes it a much more cathartic listen, and perhaps a more rewarding one. ",

        "article_text": "The first thing you notice is that Bill Callahan is in no hurry. On \"The Sing\", the ballad that opens his warm, weary new album, Dream River, words roll by like cloud formations on a calm day: \"Drinking…while sleeping…strangers…unknowingly…keep me company.\" And afterwards theres a pause as the line hovers there, like something hanging above the doorway into the records peculiar, intimate universe. In the past, Callahan has compared songwriting to an act of carpentry (\"Theres this huge block of silence and you carve little bits out of it by making sound\"), but never before has one of his records embodied that feeling so richly. Each line on Dream River forms so slowly and deliberately its like were watching him whittle it out of oak.\nCall it naturalism, polluted with the occasional puff of bleak humor. From his earliest days recording as Smog, Callahan has always been consumed by the natural world. To him, nature is often a taunt, a provocation, a reminder of the smallness of human life. Although he is among musics most astute observers of human truth and absurdity, in a Bill Callahan song, being a person is often a wry, cosmic joke. The sky can broadcast all the violently beautiful hues of, oh, say, a late-summer sunset, and whats the best we can do? \"Late Night With David Letterman\" (on Apocalypses \"America!\") and radio interviews with Donald Sutherland (on Dream Rivers \"Winter Road\") and-- its always implied, with a meta-chuckle-- Bill Callahan records.\nSince 2007s Woke on a Whaleheart, the first record released under his own name, Callahan has moved counterclockwise to the rest of the worlds spin. As life has become crowded with text, Callahan has, with each record, become more laconic. As people have grown (ostensibly) more connected, Callahans records have increasingly embraced feelings of isolation. Those early Smog records, with their aggressive textures and anarchic sneers, thrashed in opposition to the outside world. Now Callahan sings like someone blissfully oblivious to its churn. \"I set my watch against the city clock,\" he sang on the opening track of his stunning 2011 record Apocalypse, chuckling with faint surprise. \"It was way off.\"\nA quiet masterpiece, Apocalypse seemed like a culmination of Callahans career so far, but it also had a feeling of finality to it. On Dream River, though, the aesthetically restless Callahan has found a few new mountains to climb. He challenged himself to make a more subdued record where the only percussion comes from hand drums and brushes, but he’s challenging himself thematically, too. Dream River finds Callahan tackling a question that has haunted his music for decades: What happens if the guy who once declared, \"Alone in my room I feel like such a part of the community\" makes a moving, occasionally honest-to-god romantic record about the power of human connection?\nThat line comes from \"Ex-Con\", a song found on Smogs 1997 album Red Apple Falls, and its striking to consider how much has changed in the years since. Callahans baritone has lowered about an octave; he used to sing through his nose but now his voice (a much richer and more resonant instrument) seems to come direct from the murkiest depths of his lungs. His arrangements have also grown more sparse, and on all fronts he’s learned how to say more with less. It’s one of many paradoxes in Callahan’s music, that in abandoning a method of singing more traditionally considered “expressive,” hes actually learned how to express more. His delivery is animated by the subtlety of tiny gestures, which is why although there are maybe a total of three words on Dream River that a third-grader would stumble over, its musings still feel profound. “The Sing” boasts one of the album’s most undeniably quotable lines-- “The only words I’ve said today are ‘beer’/ And ‘thank you’”-- but the real joy comes from hearing him mutter, “Beer” and “Thank you” a couple of times afterwards, each time intoning it with an almost imperceptible change in tone. Somehow, each “beer” contains multitudes. \nCallahans learned to use negative space so well that theres even poetry in the pauses. Take \"Summer Painter\", an instant addition to his canon of great songs; for what else can be said of a song that begins, “I painted names on boats…/ For a summer” and then unfurls, glacially, like an elliptical yarn spun by a leathery old shanty-dweller who has, without question, seen some shit. Callahan’s learned how to use his voice like a camera (\"When the hurricane hit some found it suspicious/ That I’d just since left the frame\"), and here he’s shooting a wryly funny mock-epic. “Rich man’s folly and poor man’s dream,” he sings, and then pauses for effect, “I painted these.” It’s a masterful little zoom-out, and it only heightens the sense that Callahan’s playing director here, a feeling furthered by guitarist Matt Kinsey’s torrential freak-out when a storm rolls in.\nThe grandeur, though, is short-lived, and that’s the most profound and affecting thing about Dream River. At its core, this is a record about accepting and even embracing the smallness of human life, and how difficult that can be, given our damnably innate sense of adventure, ambition, and restlessness. For at least four minutes, though, Callahan finds peace and stillness in the form of “Small Plane”. The song is a quiet miracle; an afternoon epiphany told in dream logic and simple language to no one, because his only companion is taking a nap. And yet, what a perfect moment to take stock of things: “I really am a lucky man/ Flying this small plane.” It’s a testament to simplicity, or maybe just the power of his wistful, prismatic delivery, that a songwriter once known for his delight in intricate wordplay has never sung more stirring words than these.\nTo call Dream River “content” or “serene” feels wrong, because there’s still a pang of longing to it. But in all of this albums searching, it does bring back one hopeful find: that maybe the closest we can come to the thrill of wilderness is the adventure of being with another person. “I see the true spring is in you,” he sings at one point, and it might just be the happiest moment on the record. For once he’s not wishing he were an eagle or a tempest or a sunset. He is just Bill Callahan, flying his small plane with a co-pilot by his side, and for the moment at least, that is enough.",

        "article_text": "Every religion began as a cult. In their early years, Belle and Sebastian possessed near-totemic powers for their small but impassioned band of disciples, as fervent as the followers of similarly wistful, self-deprecating, and sometimes sexually conflicted artists like the Smiths, Felt, and Orange Juice a decade prior. The common sacrament was pop, with true believers bearing witness in their communal alienation, badges, battered cassettes, and fanclub memberships. The Scottish group only heightened that devotion by shrouding themselves in mystery-- not answering questions, not appearing in proper photographs, not available in stores.\nOn sixth proper album The Life Pursuit, Belle and Sebastian want to teach the world to sing, in however imperfect harmony. Where the recent live re-recording of 1996s If Youre Feeling Sinister draped their most appealing songs in apposite finery, the bands latest extends their newfound confidence to content as well as delivery, and stands as the finest full-length by Stuart Murdoch and his shifting collaborators since that distant pinnacle. About his early-90s recovery from chronic fatigue, Murdoch told a recent interviewer, \"Spirituality and songwriting were my crutches.\" Spanning glam, soul, country, and 70s AM rock, this record is a deceptively wry, wickedly tuneful testament to the fragile beauty of faith, in deities as well as in pop.\nBelle and Sebastian seem to have found new life in their evolution from shy bedsit savants to showy pop adepts. The Life Pursuits lavishness renders the burgeoning bubblegum of 2003s Trevor Horn-produced Dear Catastrophe Waitress merely transitional, rewarding the Job-like righteous after the trials of the bands mid-career disappointments. Recorded in Los Angeles with Tony Hoffer, who oversaw Becks divisive Midnite Vultures, the album runs over with flute, horns, call-and-response vocals, and even a funky clavinet (on soul survivor \"Song for Sunshine\"). The playing, meanwhile, is surprisingly chopsy, down to the breezy guitars and Hammond organs-- a far cry from the days when indie meant never having to say you tried.\nFaith, after all, takes work, and if in one sense The Life Pursuit is about belief in the redemptive power of music, its also a manifestation thereof. On opener \"Act of the Apostle, Part One\", a girl with a seriously ill mother imagines an escape, plays the Cat Stevens hymn \"Morning Has Broken\", and contemplates an endless melody before stumbling upon the albums central question: \"What would I do to believe?\" Ostinato bass, splashy piano, and Sarah Martins gentle harmonies point the way. Toward the end of the albums loose storyline, on \"For the Price of a Cup of Tea\", the heroine seeks solace in \"soul black vinyl,\" as Murdoch channels an irrepressible Bee Gees falsetto.\nIn between the opener and \"Act of the Apostle, Part Two\", nine tracks later, The Life Pursuit sets aside the nascent narrative to offer several of Belle and Sebastians catchiest pop songs yet. \"The Blues Are Still Blue\" and \"White Collar Boy\" both incorporate glossy T. Rex boogie, Murdoch delivering one of his most indelible hooks on the former and uttering an uncharacteristically soulful \"huh!\" on the latter. Early mp3 preview \"Another Sunny Day\" sounds more like earlier Belle and Sebastian, setting country/western guitar licks to a sunny but sad love song that ambles past soccer, midges, Eskimos, and haunted hearts. First single \"Funny Little Frog\" slyly relates a love that turns out to be from afar, tellingly comparing the feeling to a sound from the narrators \"thro-at.\" Sharing its efficient Motown guitar style is the lone Stevie Jackson contribution, \"To Be Myself Completely\", which happily holds its own, observing, \"To be myself completely/ Ive just got to let you down.\"\nStill, theres little to fault about this albums songcraft, and Murdoch is also at his best detailing some of his famously quirky characters. \"Sukie in the Graveyard\" makes room for a pristine guitar solo, organs, and horns in a loose, animated tale of a runaway. On melancholic centerpiece \"Dress Up in You\", Murdoch at first seems to be describing an encounter with a groupie, but ultimately is revealed to be singing from the point of view of a woman to a former rival-turned-star.\nOf course, the album also wrestles with the struggle to have faith in God. To be sure, Murdochs Christian beliefs have been central to his songs since long before you could say \"Sufjan.\" The religious references here have more in common on their face with the Godspell gab of Waitresss \"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love\" than the sardonically wrought church scenes of \"The State That I Am In\" or \"If Youre Feeling Sinister\". Amid atypically fancy guitarwork and Martins breathless scat on \"We Are the Sleepyheads\", Murdoch recalls, \"We talked about the things we read in Luke and John.\" With the feel of Paul McCartney doing Tin Pan Alley, \"Act of the Apostles, Part Two\" finds Murdoch returning to the girl from the introduction. \"The bibles my tool/ Theres no mention of school,\" he sighs, then merges the albums twin motifs: \"My Damascan Roads my transistor radio.\" Converted to pop, she was converted to Jesus.\nThough the music may be even shinier and happier than on Waitress, the girls religious impulses dont resolve themselves nearly so blithely. Midway through \"Part Two\", the album climaxes when she determines to find \"the face behind the voice\": Synths flutter like stomach butterflies as the melody from \"Part One\" returns and the young protagonist attempts to attend a church service, only to be told to \"bugger off.\" Next she places her hopes in music alone, spending the night with a man who makes her \"the village joke.\" Closer \"Mornington Crescent\"-- named for a London Underground stop and a laughably complex strategy game-- sketches a final fall from grace, giving itself to sin and countrified guitars out of \"Wild Horses\".\nOnly a few bands have managed to successfully reinvent themselves a half-dozen or so albums into their careers. Granted, Murdochs is a very different group today than the one that caught the ears and hearts of pop-music zealots a decade ago, with different members and a newly unrestrained sound. \"Make a new cult every day,\" Murdoch once sang, but of course, Heavens Gate and Waco compounds arent for everyone. The Life Pursuit is a baroque pop cathedral, welcoming the faithful and newly converted alike.\n ",

        "article_text": "People fixate, but theres more to Sunn 0))) than robes and the Earth and AMP-derived name. Not only does the bands dark, heavy, theatrically composed sixth album, Black One, transcend the duos previous material, overall its one of the strongest records of the past year: Greg Anderson and Stephen OMalley have unleashed a doomngloom masterpiece.\nUltra cinematic and nearly matching Sunn 0)))s live power, Black Ones seven tracks will even please those who cant deal with uninterrupted drone. Getting assistance from key friends, including harsh noise icon John Wiese, the band overlaps smaller drone bits with the usual gargantuan exercises-- its staged like corpsepainted Noh drama. Opener \"Sin Nanna\"-- on which the wonderful Australian experimental guitarist and percussionist Oren Ambarchi handles all the instruments-- is the mood setter, and is named for a moon god who sported a lapis lazuli beard and rode a winged bull. Its followed by \"It Took the Night to Believe\" which transitions the listener into the longer works. The six-minute piece begins in media res, as if the recording tape hits a snag and snaps back into action. Power chords drop in quick succession over smoky bass drone; the brutal ghost cry comes courtesy of U.S.-based black metal favorite Leviathan, aka Wrest. In some regards its Sunn 0)))s most straightforward metal song to date, though its series of ebb/flows is anything but typical.\nThe bulk of the album-- each of the final five tracks are at least eight minutes long, with four of them moving past the 10:00 mark-- begins with an extended cover of Immortals \"Cursed Realms (of the Winterdemons)\". Here Xasthur aka Malefic is cast asunder, grumbling about ravens, cursed realms, and the central thesis that \"the face of the earth/ Will be to know black silence.\" Its more than two times as long as the original and built largely around Malefics sub-tonal scowls and bleeding feedback drone.\nThen comes the more old-school Sunn 0)))- and Earth-sounding \"Orthodox Caveman\", 10 minutes of pure drone made flesh with Wieses digital noise and Ambarchi on drums. \"CandleGoat\", which OMalley says is \"an evolution of an artwork collaboration with Savage Pencil,\" includes soft-lit ambiance at its intro courtesy of Wiese and features a gravel-voiced OMalley on the mic.\nEach piece is strong, but the albums highlight is its glacial, sprawling, anguished closer, \"Báthory Erzébet\". The tracks a reference to Elizabeth Báthory, and likely also the Swedish black metal band her surname spawned. Báthory was an occult-friendly member of the Transylvanian royal family who is reputed to have killed hundreds of young girls. Some legends even claim she thought the lifeblood of virgins would keep her young, so she not only tortured and killed her victims but also bathed in or drank their blood. Báthory died in 1614 imprisoned in her own castle. Perhaps mirroring Báthorys lock-down, Sunn 0))) crammed Malefic in a casket (inside a Cadillac hearse) with only a microphone and his fear of small spaces. His resulting petrified, dry-bones performance and the claustrophobic recording technique should net a Grammy. Leading up to the star turns a gentle hum throughout which Ambarchi weaves in a gong, bells, cymbal, and guitar. Then comes the teeming Anderson/OMalley assault, announcing the most triumphant avant-rock moment in recent memory.\nOkay, Anderson and OMalley have long hair and they populate their ambient universes with some likeminded players (whether Julian Cope or Joe Preston), but theres no reason for their work to be ghettoized as some cartoonish Dungeons \u0026 Dragons dog-and-pony show. Ive spoken at length to OMalley and can say, without a doubt, that hes one of the most intelligent people Ive encountered (from any walk of life) and that he and Anderson plan to continually refine and complicate both their sound and the theories they hold about musical composition. (The last person I encountered so knowledgeable and rigorous about his own work was Tony Conrad.)\nWith Black One, Sunn 0))) harnesses the sounds and moods of black metal, then expands its palette through meticulous experimentation and a commitment to the physicality of sound. The result is a beautiful, deep, passionate reflection of lifes bleakest corners.\n ",

        "article_text": "Whats the stat, 99% of all songs are love songs? And whats the other, 99% of all love songs make me want to slit my face? Swedish indie pop group Love Is All admit as much in their bandname and album title. Its not necessarily a joke, but theyre in on it: All people-- not just songwriters, Hallmark cards, and bridge-and-tunnel dudes in party shirts and going-out jeans-- struggle talking love. Most hack it up; others come too wry on the game, too whiny, or their cleverness can be disgusting. Love Is All make it work cos they know their snags-- shitty equipment, love-lyrical cliché, inevitable Life Without Buildings and Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparisons-- and speed headlong into them regardless. Theres a dire necessity to Nine Times That Same Song, and ultimately thats its charm.\nLike the other recordings on the New York-based Whats Your Rupture? label, the playing happens beneath a prophylactic lo-fi glaze. All sounds seem to hit the mic at once, and our ears forgive the occasional imprecisions for the overall fit. So thats the musical counterpart to the lyrical problem-- turning lo-fi from a ho-hum excuse to a gritty asset. But we respond to passion, not perfection, and like your ESGs and Delta 5s, this band makes do like a motherfucker.\n\"Things, they arent going that well,\" confesses singer Josephine Olausson on \"Used Goods\", which comes early in Nine Timess faint love-cycle sequencing: fall out, get over, fall in again. The song has sympathy for the stalker, who follows around town the one about to break her heart, noting those worthless similarities we all think actually mean something (\"we like the same kind of cheese\"). The guitar melody hams, and the rhythm sections on some Looney Tunes-meets-Orange Juice disco chase-scene bit, and funny synths poke out towards the end-- somehow the song communicates the complex of madness, embarrassment, and \"everybody does it, right?\"-ness of watching someone pull away. \"I dont mind used goods,\" she admits ashamedly.\nMost times, though, the lyrics hide deep in reverb; LIAs most affecting turns are musical, and often extremely minimal. \"Talk Talk Talk Talk\" combines Daft Punks \"one more time!\" chorus mourning in monotone, Karen Os \"rich rich rich\" snarl, James Chance sax skronk, and vicious call-and-response figures in support of the songs only intelligible line: \"Please just leave me alone.\" But all thats just a set-up for the bands pregnant mid-song pause-- they come back in a beat earlier than we expect-- and the songs tense last note, one half-step away from resolving. \"Ageing Has Never Been His Friend\" tones down the desperation and ups the dance with a bigger beat, bass octaves, and a happy-go-lucky sax line to underscore the songs misplaced hopes that all things love will stay \"fresh and young\": \"I keep the one I love/ In the freezer.\" By \"Turn the Radio Off\", no more bang: The sax plays out of tune, guitarists pluck out the chords as if theyve lost all patience, and Olausson delivers the frustrated refrain, \"Hey world, Ive had enough!\"\nThe rest of Nine Times happens on the upswing, starting with the utterly optimistic sing-along \"Make Out Fall Out Make Up.\" A counterpart to \"Turn the Radio Off\" in a way, the song acknowledges How Things Are, but grants \"I think Ill stay all day in bed\" a positivity \"Radio\" previously denied. \"Busy Doing Nothing\" takes nervous pleasure in the out-of-sight, out-of-mind getting-over-you process-- \"Five movie marathons! Nine times that same song!\"-- and another deceptive stop/start and smart key change make this song the most exciting one on the album. The pretty two-speed romance ballad \"Felt Tip\" flirts with obscurities (stuff about \"spray cans\" and \"finger tips\" and \"step right on the beat\"), but thats romance is it not? A conflation of meta-metaphors and the prowl, this song about graffiti never says, brilliantly, \"The writings on the wall.\"\nAnd then were back again, in the frenzy of the fresh and young, \"clapping hands up in the air,\" saying yeah, unraveling your reactions. The band could have ended Nine Times-- a bit solipsistic but deservedly so-- on the lonely what-to-do of \"Turn the TV Off\", the albums ninth song har-har. Too easy. In an album thats so anxiously avoided these types of cliches, the power-pop ditty \"Trying Too Hard\" truly seals the kiss with an afterthought: \"I was trying way too hard.\" Havent we all.",

        "article_text": "Death Grips are angry. Its unclear why. But their thirst for vengeance, their monomaniacal desire to visit fiery destruction on the powers-that-be, is crystal-clear on The Money Store, even if nothing else-- where the hell this album came from; who plays which instrument; what the lead singer is yelling about; and what on earth this band of insurgents is doing signing an Epic Records contract with L.A. Reid-- makes much sense at all. When playing this album, the only thing Im sure of is my overwhelming desire to split my forehead open on a cinder block.\nThe Sacramento group seems to have landed from an alternate planet, or at least an alternate decade when defiantly mutant outfits like this were occasionally given major-label backing. Theyve been persistently tagged as \"rap rock\" for context, but its not a very useful description of their music. For starters, not much of The Money Store scans as rock: Its confrontational, abrasive, and chaotic, but only one of its 13 tracks includes a remotely guitar-like noise (\"Ive Seen Footage\") and even that turns out to be a bent, sickly synthesizer. Most of the album is an alien swarm of buzzing and sputtering noises. Death Grips Zach Hill, a drummer for the fiendishly technical noise-rock band Hella, has also chewed his way through numerous projects, including work with Marnie Stern and Boredoms, and bits of all this float through The Money Stores wildly unpredictable 41 minutes.\nWhatever L.A. Reid was thinking when he signed these guys, he surely didnt meddle in their creative process. Sometimes this hands-off approach backfires, but Death Grips have actual designs to be left to, and The Money Store is a million-mph blur of ideas. One can only imagine how many hours it took to make Hills drums sound like theyre traveling inward from every corner of the mix toward its center, but the music seems to be constantly lunging out at you from all sides. A Bollywood vocal sample on \"Punk Weight\" is obliterated by a mortar-round hailstorm of viciously treated percussion. On \"Hustle Bones\", a tar-thick drone of indeterminate origin (guitar? computer?) pops into a glitter of synthesized voices. And \"Hacker\", the final track, hits a peak that the entire album seems to gather towards: With its simple chorus chant (\"IM IN YOUR AREA\") and uncharacteristic amount of empty space, its the only song Death Grips have recorded so far that tugs at your hips as much as it bludgeons your skull.\nAs for \"rap\": To call what lead vocalist Stefan Burnett (aka MC Ride) does \"rapping\" stretches the definition of the word beyond what even an avowed Lil B and Waka Flocka Flame fan like me can endorse. Burnetts deranged shouting brings a lot of things to mind-- Mark E. Smith with his mouth full, Jim Jones during an air raid, Sloth from The Goonies-- but rapping isnt one of them. Follow his lines closely and youll slam up against the realization that youre largely transcribing word salad: \"The fuck you staring at/ You know Id be so quick to flash/ Terrified of the way a basilisk come out and skin so fast,\" Burnett barks on \"The Cage\". But his hoarse, panicked voice functions as primal fight-or-fight communication: Things Are Not All Right.\nThe clearest link through all the pop-culture static to the music Death Grips make is back to the ultra-aggressive, defiantly ignorant, and proudly dumb American hardcore punk-metal moment of the 1980s-- right along the Suicidal Tendencies/Fear/Cro-Mags axis. I dont watch a lot of skate videos these days, but I know a great highlight-reel song when I hear it, and every moment of The Money Store qualifies. Like those bands, Death Grips appeals to the knuckle-dragging troglodyte and the smirking smart kid in us: thick-headed goonery and bookish, viscera-free nerdiness, making beautifully misanthropic music together. Granted, The Money Store is about as intellectual an experience as a scraped knee. But its just as good at reminding you that youre alive.",

        "article_text": "Beach Houses decision to call this record Bloom is almost too perfect. Over the course of four albums thats exactly what this band has done. Two people from Baltimore started by making incense-smelling, curtains-drawn bedroom pop. Now, eight years later, they make luminous, sky-sized songs that conjure some alternate universe where Cocteau Twins have headlined every stadium on Atlantis. \"Bloom\" is also what these 10 songs do, each one starting with the sizzle of a lit fuse and at some fine moment exploding like a firework in slow motion. The word captures the musics slow sonority: the round, gleaming edges of Alex Scallys arpeggios and how, in Victoria Legrands unhurried mouth, all words seem to have a few extra vowels.\nAnd here we thought theyd already bloomed. Two years ago, Beach House signed to big-time indie Sub Pop, started selling out larger rooms, and put out their first great record, Teen Dream. Brimming with lush sadness and lyrics that painstakingly documented the evaporation of a love (\"It cant be gone,\" Legrand gasped on \"10 Mile Stereo\", \"Were still right here\"). Teen Dream was a break-up album, a clearer and more assured exploration of the exquisite, minor-key feelings the band had been mining since their self-titled debut. It felt like such a complete realization of the bands potential that it had to make you wonder-- a little worried, even-- where could they possibly go from here?\nBloom suggests that this is the wrong question. \"I hate it when bands change between records,\" Scally admitted recently. \"[T]hats not the way we work.\" And hes right: Beach House havent changed, or at least not much. Bloom doesnt stray far from the structure or the emotional tenor of its predecessor. It finds the band making small, sharp adjustments to its craft, but these shifts are so subtle it takes a few listens for them to sink in. The songwriting is tighter, yet the atmosphere feels more diffuse; the lyrics are more straightforward, yet theyre somehow suggestive of larger things. By just about every measure, Blooms wingspan is fuller than anything Beach House have done before.\nMuch of the power of Beach Houses music lies in the way it forgoes simple, this-means-this storytelling in favor of communicating indescribable emotions. Still, Bloom has a definite thematic fascination with idle youth and the bittersweet residue that remains once its gone. \"Troublemaker\" looms with the threat of bad romance, and the brazen, epic \"Wild\"-- one of their best songs yet-- conjures teenage feelings of boredom, broken homes (\"Our father wont come home, cause he is seeing double\"), and the inordinate amounts of faith placed in the things that take someone out of those particular hells (\"Thats when your car pulls up, its hood is black and gleaming\"). Legrands ethereal contralto huffs so much life into her lines that even lyrics that look plain on the page take flight. Throughout, Legrand and Scally sound in perfect sync: his nimble riffs punctuate her long, drawn-out notes to add depth and layered rhythm to the tracks.\nToward the end comes a mid-tempo, quietly spectacular song called \"Wishes\", on which Legrand sings about \"the moment when a memory aches.\" It might be tempting to call that feeling nostalgia. But the sort of nostalgia Bloom employs feels so distant from the definition that word has taken on lately when we talk about music. What they do feels not just wonderfully self-contained but improbably intimate: Its a huge testament to Legrand and Scally that, although theyre one of the most popular bands in the indiesphere at the moment, their music still has the hushed air of an overheard secret.\nFilmmakers call the part of the day right before the sun goes down \"the magic hour.\" Its that brief moment when the waning daylight causes everything to take on a holy, hazy glow. It took Terrence Malick about a year to shoot his 1978 movie Days of Heaven because he insisted on filming only during this time of day, but the results perfectly capture and distend that dizzy, overripe feeling of right before something very good ends. Bloom does that, too. \"What comes after this momentary bliss?\" Legrand wonders on \"Myth\". Its a question Beach House dont seem interested in answering any time soon. Because thats become their signature magic trick: stopping time right before the sun disappears over the horizon, tricking you into believing a feeling can last forever.",

        "article_text": "Does a rapper need to make a truly great album before hes considered one of the best alive? Its a question with no objective answer. Some rappers are phenomenal with verses and punchlines but have no knack for hooks or song structure. Some can do all of those things but lack personality. Some never get the production budget they deserve; many do and just have the worst ear for beats. Some fail to capitalize on their buzz, and others are completely incapable of making themselves relevant. And yet, none of that explains why Killer Mike has been able to consistently make some of the most visceral and intellectually potent hip-hop of the past decade and a half without having a true classic under his belt. \nOn the unimpeachable R.A.P. Music, Mike hooks up with 2012 MVP frontrunner El-P and Adult Swim subsidiary Williams Street to create whats described on the title track as \"what my people need and the opposite of bullshit.\" Its the 2012 equivalent to Ice Cube and the Bomb Squads similarly inspired bicoastal union on AmeriKKKas Most Wanted. Limiting himself to one producer, legends-only guest spots, and a real sense that hed better make this one count, Killer Mike rises to the occasion.\nBut while this record is sure to please longtime fans, it also works as a compelling introduction. As in the past, R.A.P. Music takes a stand politically without going off the grid into conspiracy theorizing or sounding so circumspect that youd think Mike himself was running for public office. On \"Reagan\", he calls out the government for spending billions of taxpayer dollars invading foreign land as \"a hobby paid for by the oil lobby.\" To him, the \"War on Drugs\" is mostly an excuse for crooked cops to illegally search and seize young black men. But if you happen to be a phony rapper thats dumb enough to spit that \"fiction sold by conglomerates\" in Mikes neighborhood, you can expect to leave without your chain and dignity. None of this is contradictory to anyone with a lick of sense, but theres a tangible thrill in hearing someone tell it like it is with such conviction.\nThere was enough spleen vented on the Grind mixtapes to last until the next decade; on R.A.P., theres more heart and soul, both musically and spiritually. In a recent interview with Pitchfork.tv, Mike seemed particularly fond of the scene he sets during \"Untitled\", wherein the women closest to him in life are placed within an epic historical scale: \"Will my woman be Corretta take my name and cherish it?/ Or will she Jackie O drop the Kennedy, remarry it/ My sister say its necessary on some Cleopatra shit/ My grandmamma said no, never that, its sacrilege.\" Its part of a deep respect for family that runs throughout R.A.P. Music, whether its to his cop father during the \"fuck the police\" narrative \"Dont Die\", or his wife amidst astonishing Southernplayalistic pimp shit on \"Southern Fried\". He dedicates the last verse to her (\"I married a Trina/ Pretty as a singer/ Fine as a stripper\"), informing all other girls that if you want a piece of Killer Mike, you gotta service his woman too. Its actually kinda heartwarming.\nLets take a moment and talk about the actual rapping on R.A.P. Music. Dear lord, the rapping on this thing. When he first started appearing on dirtier OutKast tracks like \"Snappin \u0026 Trappin\", Mike mightve been seen as the devil on Big Bois shoulder opposite André. Its become clear since then he takes a backseat to no one in the Dungeon Family. Transcribing a jaw-dropping bout of dexterity like, \"And whats happenin/ Ménage-a-nage in my garage/ With these two young ladies is the reason I A.D.I.D.A.S./ Thats all day I dream about that sex scene/ You textin hopin that they call you/ I just barbecue and call em up and say, hey fall through,\" feels about as effective as trying to explain Led Zeppelin IV with guitar tablature. Mike introduces himself on \"Untitled\", saying, \"You are witnessing elegance/ In the form of a black elephant,\" and its a perfect summation of Mikes muscular yet impossibly nimble vocals. Theres no reason for him to make a two-minute, no-hook track like \"Go!\" other than to prove he can destroy anyone in terms of pure technique \"even when I aint sayin sheeeit.\" The sheer sonic effect of the volley of words on R.A.P. could thrill a hip-hop fan who doesnt speak a word of English.  \nNot that you shouldnt be paying attention to what Killer Mike says throughout R.A.P. Music.  \"Reagan\" is the one that names names and cites facts to denigrate the presidency as little more than \"telling lies on teleprompters\" to serve the \"countrys real masters.\" But on \"Anywhere But Here\", the trickle-down effect of corruption is felt on a more local scale. After solemnly acknowledging the police brutality and economic stratification of New York, Mike takes a look at his home city of Atlanta, seemingly a \"black males heaven\" as one the most racially progressive in the nation, \"Even though its blacktop from the mayors to the cops/ Black blood still gets spilled.\" \"Dont Die\" shows a vivid example of that: Cops break into Mikes house on a hunch and things inevitably get violent. Though the concept of their being there in the first place because \"a nigga on this rap shit\" might initially sound trite, if you dont believe the suspicion of being a part of that culture is enough to get you harassed and then killed, you might need to start watching the news. Thats really why \"Dont Die\" can take its place alongside anti-authoritarian classics like \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\": The big picture is timeless; the news fills in the blanks to make it depressing in its timeliness.\nThere are plenty of hip-hop records with worthy causes but the good intentions dont always make your car stereo knock. Thats not an issue here: I dont think well hear a better end-to-end production job on a rap record than we do on R.A.P. Music. El-P has managed to make strides in learning to give a rapper like Mike what he needs: on 2009s ATL RMX, he reconfigured Young Jeezys \"I Got This\" with a punishing beat that somehow managed to overexert its will on the guy rapping. We get wheezing organs, incessantly ticking hi-hats, guitar skronk, and soul claps tamed to do Mike and Els evil bidding whether its B-boy boom bap (\"Jojos Chillin\") or chain-swang braggadocio (\"Butane (Champions Anthem)\"). Im tempted to call it \"warm,\" but so is nuclear radiation, and the bass most often sounds like a monstrous, gleefully evil sandworm that could guest star on \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\".\nOn the closing title track, Mike equates R.A.P. Music to something holy, within the lineage of the most legendary black musicians: \"That Miles Davis Bitches Brew, that beee-yatch said by playboy Too [$hort].\" More appropriate are the multiple lyrical nods to Public Enemy and N.W.A., even if R.A.P. Music doesnt break enough rules or have enough of a platform to reach the levels of Fear of a Black Planet or Straight Outta Compton or Death Certificate. But it does come off as the kind of powerful mid-career album those acts shouldve been able to make as hip-hops elder spokesmen-- artists granted an evergreen relevance similar to Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young-- had it not been for their irreparable personnel issues: impervious to trends, passionate about politics and pleasure, something that a college professor could base a lecture on even as his students blast it at house parties later that night.",

        "article_text": "While discussing the burden of influence in 2005, James Murphy told us, \"The Strokes are swimming up some incredibly serious stuff: Velvet Underground. Television. Its kinda soul-crushing in a way to listen to Perfect Day and say, Im gonna go write a song like that, and itll be fucking horrible by comparison.\" At that point, the Strokes had yet to squander their leather-clad, LES cool, and LCD Soundsystem were still, mostly, a Williamsburg blip. But over the past five years, things changed. Drastically. In 2010, early aughts trendsetters like Interpol and the Strokes are NYC relics, outpaced by a gang of stridently preppy, chart-topping Columbia grads and a 40-year-old Brian Eno obsessive. On This Is Happening, Murphy once again shows off his encyclopedic knowledge of all things post-punk and zip-tight. But hes also swimming up some serious stuff himself, including Eno and David Bowies sacrosanct Berlin trilogy. And against his own prediction, its far from horrible; its actually pretty perfect.\n\"I spent my whole life wanting to be cool... but Ive come to realize that coolness doesnt exist the way I once assumed,\" said Murphy in a recent Guardian feature. This realization probably has something to do with his rising cultural cache. After all, Murphy has done what all other music fiends only dream about-- hes flipped the system and become the embodiment of coolness. This is a phenomenal coup. And hes quick to rationalize his current status to the New Yorker: \"I understand that if someones going to make me his idea of cool I cant control that.\"\nIts somewhat ironic, then, that Murphys reign as New Yorks ambassador of post-hip-everything finds him nearly losing his cool on This Is Happening. His early singles and first album were him joking to himself, Sound of Silver was a collective rush of us vs. them, and now its about him and her. This is also by far the bloodiest LCD Soundsystem album-- a series of bare, lacerating manifestos about distance between people, set to the fizzing art/dance-rock greatest hits inside Murphys skull. \"Love is a murderer,\" he sings on \"I Can Change\". Hes not kidding.\nOn the hypnotic dirge \"Somebodys Calling Me\", the vocal chameleon tries on narcotic whispers while taking Iggy Pops sleazy, empty-eyed \"Nightclubbing\" out of the club and into the bedroom. And though \"All I Want\" borrows that sliding Bowie guitar and kraut-y beat, Murphy makes it singe with his own tour-born regret, loss, and fatigue: \"You learn in your bed youve been gone for too long/ So you put in the time, but its too late to make it strong.\" Even considering his bold-name touchstones for This Is Happening, it would be shortsighted to cry rip-off; Murphy is remaking essential 70s art-rock in his own hyper-modern, self-aware image.\nThis fearlessness burrows its way into the rest of the album, making it more of a self-help guide to relationship hangovers than a woe-is-me fest. Opener \"Dance Yrself Clean\" starts quiet and stuffed with circular paranoia: \"Talking like a jerk except you are an actual jerk, and living proof that sometimes friends are mean,\" Murphy mumbles to himself. \"All My Friends\" this is not. But then a massive, meaty synth expands the speakers, lifts the singer up, and plops him down smack in the middle of the dancefloor. LCD Soundsystem has always excelled at making sounds for moving bodies, but now that motion is more entangled with other, less exuberant emotions. Potentially misguided frat anthem \"Drunk Girls\" is a punchline-laden lark that ends with, \"Be honest with me, honestly/ Unless it hurts my feelings.\" On earlier records, Murphy could sound like he didnt really mean it while hollering on the fly, but This Is Happening confirms him as a top-tier vocalist and lyricist capable of mixing heavy and light, lyrical and self-deprecating, sometimes in the same line: \"Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry... and this is coming from me.\"\nMurphys vast perspective and all-knowing mien are invaluable assets to his success. Recorded in L.A. instead of his hometown, This Is Happening finds the unlikely rock star zooming out even further in search of the realness and truth mentioned on the albums \"music about writing music\" track \"You Wanted a Hit\". And on the virtuoso rambler \"Pow Pow\", he seems to locate a perch where he can \"relax\" and \"see the whole place\" and understand \"advantages to both\" sides of any argument. Sounds nice. But by the end of the song, hes beset by confusion, numbness, and a false sense of security. \"What you want from now is someone to feel you,\" he croons. At first, Murphy showed how to let loose without losing your cool; now hes figuring out how to break down without cracking up.",

        "article_text": "Since the release of Spiritualizeds last album, 2008s Songs in A\u0026E, band leader Jason Pierce went on a nostalgic detour. The frontman has always weaved rocknroll history into his tunes, but this was different. The last few years saw Pierce reissuing his defining 1997 monument Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space as a boxed set and playing the grandiose album in full at a handful of memorable shows. The redux was a welcome reminder of that albums strung-out, gospel-blues magnificence; Ladies and Gentlemen aimed for the heavens, always, and reached them more often than not. But it also reminded us of how his ensuing three albums havent quite stacked up, how his psychedelic take on early rock may have nowhere else to go. As he told me earlier this year, revisiting his past masterpiece had Pierce thinking: \"If Im going to make new music now, it better be fucking good.\" \nSweet Heart Sweet Light fits that description. Yet its not a drastic transformation as much as an acute refinement. Pierce is still using large orchestras and choirs to take his Robert Johnson blues way past the crossroads, to vistas that are as endless as they are empty. Hes still singing his own rocknroll gospel: Jesus, fast cars, girls named Jane and Mary, pimps, death, fire, freedom, and God all show up, giving life to Pierces alternate-universe Eden, inhabited by Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, self-loathing, and a spitty syringe. Hes still his own genre-- this tiny voice elevated by the super-church-sized arrangements in his head. \"I want to make music that catches all the glory and beauty and magnificence, but also the intimacy and fragility, all within the space of the same 10 seconds,\" Pierce has said. Its a mad goal. But its also an inherently intriguing and universal one, just as ancient myths or Biblical tales can be. Pierce isnt religious, but he uses Christian language and figures as a thematic shorthand. \"As you have a conversation about Jesus, you know youre talking to him about how it is to be fallible and question yourself and your morals,\" he told me. \"When I sing, Help me, Jesus, you know Im not asking for help fixing the fucking car.\" Such an all-or-nothing attitude is risky, but thats the whole point.\nPierce mixed Sweet Heart over eight drawn-out months under something of a drug-induced stupor. But it wasnt the kind of drug-induced stupor Pierce is known for. At the time, he was being hit with experimental chemotherapy treatments to combat a degenerative liver disease. (Three doctors are thanked in the liner notes; Pierce is apparently OK now.) During this albums creation, the singer referred to it as Huh?-- a nod to his jumbled mental state. All of which would make one assume that Sweet Heart would be messy, fucked-up, and completely depressing. That is not the case. This is probably the most uplifting album of his career. \nRelatively speaking, that is. \"Sometimes I wish that I was dead,\" he sings on \"Little Girl\", \"Cause only the living can feel the pain.\" Safe to say: Jason Pierce will not be singing next to Big Bird on \"Sesame Street\" anytime soon. This is an end-of-your-rope, nothing-left-to-lose kind of comfort marked by equal doses of fierce distortion and sentimental strings. And theres more reflection here, too. \"All I want in lifes a little bit of love to take the pain away,\" he famously sang, starkly vulnerable, on Ladies and Gentlemens title track. Here, though, hes more considered. On the lovelorn ballad \"Too Late\", most of the movie-score violins drop out as Pierce sighs out the kind of profundity perhaps only age can offer: \"This is dedicated baby, what more can I say?/ I wont love you more than I love you today/ And I wont love you less, but Ive made my mistakes/ Stay away from love dear if thats what it takes.\" Naturally, he doesnt take his own advice and cant help but fall in love on the track anyway. But the disclaimer adds another layer to Pierces from-the-vein emoting. \nThis wiser perspective is also found on the nine-minute first single \"Hey Jane\", where the titular rocknroll hellion is given some shade. Though the songs narrator is taken with the fast-living Jane, he \"aint got time to waste my time with you,\" too. Meanwhile, the music piles up into a car crash before returning as a sky-bound motorik pulse, like a Cadillac going 110 straight into the atmosphere. The scathing \"Get What You Deserve\" pairs \"Kashmir\"-like strings with what sounds like a guitar being popped in and out of its socket as Pierce offers a biting critique of rocknroll excess (and, by extension, the entire capitalist enterprise). \"Gonna shoot you while youre laying still/ I lost all of my emotion,\" he sings, taking the role of too-far-gone rock star/hedge-fund manager/corrupt politician, while the songs nagging dissonance suggests a chaos just beneath the surface.\nSimilarly, Pierce uses his deadpan to great effect as he casually dismisses the whole lot of humanity on the tremendous \"Headin for the Top Now\": \"In our haste to find a little more from life/ We didnt notice that wed died.\" Once again, not too life-affirming on paper. But the songs mash of angry feedback and a rumbling juke-joint piano/bass/drum backbone locates the unpredictable excitement of our collective folly. The songs outro, which has Pierces 11-year-old daughter Poppy singing of pimps and hustlers in a rhyme reminiscent of \"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\", only adds to the bizarre (and bizarrely joyful) disorientation. \nSo it makes strange sense that this exhilarating album about death and destruction should end with \"So Long You Pretty Thing\". The title references Bowies glam-generation anthem \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", but this is no simple tribute. Its a eulogy to those classic rocknroll dreams, as Pierce sings over and over: \"So long you pretty thing, God save your little soul/ The music that you played so hard aint on your radio/ And all your dreams of diamond rings, and all that rocknroll can bring you/ Sail on, so long.\" Which, coming from this 46-year-old whos never exactly set the charts ablaze, sounds like a terrible finale. And yet, backed by that choir and those horns, this is the finest, most enduring refrain Pierce has ever written-- a goodbye you never want to end.",

        "article_text": "For better or worse, Cut Copy swim in the same pool as those electro, French touch, and new wave revivalists for whom fashion, irony, and self-consciousness represent swords to live and die by. In a scene as self-reflexive as this, backlashes are the order of the day, but even still, there are signs-- such as the increasing use of \"blog house\" as an eye-rolling pejorative, recent records by Calvin Harris, Does It Offend You Yeah?, and Ghostland Observatory, and the parallel rise of Balearic-feeling dance as a worthy substitute-- that this world might be slipping under the weight of its own ubiquity. Based on their patchy and rainbow-chasing 2004 debut, Bright Like Neon Love there was every reason to believe that a new Cut Copy record this late in the cycle would only accelerate the meltdown; after all, there are only so many ways to arrange and re-arrange vibrant art direction, moneyed aloofness, and the right kinds of sounds before the party heads to a new venue altogether.\nAs it turns out, we neednt have been so cynical-- not when Cut Copy arent. If the pastichey Bright Like Neon Love felt more like an opportunistic patchwork quilt of other peoples sounds and ideas, the hugely enjoyable In Ghost Colours feels light, confident, and unencumbered by the dictates of fashion. More than anything, though, its a gloriously positive record, one whose cheerily strummed acoustic guitars, shimmering synths, sweeping choruses, and playful sonics maintain a delicate balance; where a lot of summer pop records like this often scream fun to the point of being oppressive (or at least annoyingly instructive), theres nothing remotely show-offy about In Ghost Colours. In fact, its closer in spirit to the Avalanches Since I Left You than it is to anything from the past few years. Its a hard record not to love.\nIn Ghost Colours was co-produced by DFAs Tim Goldsworthy, who deserves credit for simultaneously opening up the bands palette while relaxing their delivery. Sure, as you might expect, there are still blushes of French house and electro scattered liberally all over the show, but theyre always deployed in ways that serve-- rather than overshadow-- the song. And while Cut Copys principle and founding member Dan Whitford may come from a DJ background, the band-led songs come across every bit as muscular and as noteworthy as the dancefloor crossovers. To that end, this is one of the best bridges between electro and rock in a long time; the joins are so seamless that you dont even think of the songs on those terms.\nFrom the first swirling synths and gleaming melodies of curtain raiser \"Feel the Love\", In Ghost Colours asserts itself as a hugely magnanimous record. Everything here sounds stadium-sized, loved-up, and breezily inclusive. Theres the lead single \"Lights \u0026 Music\", an arena rock slow burner with a disco chorus; or the superb, helicoptering house of 2007 single \"Hearts on Fire\", which gets a welcome reprise; or the sunburst rock of \"Unforgettable Season\", which recalls Broken Social Scene in its ability to sound in full swoon from chord one; or the carefree \"Strangers in the Wind\", whose lazy verse and torpid guitar peels owe a little bit to Fleetwood Mac. Elsewhere, \"So Haunted\" and \"Far Away\" compete for standout track status, the former sandwiching verses of fuzzy guitar squall around one of the most gorgeous-sounding choruses of the year, the latter an effervescent bit of 80s synth fluff that holds up against the best of Human League and Erasure.\nSo yeah, you get the point: Pop lovers will find lots to love here, and if theres any justice, this record will keep them swooning through the summer. Regardless of what kind of audience it ultimately finds, though, In Ghost Colours earns its smiles with a combination of ingenuity and easiness that you dont often come by, and for that, even in April, it already feels like a triumph.",

        "article_text": "While it may seem as if theres not a new release without a hyphenated genre to give it birth, Bear in Heavens second LP feels fresh simply because it resists easy categorization or comparison. This isnt to say its sonically groundbreaking, though-- fitting for an album whose title references the four main navigational directions, Beast Rest Forth Mouth is as familiar-feeling as it is difficult to pinpoint. Mostly made up of textural, spacious three- to four-minute pop anthems with towering choruses, BRFM is a welcome reminder that an album doesnt have to be bombastic to feel huge and important. Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music thats bigger than your iPod-- music youll want to feel all around you.\nThough not quite coming out of nowhere, BRFM seems like a surprise gift-- a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework. In terms of career gear-shifts, the move Caribou made with Andorra is the most recent precedent. Though at 41 minutes the album is economical and sharp in its execution, the band-- all from Georgia and Alabama-- still imbues its compositions with the generosity of spirit that makes the best Southern rock so invigorating. \"Beast in Peace\" opens the record with a gentle lockstep before shifting seamlessly into a mile-wide chorus. Then, they expand that chorus even further, like switching to the widest camera lens to capture a vista they just realized the full vastness of. Elsewhere, as its title indicates, \"Ultimate Satisfaction\" is an IMAX-wide ode to what starts out as a simple thought, then turns bodily-- the refrain of \"coming down!\" charts the sensation spreading like a spasm. That towering exultation is also felt on the primal \"Deafening Love\". While aiming for a similar sense of awe-inspiring bliss, \"Love\" widens the focus and luxuriates in the tremors, approximating a more protracted take on Janes Addictions \"Mountain Song\".\nYet Bear in Heavens greatest trick is creating music that evokes the sort of physicality and scope that could soundtrack a Hollywood film, but also works equally well at stirring up intimate bodily passion. Lush synth beds, warm electronics accenting polyrhythms, and Jon Philpots yearning, boyish howl coalesce into a vibe thats muscular without being macho, and which strikes a rare balance between nuanced emotion and overwhelming sensation. Even when delving into more disconcerting subject matter-- dabbling in self-loathing on \"Wholehearted Mess\" or confronting paranoia on the slinky \"You Do You\"-- Philpot still manages to imbue the songs with an atmosphere of seduction and intrigue.\nAn album like BRFM couldnt exist without a paean to the most severe and high-stakes of endeavors, and first single \"Lovesick Teenagers\" more than meets the requirements for 2009s Epic Song About Tortured Young Romance. With briskly alternating synth chords spitting by like fast-moving highway stripes, the titular couple are doomed to crash, but most likely in a JG Ballard sort of way. The pair martyr themselves in order to eternalize their passion, and the band is generous enough to resurrect them later, in the reprise of \"Teenagers\" that closes the album, seamlessly and surprisingly emerging from \"Casual Goodbye\". As a gesture, its a slight nod backwards to the suite-like structures of their debut, but moreoever a celebration of abundance that wraps up an album overflowing with feeling. Its also an exclamation point signaling that Bear in Heaven not only clearly recognize their own best instincts, theyre not shy about dwelling on them. Sure, bands can adapt to the current musical climate by adding extras to LPs, tweaking release dates to accommodate fan interest, or even giving away their music free. A curtain call like \"Teenagers\", though: now thats generosity.",

        "article_text": "Late last year when blogs began to be flooded with takes on the M.I.A.-via-the-Clash \"Paper Planes\" riddim, two stood out: A remix that improved on the original by papering over some of the songs relative white space with fantastic verses from Bun B and Rich Boy, and \"Tengazako\" (\"Take Whats Yours\" in Chichewa), a collaboration between European production team Radioclit and Malawian-born, London-based singer Esau Mwamwaya. Since then, Mwamwaya raised his profile the quickest way one can in music blog circles-- via collaborations, covers, and remixes. Continuing their Six Degrees of Indie game, Radioclit and Mwamwaya leaked \"Get It Up\"-- which featured not only Maya herself, but also Santogold-- \"Kamphopo\", built on an Architecture in Helsinki track, and covers of the Beatles and Vampire Weekend featuring, respectively, the Ruby Suns and, uh, Vampire Weekend. The refreshing thing, however, was that unlike 95% of the superfluous odds and sods clogging blogspace, these tracks were actually really good.\nIts easy to be cynical about this process of easing Western listeners into Esau Mwamwayas music-- RIYL Vampire Weekend, Ruby Suns, other English-language artists cribbing from African music-- until you hear the music itself, and in particular the whole of he and Radioclits free mixtape, Are the Very Best. Once you get through the indie-guarded gates, Mwamwaya and Radioclit are open here to everything from South Africas marabi and kwaito music to Hans Zimmer scores to French and American hip-hop to Michael Jackson-- and in most cases, its the tracks that lean furthest away from the familiar that work best. The regal \"Sister Betina\", BLK JKS collaboration \"Salota\", and Radioclit productions \"Funa Funa\" and \"Kada Manja\" are as immediately likable as the rest of the mix. And, frankly, much of the best-known source material here-- \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\", the AiH backdrop on \"Kamphopo\", the True Romance via Badlands theme on \"Chikandi\", the loathsome Beatles song \"Birthday\"-- is either simply a blueprint or sketch for other ideas, or is vastly improved by Mwamwayas treatments.\nMwamwayas cultural cross-section is no accident. Although he sings in his native Chichewa, he met Radioclits Etienne Tron when he sold the producer a used bike in a London junkshop. Despite that, Mwamwaya and Radioclits talents lie far beyond cultural fusion and curatorial skills: In short, theyve created just about the most listenable and flat-out enjoyable record of the year-- and one that happens to dovetail nicely with the urgency for and overdue embrace of morally guided globalism.\nThose globalistic tendencies are, unfortunately, born as much from tragedies such as the Mumbai attacks and economic fears as they are the afterglow of Barack Obamas election. (And, sadly, not born out of crises in Darfur, Kenya, Chad, and far too many other places.) But culturally, this centurys renewed Western interest in the music of Africa, the Middle East, South America, China, and elsewhere seems largely free of the condescending and touristic tones that it carried in the 1980s. Instead of searching for a supposed antidote for MTV and synth-pop and whatever else got authenticity watchdogs up in arms a quarter-century ago, now it seems as if people are exploring increasing amounts of non-Western music simply because they have increased access to it and are enjoying the hell out of it.\nMwamwayas fusion, of course, cant be boiled down to Africa vs. the West, a laughably simplistic formula. Hes assimilating from a wide range of music both from his home continent-- the clattery, choatic sounds of kuduro or marabi, the refreshing blank space and clean lines of highlife, the deep, loping, patient kwaito-- and around the globe. So The Very Best is far from a primer, but its not aiming to be an introduction to anything other than the sensibilities and sounds of its creators. It turns out to be wide-ranging, not only in sound but spirit. Mwamwaya plays heart-tugging on the \"Birthday\" cover and \"Funa Funa\", gets earnest on \"Dinosaur on the Ark\", and displays a wicked sense of humor all over the place: An outstanding reworking of M.I.A.s \"Boyz\", the tongue-in-cheek cover art, and an extended runout of Michael Jacksons Free Willy theme \"Will You Be There\" that turns into a reminder that theyve given you this mixtape free followed by a plea to look out for (to still \"be there\" for) Mwamwayas proper album. In the meantime, consider this freebie an early holiday gift.",

        "article_text": "Almost midway into Pilot Talk, theres a line that gets right to the heart of Curren$ys appeal: \"Xbox web browser/ Download a updated NBA roster/ Play a 82-game season/ Condo full of snacks, Spitta not leaving.\" Not too many rappers could get away with bragging about sitting in their apartments all day playing NBA Live and eating Doritos, and even fewer would try. But Curren$y has hit a certain level of mixtape-level cult stardom in part because hes perfected his amiable everydude stoner persona, and that comes across vividly in that line even though he never mentions weed. He doesnt have to; its implied. The other thing about that line is its specificity. Curren$ys not just a guy who plays NBA Live all day; hes also one who makes sure he does it right, getting the updated roster. It might harsh his buzz if new Bull Carlos Boozer suddenly turned up in his old Utah Jazz uniform. He appreciates the smaller things.\nCurren$ys also had a weird, bounced-around career. The New Orleans rapper got his start in Master Ps then-waning No Limit empire, then jumped to Cash Money, playing foil and second banana to Lil Wayne during Waynes historic mixtape run a few years back. But he left the label just as Wayne was becoming the most popular rapper in the world. And he presumably did it so he could clear his own path, rapping about the stuff he actually cared about. Over a few years worth of heavy mixtape-circuit work, hes become a great rapper with his own aesthetic-- hes a nimble, affectless drawler who favors airy, spaced-out beats. Like friend and frequent collaborator Wiz Khalifa, hes become one of the dominant voices in the rap underground by making a form of unassuming stoner-rap that owes virtually nothing to J Dilla. And with Pilot Talk, he gets his moment.\nPilot Talk finds Curren$y working almost exclusively with 90s New York producer Ski Beatz-- an unexpected but inspired collaborative pairing. Ski, best known for the beats he contributed to Jay-Zs Reasonable Doubt, is even more beloved for Uptown Saturday Night, the album from the linguistically forward NYC duo Camp Lo that he helmed. And in a way, Pilot Talk strikes some of the same chords as Uptown-- smart kids bullshitting with each other, using rap to play around with language and talk as much fly shit as possible.\nMusically, Pilot Talk is a warm, low-key affair. Skis tracks can be breathtakingly gorgeous without ever getting in Curren$ys way. Theres a lush, languid, almost psych-rock feel to the album. Its so goddamn pretty throughout, all those guitars and pianos and organs and horns layered on top of each other. And Curren$y just inhabits this sonic wonderland, letting his voice sink deep into every track. Even though his delivery and persona couldnt be more different, hes got almost the same accent as B.G., another former Cash Money guy. And thats a great rap voice, just perfect for these wry little observations that hes so good at.\nTheres a lot of talk about money and girls on Pilot Talk-- and a whole lot of talk about weed-- but my favorite moments come when Curren$y takes delight in some random nonsense. On \"Skybourne\", he brags about how well-trained his dogs are. On \"Roasted\", he offers an enthusiastic endorsement of the lemonade at the Tribeca restaurant Bubbys (\"not that Minute Maid crap, they squeeze these lemons theyself\"). And on \"King Kong\", he offers this: \"Upstate New York, Woodstock, Saugerties/ The view from my rocking chair you would not believe.\"\nA few famous guests turn up on the album (Snoop Dogg, Mos Def), but most of those sitting in are friends like Trademark or underground peers like Big K.R.I.T. and an on-fire Jay Electronica, who offers the albums most energetic moment. About half the songs drift by without choruses, and the other half only barely have anything you could call a chorus. The whole thing is over in about 45 minutes. It all adds up to a woozy waft of a record-- a perfect listen for mid-summer, when breathing in the humid air is almost enough to get you high.",

        "article_text": "Arcade Fire never aim for anything less than grand statements. That quality has played a huge role in making them very, very popular; its also their greatest weakness. Funeral was wracked with agony and grief, but what made it one of the transcendent records of the 2000s was that it avoided easy answers. It proposed that the fight of our lives is just that, a fight, but a winnable one. But when they turned that same all-or-nothing intensity outward on Neon Bible, otherwise propulsive and elegant songs were sometimes bogged down by overblown arrangements or pedantic political statements. Youd figure an album bluntly called The Suburbs that focuses on The Way We Live might repeat some of Neon Bibles worst tendencies. Instead, its a satisfying return to form-- proof that Arcade Fire can still make grand statements without sounding like theyre carrying the weight of the world.\nThe metrics of The Suburbs are misleading: At 16 tracks, including interludes and multi-part songs, it might seem like Arcade Fire are shooting for their Sandinista!, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, or Sign O The Times-- a band at the peak of their powers reacting against the walls closing in by blowing everything up and trying anything. But the album actually plays out more like Bruce Springsteens The River, a generously paced collection of meditations on familial responsibility, private disappointments, and fleeting youth, much of which takes place in moving vehicles. It also reintroduces much-needed levity to an act that can be overbearingly self-serious. On the deceptively chipper chamber pop of \"Rococo\", Win Butler borders on patronizing, evoking Nirvanas \"In Bloom\" and using the title word as a sword to skewer an easy target: the hipster more concerned with following trends than locating a genuine understanding in the world around him. But the point is that Butler values directness and truth, and throughout The Suburbs, what he lacks in poetry, he makes up for with honesty.\nTheres a tension between the uneasily resolving chords and lightfooted piano shuffle on the title track, as Butler sings in a restrained falsetto: \"Sometimes I cant believe it/ Im moving past the feeling.\" As The Suburbs plays out, that \"feeling\" is one that lived on Funeral and is dying here. The initial fantasy of Funeral was escaping the neighborhood, dancing beneath the police lights, and living on misbehavior. The Suburbs can be seen as the update decades later, with those same kids having kids of their own, and moving back to and struggling in the same neighborhoods.\nThe heavy-handedness that marred some of Neon Bible mostly resulted from Butlers warning us of destruction caused by the lies of authority figures-- shady cultural impresarios, corrupt church leaders, politicians all too eager to push the button. But what makes The Suburbs a more humane and empathetic record is that Butler and Régine Chassagne have come to terms with how the pain of our day-to-day lives more often results from the lies we tell ourselves. At the outset of \"We Used to Wait\", staccato, minor-key piano chords evoke anxiety. The song is a simple lament about the exhaustion from a relentless pace of life that demands everything immediately. But as Jeremy Garas steady drums lift the piece into cathedral drama, its obvious that theres a deeper concern than the antiquation of letter-writing. By the time the narrator finds himself with \"the lights cut out... left standing in the wilderness downtown,\" its a sad reminder that giving up your dreams for a reliable job that pays your way and corrodes your soul isnt even a reliable option anymore. Soul-sucking work was at least once a dependably secure and profitable enterprise. Now what do we do?\nThe bulk of The Suburbs focuses on this quiet desperation borne of compounding the pain of wasting your time as an adult by romanticizing the wasted time of your youth. As bleak as the lyrics are, though, theyre buoyed by the bands leanest, loosest songwriting yet. These songs are busy, but never overly complicated, subtly nudging at their boundaries while allowing wide lanes for Butlers perfectly memorable melodic turns. The framework is familiar: Arcade Fires trademark of decorating AOR with orchestral fringe (\"Ready to Start\", \"Empty Room\"), sun-baked Harvest gold (\"Wasted Hours\", \"Suburban War\"), and in the records highlights, pulsating electro (\"Half Light II [No Celebration]\", \"Sprawl II [Mountains Beyond Mountains]\").\nBut The Suburbs is a record that seeks to build, and it reaches a monumental peak at its closure. Both parts of \"Sprawl\" act like a conversation between lovers and a treatise on what makes Arcade Fire tick: Butlers despondence on \"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" matches the desolate atmosphere that surrounds him-- returning to a mall-spackled hometown is an admission of defeat. But as with their first two albums, the penultimate song towers over what came before: \"Sprawl II\" is an Arcade Fire song through and through, balancing a sort of defiance in the midst of crushing circumstance (\"These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose/ But late at night the feelings swim to the surface\"). Its a rare and thrilling example of the group stepping out of their musical comfort zone, an airy disco bounce evoking \"Heart of Glass\" that serves as further evidence of just how crucial the often underappreciated Chassagne is in tempering Butlers grimmer outlook.\nThat said, the relative concision of Funeral and Neon Bible didnt allow for a whole lot of wiggle room. And while its somewhat heartening to hear something allowed to be a \"minor\" Arcade Fire song, theyre still, well, minor. \"Month of May\" strains too much for a ragged punk glory while the folky, Neil Young-ish strummer \"Deep Blue\" doesnt develop its Kasparov vs. IBM metaphor into more than an afterthought. And as The Suburbs reaches its second half, theres certainly some thematic redundancy-- surely, theres already a drinking game revolving around Butlers use of \"the kids.\"\nTheres also the possibility that The Suburbs can be seen as a lesser Arcade Fire album if you mostly value rock music for its escapism. This is another 2010 example of a Boss-indebted band (see also: the National and Titus Andronicus) making epic outpourings of modern disillusionment and disappointment for people who can commiserate and return to fretting about their jobs and bank accounts once the house lights go up. But just because the concerns of The Suburbs are at times mundane, that makes them no less real. And that Arcade Fire can make such powerful art out of recognizing these moments makes our own existences feel worthy of documentation. By dropping Neon Bibles accusatory standpoint, The Suburbs delivers a life-affirming message similar to Funerals: Were all in this together.",

        "article_text": "Scene-famous boyfriends, a quote-generating Twitter feed, scuffles with bloggers, and the most meme-generating feline since Keyboard Cat got carpal tunnel: Yeah, its safe to say Bethany Cosentino, who writes and records with cohort Bobb Bruno as Best Coast, is a long way away from her days as a member of drone/psych outfit Pocahaunted. Best Coasts full-length debut, Crazy for You, serves only to increase that distance from the outré-music scene; the brief record delivers on the promise of a strong string of singles released over the past year. Just as Pocahaunted loosely capture the basic feel of dub and reggae, Crazy for You is a meditation on the stickier hooks of classic indie pop, with slight detours into surf-rock (\"Bratty B\") and countrypolitan balladry (\"Our Deal\"). While Pocahaunted cover their signifiers under piles of static and delay-triggered noise, Best Coast take the opposite route, slathering honey over every song and letting them drip-dry in the sunshine.\nThe records overall gorgeousness has a whole lot to do with Cosentinos voice, which hits every pitch with equal clarity and intention of tone. Good thing, too, since Crazy For You is an especially vocal-heavy record; excluding the bonus track \"When Im With You\", there are few moments here where Cosentinos voice isnt featured. She backs herself wordlessly, fills in non-verbal gaps (especially in the California-highway chorus of \"When the Sun Dont Shine\"), and repeats simple sentiments like mantras (\"I wish he was my boyfriend,\" \"I want you so much,\" \"Thats not your deal, thats not my deal\").\nThat last function has become a sticking point for many who complain that, as a lyricist, Cosentino lacks a certain depth and overall intelligence. Its true that shes not exactly the Randy Newman of the beach-pop game-- theres a few too many \"crazy/lazy\" rhyme schemes, and feel free to snicker at the \"I wish my cat could talk\" line from \"Goodbye\". But its easy to miss that, just as these songs are relatively basic in construction, shes never aimed for any sort of lyrical grandiosity-- just feelings, presented as straightforwardly as possible.\nSimply put, she knows what shes doing-- and, lo and behold, theres more lyrical complexity to this record than a fault-seeking light listen would glean. Just when you think youve gotten the point of \"Boyfriend\", Cosentino flips the script and reveals that she isnt just envious-- she feels inadequate, too: \"The other girl is not me/ Shes prettier and skinnier/ She has a college degree/ I dropped out when I was 17.\" In \"The End\", she verges on nihilistic, admitting in the songs chorus that shell ruin it all permanently for temporary wish fulfillment: \"You say that/ Were just friends/ But I want this/ Till the end.\" Shes not being submissive or simple-minded-- shes being honest, and regardless of sweeping appeal, its endearing that she puts herself out there instead of throwing on some sunglasses and using irony as UV protection.\n\"Endearing\" is the key word that comes to define Crazy for You; while most of the guitar-based indie pop thats made waves over the past few years has been characterized by scenester antagonism and attempts to fit in (Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, Beach Fossils), this record is carefree and instantly likable-- even if it doesnt seem to care what you think of it. Just as you dont have to be into bong rips and strains of Indo to laugh at Cosentinos 140-character riffs on Katy Perry and True Blood, even the least indie-inclined of listeners can find plenty to love here. It may be a summer album by design (I mean, for Christs sake-- that cover), but Ill place my bet that Crazy for You will sound pretty great all damn year, and beyond.",

        "article_text": "Ought are a band from Montreal on Constellation Records, which is both the most obvious and most misleading thing you can say about them. For one, they’re not actually Montreal natives, or even Canadians—their collective passports list birthplaces as far-flung as New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Australia. Furthermore, their tetchy, talkative brand of art-punk makes them anomalies on a Constellation roster that, from the foundational releases of Godspeed You! Black Emperor to current franchise players like Colin Stetson, has mostly favored the abstract over the elemental. But this outsider’s vantage is precisely what makes Ought’s debut album, More Than Any Other Day, so endearing and electrifying. It’s an anxious, distressed record to be sure—brimming with feelings of disaffection and dislocation—but it presents itself as such simply to show you how that nervous energy can be put to more positive, constructive use. \nAs legend has it, Ought came together at McGill University in 2012 during the “Printemps Erable”—i.e., the “Maple Spring,” when a push by the Quebec government to increase tuition fees across the province by 75 per cent prompted thousands of students to walk out of the classroom and into the streets for mass protests and school boycotts that lasted into the fall. For the members of Ought, it was an especially eye-opening experience, both as an immersion into Quebec’s proud tradition of civil unrest, and the celebratory, often musical form it can assume: the most enduring image of the 2012 movement is the sight of students and supporters dancing through neighbourhoods, banging on pots and pans in percussive protest. (A snippet of such a gathering can be heard in the dying moments of “Mladic” on Godspeed’s 2012 comeback release, Allelujah! Don’t Bend, Ascend!)\nNow, More Than Any Other Day contains absolutely no songs about Quebecois education policy or the rising cost of living for undergrads. However, over its eight tracks, Ought strive to recapture and inspire that same sense of anarchic abandon they witnessed on the streets on Montreal in 2012. To that end, they couldn’t have chosen a more emblematic album cover—not because, as some have pointed out, its image of hands clasped in a show of solidarity bears an uncanny resemblance to another debut album from an idealistic rock band, but because, as the liner notes reveal, that photo was found discarded atop a dumpster. Accordingly, More Than Other Day is Ought’s effort to ensure that the basic tenets of passion and commitment don’t get tossed aside amid a culture of instant gratification and distraction, and remind their hashtag activist generation of how it really feels to feel. This is a manifesto to write more manifestos.  \nAnd as singer/guitarist Tim Beeler convincingly illustrates throughout the record, the process of reconnecting with your inner iconoclast can be more potent than any drug. In the standout, Marquee Moon-lit ballad “Habit”, the addiction in question is to the act of expression itself, and the liberating/empowering sensation of getting something off your chest (even if the strung-out, string-screeched coda nods to a song about a different sort of habit). The almost-title-track “Today More Than Any Other Day” puts that transformative theory into even more explicit action: over a slowcore trickle, a dejected Beeler mutters the dispiriting line “we’re sinking deeper”—but then repeats those words over and over as the song accelerates until his ennui is reborn as exhilaration. And as the song hits its joyously frantic stride, even the prospect of going grocery shopping is elevated to a near-religious experience: “Today more than other day/ I am prepared/ To make the decision/ Between 2 per cent and whole milk,” Beeler shares, fully aware that the concept of choice in a late-capitalist economy is an inherently flawed one. But for him, even such small victories can provide one with the motivation to achieve much greater ones.\nWith his sardonic, conversational style and ticking-time-bomb outbursts, Beeler belongs to a lineage of brainiac-maniacs that span the likes of David Byrne and the Violent Femmes’ Gordan Gano to modern-day rant-rockers like Parquet Courts and Protomartyr. Likewise, the band’s sound encompasses myriad eras and permutations of proto- and post-punk: Velvet Underground drones (via the omnipersent hum of keyboardist Matt May), Feelies speed-jangle, daydreamy Sonic Youthian sprawl. And with the gritty grooves of “Pleasant Heart” and “Around Again”, bassist Ben Stidworthy and drummer Tim Keen display an amazingly deft, Fugazi-like facility with injecting a little funk into their punk without turning it into punk-funk.\nBut more so than any identifiable influence, More Than Any Other Day is ultimately defined by its unsettled, restless spirit; this is an album that treats panic attacks and adrenalized ecstasy as two sides of the same pounding heart, with its simultaneous transmissions of joy and fear, discipline and chaos, comedy and tragedy. As Beeler spells it out in the album’s thrillingly combustible closer, “Gemini”: “I retain the right to be disgusted by life/ I retain the right to be in love with everything in sight.” Though born of a highly politicized protest movement, Ought aren’t telling you what to do with your life. They just want to make sure you live it.",

        "article_text": "In 2003, writer Steve Goodman, now known to keyed-in music nerds as the producer Kode9, was interviewing Kevin Martin, the mastermind behind the bombed-out dub project the Bug, for dance publication XLR8R. The conversation turned to dubstep, the roots of which were just starting to take hold in London; Martin heard a track of Goodman’s, who was just then cutting his teeth as a producer, and he encouraged him to start a label to release it, promising to help find a distributor. Less than a year later came HYP001, “Sign of the Dub” b/w “Stalker”, a collaborative release between Kode9 and UK rapper Spaceape (then credited as Daddy Gee).\nFor Hyperdub’s first four years, the label moved carefully when it came to releases. Most of their output from 2004–2006 was credited to Goodman and Spaceape, including the duo’s debut LP Memories of the Future, but they also worked with some guy named William Bevan, whose self-titled debut LP as Burial came in 2006, a year after Goodman put out the project’s wobbly first 12“, South London Boroughs. Burial was a modest record that initially attracted curiosity more than it did accolades, but in 2007 Bevan returned with the excellent Ghost Hardware 12” and the instant classic Untrue, a record that came to define dubstep for legions of new listeners seven years before Merriam Webster decided to define it themselves.\nOne of the most influential electronic records  in recent memory, Untrue cemented Bevan as one of the decade’s most vital producers and introduced dubstep (more as a concept, less as a sound) to a much wider audience. So you can imagine what its success did for Hyperdub. A brief glance at the label’s chronological catalog resembles a dam about to burst, and Untrue was the low frequency that shook the firmament to the point of collapse. In 2008 came releases from up-and-coming names that, six years later, are familiar to anyone in the know: bass music basket case Zomby, abstracted pop outfit Darkstar (who at that point were working with a more explicitly dance-focused sound), dubstep-gone-freestyle queen Ikonika. Martin’s lover’s rock-focused King Midas Sound project even put out their first release for the label that year.\nHyperdub marked their fifth anniversary in 2009, but despite a half-decade of existence, the label’s creative surge had kicked into high gear only two years previous. So the excellent 5 Years of Hyperdub was as much an overview of where Hyperdub had been as it was a chance to draw on the increased exposure electronic music was receiving and define something approaching a “scene.” Ace cuts from Los Angeles hip-hop auteur Flying Lotus, Dutch dance producer Martyn, and dub-as-fuck mad scientist Mala appeared alongside catalog highlights from label regulars Kode9, LV, and yes, Burial.\n5 Years of Hyperdub was the culmination of a series of five 12\" releases collecting label highlights—5.1, 5.2, you get the idea—and the expanded approach Hyperdub’s taken to that concept for their 10-year anniversary is indicative of how quickly Goodman’s label has grown, both in size and influence. 10.1 is a two-CD set—the first in the series, no less—with one disc collecting tracks from the label’s last five years and one with entirely new material. Each compilation will have a theme, and 10.1 turns its focus towards dancefloor-centered cuts, so those waiting for a collection of Hyperdub’s stranger entries might have to wait a little longer.\nThat said, 10.1 is more proof that Hyperdub can’t help but embrace left-of-center even as it focuses on club fare. This is far from a bad thing: Hyperdub’s released some of the most appealingly odd and oddly prescient electronic music of the last 15 years, and the glaring omissions from this volume’s disc of catalog cuts—Terror Danjah’s fiery grime tune “Acid” from 2010, Ossie’s bubbly UK Funky cut “Set the Tone” from 2011, the jagged piano-house of Laurel Halo’s “Throw”, from last years Behind the Green Door EP—only serve to highlight the wealth of material the label has released.\nDance music label comps serve a dual purpose: 1) provide an accessible way for non-collectors to obtain material that might’ve received limited release; 2) offer labels a way to define their legacy or current position in the music landscape. 10.1 fulfills the first function simply by existing, and effectively flips two middle fingers towards the second. One of the most intriguing elements of Hyperdub’s output is its sheer unpredictability and refusal of easy categorization. The closest thing to dubstep proper on the first disc is Burial and Spaceape’s Burial cut “Spaceape”, an obvious nod to Hyperdub’s humble beginnings; from there, we’re hit with variations on the breezy skip of Funky (Funkystepz’s “Hurricane Riddim”, Ill Blu’s “Clapper”), 8-bit fantasias (Ikonika’s “Idiot”, Walton’s “Aggy”), low-slung hip-hop (Mark Pritchard and Om’mas Keith’s “Wind It Up”), and effervescent grime (Kode9’s “Xingfu Lu”).\nIn addition to shining a light on the difficulty of categorizing Hyperdub, the old-stuff collection is further proof that the label’s vision is always trained forward. Appearances from regulars Ikonika and Cooly G are a reminder that, along with Laurel Halo and Canadian techno-pop architect Jessy Lanza, Hyperdub’s been one of the few of-the-moment dance labels to consistently showcase female artists. Stylistically, they’ve also found themselves ahead of the curve: Morgan Zarate’s as-of-yet-underappreciated “Hookid”, from 2011, is a tangled sigh of staircase tones, phased-out bass hits, and cascading synths ripped from Southern U.S. hip-hop. At the time, it was a curiosity; in 2014, it sounds like a trap precedent, if that sound’s basic elements were scrambled in a blender and poured all over some poor sap’s kitchen counter.\nThe new-stuff disc offers few hints as to where the label is headed next, which is unsurprising, but the variety on display is only matched by the quality of the tunes themselves. Detroit techno fiend Kyle Hall’s “Girl U So Strong” builds and breaks with wheezing tones and backbeats, a throaty diva shout occasionally popping up to offer an anchor; Zarate returns with the hard-hitting “Kaytsu”, a track even more explicitly trap than the genre-predicting “Hookid”, while the relatively quiet producer Kuedo (whose 2011 LP Severant still stands as an overlooked gem) returns with a track dubbed after his namesake and sporting his signature Vangelis-meets-Big Tymers style of aural hypnotism. Following the explicit reggae of his Essential Mix from last year, Mala delivers one of his meanest anthems to date with the stomping “Expected”, while Japanese producer and Hyperdub mainstay Quarta330 closes out the disc with the hyper-colorful “Hanabi”.\nThe “what’s to come” section takes up the back half of 10.1’s fresh-jams collection, in the form of a stretch of footwork primarily from the Teklife crew. Footwork continues to gain a greater presence in the electronic world, aided by fellow UK label Planet Mu’s scene-surveying Bangs \u0026 Works compilations and cemented by last year’s classic LP from the late DJ Rashad, Double Cup. Earlier this year, Goodman told The Japan Times that he was drawn to getting involved with the genre by way of Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas: “Mike said to me, ‘Go on, release this stuff, because everyone thinks I’m crazy.’”\nParadinas had a point—footwork in its rawest form can be grating, and the stretch of brown-sound bass hits and repetitive vocal samples that mark the back half of the first disc of 10.1 may lead to a few headaches. But Hyperdub’s embrace of the genre was perfectly timed, and the cuts presented here showcase a scene that is further mutating and innovating as it gains more widespread attention. Taso \u0026 Djunya’s “Only the Strong Survive” pairs footwork’s intense focus with a starry-eyed sense of wonder, DJ Spinn“’s ”All My Teklife“ features synths that glisten so bright they threaten to overpower everything else around them, and DJ Earl’s ”I’m Gonna Get You\" hammers its titular phrase home to the point of aggravation until the sample drops out with a sense of relief before revving up all over again.\nRashad appears posthumously on both discs of 10.1: along with DJ Taye, he had a hand in DJ Earl’s other cut on the new disc, the typically intense “Bombaklot”, and Rashad and Gant-Man further explore Double Cup’s acid techno flirtations on the enjoyable “Acid Life”. He also closes out the disc of catalog highlights—the comp was announced well before Rashad’s sudden and tragic death last month, so this is an unusual occurrence of timing above all else—with the epochal “Let It Go”. A titanic track that could be considered footwork’s own “Strings of Life”, “Let It Go” has a classic, immovable sound, as a lone drum machine kicks things off before meeting up with the endlessly, blissfully repeated vocal sample. Some warped strings enter, and for a second it seems like things are off—“Something doesn’t sound right” is, granted, an understandable reaction to most footwork—but then the vocal sample completes itself with a diva’s cry, “Baaa-by/ Bayyyyyy-beeeeee”, that hits like a gut-punch.\n“Let It Go” was released on March 18, 2013, as part of Rashad’s excellent Rollin’ EP for Hyperdub; a year, one month, and eight days later, he was found dead at his home in Chicago’s West Side. Before his death, I must have personally listened to “Let It Go” at least eight or nine times a week, and every time I put it on, it took me places that only the most impressionistically beautiful pieces of music can go. I’ve listened to it while feeling sad, happy, unsure, frustrated, in love, out of place—basically, it’s music I put on when I want to feel something. After Rashad’s death, the urge to latch onto the track’s more melancholy aspects is there, but every time I reach for “Let It Go”, the flood of emotions remains rich and complex. Rashad touched a lot of people with his visionary, melodic approach to footwork, and the dance community has only begun feeling the effects of his legacy; amidst the incredible collection of tunes on 10.1, “Let It Go” is proof that, even in the ever-changing world of electronic music, it’s possible to create something that sounds absolutely timeless.",

        "article_text": "Will Wiesenfeld wanted his second album as Baths to be nothing short of an out-of-body experience. While creating, producing, and performing Cerulean by himself may have been a declaration of independence at one point, he soon felt trapped and limited behind his MPDs, unable to fully connect with crowds, and mislabeled as a \"DJ.\" More crucially, his physical frame was failing him. Last year, a debilitating bout with E. coli rendered him incapable of eating or getting out of bed, let alone creating new music. After slowly convalescing, he channeled all of these pent-up frustrations and desires-- for escape, for artistic growth, for transformation, for death, for self-actualization-- into Obsidian. And by doing so, he didn’t just create his second album. He made an evil twin.\nWhile Obsidian maintains some aspects of Cerulean, namely, its lap-pop intimacy and Wiesenfelds unsteady, quavering vocals, the shock is in hearing him make a complete heel turn, fearlessly operating like someone absolved of personal repercussion or culpability: He pursues every gnarly musical idea, every perverted lyric. Cerulean gave no indication as to how much range Wiesenfeld could cover working exclusively in purple and pitch black. Over the sickly, chain-gang lurch of “Worsening”, Wiesenfelds weary recitations serve as both an introduction to his newly florid, morbid poetry, and Obsidian’s thesis statement-- “Birth was like a fat black tongue/ Dripping tar and dung and dye/ Slowly into my shivering eyes.\" As to be expected from someone whose body was recently powerless over the most basic functions, Wiesenfeld sees death in everything. Tall rock shelves and an overcast atmosphere are viewed as exits to the afterlife on “Miasma Sky”, an advance single that gave the impression that Baths’ idea of pop was a suicidal version of what the Postal Service do. He can’t prevent himself from being sucked into the ground as the molten, heavy metal banger “Earth Death” creates its own gravitational pull.\nThroughout, the songs on Obsidian are physical in a literal sense, mimicking the human motion of the characters described therein. The collation of disparate layers on “Worsening” is simply astonishing, so many parts going in gawky, arrhythmic directions to form a fearsome, fluid whole. The illicit love affair on “Ironworks” moves to a limpid Satie-like piano figure of incapacitating beauty, containing all the sadness, longing, and tenderness the two feel for each other. Meanwhile, the stunning breadth of Obsidian becomes apparent as “Incompatible” skulks forward, non-quantized rhythms emphasizing the fumbled communication and resentments of an ice-cold relationship. \nThe physicality and darkness aren’t just borne out of a 24-year-old’s first brush with death. Obsidian is in some aspect a “grown up” record in that the characters find themselves in adult situations. But they aren’t mature by any means. In fact, the sexual conduct is fueled by as much nihilism as the apocalyptic conjuring. This is really where Obsidian feels less like a typical artistic “leap” than a bold leap of faith. Vocally, Wisenfeld was a bit player on Cerulean, and often would whisper sweet little love notes: “Please tell me you need me,” “I still smell you, distance aside.” On “Ironworks,” he likens himself to “Sweet swine/ In Victorian doorways/ In tempestuous foreplay,” and that’s as cute as things get.\nOtherwise, it’s brutal stuff: anonymous sex is pursued and consummated in a manner as merciless and cold as the mechanical animal beat of “No Eyes”: “It is not a matter of if you mean it/ But it is only a matter of come and fuck me.” Even more unsettling is “Incompatible”, which is of a piece with “No Eyes”, the same poisonous self-seeking and carnal misconduct brought much closer to home. Wiesenfeld deftly sets the scene by utilizing the connotations embedded in the unflattering aspects of cohabitation-- a shared toilet seat, an unmade bed with “covers in divisive heaps.” From there on out, he plays a manipulative, abusive, loveless lover where the sexual demands (“Nights you roll over and introduce yourself/ Nurse this erection back to full health”) are somehow less cruel than the gutwrenching asides you might hear at the dinner table: “You don’t do anything with your life /I could prod your hurt all night.” While the narrator admits, “I was never poetic and I was never kind,” only half rings true for Wiesenfeld.\nThese wouldn’t be shocking lyrics within the catalogs of Xiu Xiu or Perfume Genius, who, if not peers, are certainly precedents for the immersive, ornate, and homoerotic songwriting Baths engages in here. But provocation is a main goal for Jamie Stewart and Mike Hadreas, who maintain deadly serious and combative personae on and off-record; they push buttons and boundaries, but in doing so, they allow their work and its subject matter to be considered “outsider art,” easily spotted and easily avoided. Though Wiesenfeld is very open and candid about his sexuality, the predominant image he’s cast is that of a constantly smiling, muttonchopped young man who gushes about anime and Skyrim on Twitter. In that sense, the gregarious and genial Wiesenfeld has created a more subversive work by getting uncomfortably close to pop, confronting closed minds with what they don’t want to believe-- that the supposedly impure or deviant behavior described in “No Eyes” or “Incompatible” or “Ironworks” isn’t relegated to any race, class, gender, or sexual orientation, that it can’t be simply ignored or pinned on the outwardly misanthropic. Whether it’s repressed or engaged with as powerfully as it is on Obsidian, the dark matter lives inside all of us. If you hear Obsidian and think, “I didn’t know he had it in him,” what sticks is how he makes you wonder if you have “it” in you as well.",

        "article_text": "Swans were hardly the first 1980s underground-rock fixtures to resurface in the new millennium, and they’re not the only ones whove resisted the nostalgic trappings of reunion tours to make a respectable showing as a rebooted recording act. But they are the rare band of their vintage who seem less concerned with living up to or building upon a past legacy than establishing a completely different one. In retrospect, the 14 years that elapsed between 1996’s Soundtracks for the Blind and 2010’s My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky were less a break-up-induced hiatus than a gestation period. The bigger, brawnier Swans that Michael Gira has assembled in its wake (complete with a strapping, bare-chested gong-smasher named Thor) are beholden neither to the primordial, industrialized sludge of the band’s infamous ’80s catalogue nor the post-goth serenity of their ’90s work. Instead, they’ve perfected a new means of transforming grostequerie into grandeur and vice versa.\nWith 2012’s astonishingly colossal The Seer, Swans pulled off the unlikeliest of coups: A record that, over its six sides and two-hour-plus running time, was seemingly designed to test the commitment of the band’s most ardent followers yet, amazingly, expanded their audience to an unprecedented degree. (This summer, Swans are even playing the odd free festival date in outdoor public squares, which could conceivably earn them a few new fans in the grandparents-and-strollers demographic.) But while Swans have always been the last band to pander to audience expectations, Gira nonetheless seems aware that anticipation for a new Swans album has arguably never been greater. And so he’s responded in the best way possible: by producing a record that, in structure and scale, is every bit The Seer’s equal, yet possessed by a peculiar energy and spirit that proves all the more alluring in its dark majesty.\nThe relationship between the two albums can essentially be gauged by their respective album covers. Though there’s a similarity in composition, To Be Kind’s artwork trades The Seer’s dark shadows for a bright mustard tone, and the central feral-dog figure for cute baby faces (as rendered in a series of six by L.A. painter Bob Biggs), suggesting a more approachable ethos at play. But as any new parent can tell you, an infant is as volatile and destructive a creature as the wildest of field animals and, likewise, the John Congleton-produced To Be Kind boasts a more focused attack—with a preminum on taut, throbbing grooves and blackened blues—that initially tricks you into thinking its more accessible than its predecessor. (Hey, theres even a song named in honour of Kirsten Dunst.) Yet it’s ultimately accessible in the same way a prison gate is accessible—getting in is relatively easy; getting out unscathed is an entirely different story. Upon hearing the introductory Cajun-funk strut of “A Little God in My Hands”, I initially worried that Swans were crossing over into the sort of campy, Southern-fried creepiness you’d hear on the soundtrack to an episode of \"True Blood\". But after that destabilizing blast of brass and synapse-frying synth beam appears out of nowhere at the 90 second mark, “A Little God in My Hands” carries on as if infected by a virus; it tries to keep its cool, but the once-sprightly rhythmic bounce is now ridden with a nervous tension, while the encroaching chorus of dead-eyed female voices transform the song into a mutant-zombie version of its former self. On To Be Kind, this is what constitutes a lead single.\nClose observers of Swans will notice that seven of the 10 songs here were previewed in some form on last year’s limited-edition concert album/demos collection Not Here/Not Now (whose sales funded the new album’s production). But most have since been subjected to dramatic embellishment or rearrangement. Not Here/Not Now’s tense, acoustic-strummed closing sketch “Screen Shot” has been recast as To Be Kind’s louche, slow-boiling “Yoo Doo Right”-styled opener and, in the process, illuminates the great contradiction at the core of the 21st-century Swans sound: as their sonic vocabulary has grown more elaborate and texturally detailed, Gira’s sense of melody has turned all the more minimalist and mantric. Thirty years ago on the deadpan dirge, “Job”, Gira sang from the perspective of the world’s most bored axe murderer (“Cut off the arms/ Cut off the legs/ Cut off the head/ Get rid of the body”) as a metaphor for soul-destroying, day-to-day workplace drudgery; on “Screen Shot,” he more eagerly sings of a different sort of dismemberment  (“No touch/ No loss/ No hands/ No sin”), of purging urges—and the body parts used to indulge them—as way to achieve a state of spiritual purity.\nThe ensuing songs on To Be Kind present variations on this theme—of unleashing an outsized sound to find an inner peace, and reclaiming ones innocence by way of insolence. But, of course, this being a Swans record, salvation never comes easy. When, amid the “Dirt”-covered funereal march of “I’m Just a Little Boy” Gira pleads, “I need loooooooooooove,” he’s answered by a Greek chorus of devious, derisive laughter. (Of all the terrible, humiliating experiences detailed in Swans songs over the years, that moment just might count as the cruelest.) And if the 34-minute centerpiece “Bring the Sun”/“Toussaint L’Ouverture” initially summons our planet’s primary life-source with all the trance-inducing elation and desperation of a remote-island pagan sect praying to their gods for a bountiful harvest, its more sinister second act—wherein Gira maniacally howls the name of the titular 18th-century Haitian revolutionary while drowning in a swamp of dub spewage—transforms the track into an after-hours seance gone wrong.\nAs it plays out, To Be Kind starts to resemble a cult procession unto itself, a mesmerizing spectacle of an omnipotent band whose sound continues to expand in scope and ranks swell in size. Much like The Seer, To Be Kind sees a formidable and evermore prominent coterie of female vocalists—from the insurgent Cold Specks to reigning freak-scene queen St. Vincent to avant-rock veteran Little Annie—falling under Swans’ sway. And rather than provide a calming counterpoint to Gira’s stentorian croon, their voices ultimately serve the album’s hypnotic force. From the teeth-gnashing ferocity of “Oxygen” to the calamitous, battering-rammed climax of “She Loves Us!”, To Be Kind adheres to a policy of transcendence by any means necessary, even if it means repeatedly bashing you in the face with a mallet until you’re seeing stars and colors.\nOn the hymn-like title-track closer, Gira solemnly repeats the words “to be kind” as both an aspirational self-help slogan and a tacit acknowledgement that, given all the diabolically orchestrated malevolence we’ve been subjected to over the preceding 112 minutes, he hasn’t always done the best job of heeding his own advice. But as the song violently erupts into one final, sustained surge of tectonic-plate-shifting discord, the moment proves to be as affirming as it is unsettling. “People always consider us to be very dour and depressing, but fuck that shit,” Gira told Pitchfork’s Brandon Stosuy in 2012. “The goal is ecstasy.” And what makes To Be Kind so compelling is how that goal seems both fully realized yet forever out of reach at the same time. ",

        "article_text": "Frank Ocean is airborne, looking around, taking it all in. \"Up above the birds, I saw the sky like I never seen before,\" he whispers on his major-label debut, Channel Orange, as avian chirps surround him. \"You thought I was above you.\" The 24-year-old has quickly proven himself to be among the most gifted singer-songwriters of his generation; hes got the type of voice, wit, charm, smarts, and ineffable humanity thats always hoped for, but never promised. And hes got every reason to think hes above the vividly realized lost souls that slouch, preen, and weep throughout his album. But thats not how Frank Ocean works. His lofty gaze is powerful, but not all-powerful. \"Whats a god to a non-believer who dont believe in anything?\" he sang on Watch the Thrones \"No Church in the Wild\". Hes so good at questioning that answers cant help but bubble up in the wake of his words. \nAlong with Oceans empathy for his characters is a sense of repose-- hes been there, hes weathered it, and hes come away with his Zen-like calm intact. On Channel Orange, this serene deadpan is splashed with crackling emotion, as though hes alternately narrating and starring in his own Magnolia-style cross-wired-heartbreak epic. Its all there on proper opener \"Thinkin Bout You\", where he battles his own brain while reminiscing about a first love. He tells himself white lies in the verse before flipping to a falsetto that could make DAngelo sweat for the endless wound of a chorus: \"Do you not think so far ahead?/ Cause Ive been thinkin bout forever.\" \nWhen Ocean dropped an early take of \"Thinkin Bout You\" on his Tumblr last summer, it was quickly followed by a version from perfectly competent Roc Nation signee Bridget Kelly, who claimed Ocean originally wrote the song for her. The fact that Oceans take dwarfs Kellys both artistically as well as in terms of popularity is telling. After languishing as a behind-the-scenes writer for pop stars including Brandy, John Legend, and Justin Bieber, with \"Thinkin Bout You\" Ocean doubled down on the out-of-nowhere success of his unique and brilliant 2011 mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra., marking his territory as a performer in his own right. And while hes now primarily writing songs for himself, his time toiling in L.A. studios gave him the experience to create a piece as accomplished and varied as Channel Orange, which swings from Stevie-style keyboard breeziness to 1990s bap\u0026B to mystic psych rock to crunching 8-bit funk without thinking twice.\nThe \"Thinkin Bout You\" mix-up was telling for another reason, too. As written, its by-and-large a unisex composition, and the line, \"my eyes dont shed tears, but boy they pour when Im thinkin bout you,\" didnt seem especially revealing since Ocean wrote the song for a woman. In light of the letter he published earlier this month, in which he stated that his first love, at age 19, was with a man, that line-- and others on the album-- gains some personal and historical context. For a culture that accurately prides itself on sonic progression, hip-hop and R\u0026B can be woefully conservative when it comes to sexuality. This is changing, and Frank Ocean is helping it to change, and if his revelation inspires others to understand themselves or the world more fully, then that could be one of Channel Oranges finest legacies. But it will not be the albums only legacy.\nAside from its bravery, Oceans letter was, in itself, stunningly written. Its beautiful ambiguities had people reacting with sensational headlines, and then amending those sensational headlines, and then thinking about how and why they personally reacted to such sensational headlines. More questions; more answers. After realizing he was in love with a man, Ocean \"reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager. the ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak.\" And, whether consciously or not, Channel Oranges language is admirably-- and skillfully-- inclusive. Rather than getting listeners to comb through the lyrics for certain words or references, Ocean mixes things up so well-- and coats the entire affair with heavy doses of disorienting surreality-- that petty pronoun policing is rendered completely useless as deeper meanings reveal themselves at the same time. \nWhile pop is currently in the golden age of exacting self-reflection-- an often beguiling phenomenon spurred on by the internets infinite mirror-- Ocean is interested in a more selfless pursuit. \"As a lifestyle, you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy,\" Ocean recently told The New York Times. \"I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though its my voice, Im a storyteller.\" Those tales are as wide-ranging as they are engrossing, always benefitting from Oceans eye for detail and specificity. There are sly California class observations in the vein of Joan Didion or Randy Newman, where latchkey \"Super Rich Kids\" cant see past their own one-percent \"Sweet Life\". But once again, Ocean isnt just sniping easy targets; \"why see the world when you got the beach?\" he asks, a Rorschach test of a hook that leaves its levels of bliss or cynicism wholly up to the listener. \nThere are plenty of addicts on the back half of the album: the fiend at the center of \"Crack Rock\" whose family \"stopped inviting you to things\" and \"wont let you hold their infant,\" or the poisoned relationship between a dealer and his mule on \"Lost\". On the records most harrowing cut, \"Bad Religion\", Ocean is crippled by love and left searching for lifes answers in the back of a cab-- the string-bleeding ballad finds the singer offering his most impassioned plea yet: \"This unrequited love/ To me its nothing but a one man cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup/ I could never make him love me.\"\nWhile Channel Orange is stuffed with one-of-a-kind details and characters, its overall scope is grand, as is Oceans. Tape-hiss interludes bind these very hi-fi songs together with a musty analog quality, and a couple of tracks seem to end mid-sentence, leaving you no choice but to keep going. And theres a timeless philosophy involved here, one of hard-won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them. How else to explain \"Pyramids\", a 10-minute time warp that goes from ancient Egyptian wonders to modern strip clubs and essentially reincarnates one of the most storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. But still, the song doesnt read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field. \n\"holding my head. keeping it g [...] whatever keeping it g means to me. ive sorta zoned in on my own definition.\" Frank wrote that on December 27, 2011-- the same day he wrote the \"first love\" letter he published last week. Both missives, along with Channel Orange itself, carry the same spirit of confident, open-minded redefinition; hes living in his own world, but also fascinated with whats around him. Currently, his Twitter bio reads: \"i dont know anything. \u0026 neither do you.\" In Frank Ocean-speak, thats not a statement of ignorance but rather one of wisdom.",

        "article_text": "\"At every occasion, Im ready for a funeral.\"\nIn the year between my fathers diagnosis with cancer and his death, I dreaded the telephone. Whenever it rang, I jumped. Picking it up with a trepidant hand, I tried to quickly discern the callers tone of voice, fearing the worst news. Whether intentionally or not, the line quoted above, from Band of Horses debut album, Everything All the Time, perfectly evokes that particular anxiety. Its a sad line for any song, but Band of Horses singer Ben Bridwells delivery isnt mopey or self-absorbed-- there are no intimate acoustic guitars or whispery male vocals accompanying these words. Instead, he belts them over soaring guitars and extroverted chords, all tempered with a stoicism that staves off histrionics. Turning despondency into indie majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for personal projection.\nMore elemental than the lush dream-pop of Bridwell and Mat Brookes former band Carissas Wierd (the duo played all the instruments here before fleshing out the band with backing musicians), Band of Horses sound will be immediately, invitingly familiar to anyone who reads this site regularly. Their guitar-heavy sound and Bridwells echo-y vocals invite specific comparisons to labelmates the Shins as well as My Morning Jacket, and more general similarities can be noted with forebears such as Neil Young and the Ocean Blue. While apt, these comparisons seem restrictive and reductive, but their limitations can be illuminating. On quieter songs such as \"St. Augustine\", Bridwell recalls Jim James reverb-heavy vocals, but he lacks the defining regional drawl; as a result, Band of Horses seem placeless. Where the Shins coil their songs tightly to spring out at the choruses, Bridwell and Brookes tracks sprawl languorously-- more atmospheric than hooky, but nevertheless too structured and targeted to be considered jammy.\nBand of Horses alternately lucid and obscure songwriting remains life-size, even as their guitars swell beyond the everyday. Album centerpiece \"The Great Salt Lake\" begins with a jangly guitar that suggests early R.E.M., lying low to the ground during the verses until the chorus takes off. They also successfully work that contrast between earthbound and airborne on \"The Funeral\" and \"Monsters\", with its rickety banjo carving a rough path for a climactic finale.\nOf course, if all of Everything strove for such catharsis, the repetition of builds and releases would become tedious and cheap. Wisely, Band of Horses show off a much broader dynamic, peppering the album with rangier numbers like \"The First Song\" and the churning, catchy \"Wicked Gil\". \"Weed Party\", the albums most upbeat track, even begins with what sounds like a spontaneous and genially goofy \"yeee-haw!\" Still, every element and track on Everything contributes to the albums wistful, twilit atmosphere, from its first cascading guitar chords to its final rueful strums. And instead of closing with the slow crescendo of \"Monsters\", they go out on a quieter note with \"St. Augustine\", a gently ebbing tune featuring both Horses singing together, Bridwells higher-pitched voice anchored by Brookes low whisper. So the albums not as grim as that introductory quotation would imply; the bands downheartedness is always offset by a sense of hope. As Bridwell sings on \"Monsters\", \"If I am lost its only for a little while.\"\nThough Band of Horses arent likely to be heralded as trailblazers, they do sound quietly innovative and genuinely refreshing over the course of these 10 sweeping, heart-on-sleeve anthems. Ultimately, the bands most winning trait is its delicate balance of elements-- between gloom and promise, quiet and loud, epic and ordinary, familiar and new, direct and elliptical, artist and listener. Each of these aspects makes the others sound stronger and more complex, making Everything All the Time an album thats easy to get lost in and even easier to love.\n ",

        "article_text": "Before their rich, sad new album Atlas, it would have been difficult to imagine the Real Estate song youd turn to in a time of crisis. “Suburban Beverage”? “Let’s Rock the Beach?” The New Jersey bands first two albums were simply not places to which you brought problems—they were escapist havens, Tiki-torch grottos leading you away from your worries and gently towards the pool raft. The lyrics, meanwhile, were mantras best understood with a beer koozie gripped in one hand: What you want is just beyond your reach; keep on trying. Whoah, its real. Budweiser, Sprite.\nOn Atlas, their basic sound hasnt changed—frontman Martin Courtneys clean-strummed open chords, Matt Mondaniles bright leads, and a light-stepping rhythm section all squish together comfortably like college housemates sprawled on a sectional sofa—but the mood has. \"Im just trying to make some sense of this before I lose another year,\" shrugs Courtney on \"The Bend”. On \"Crime\", he sings \"Toss and turn all night, dont know how to make this right/ Crippling anxiety.\" The once-ideal pool party band, in other words, has turned to soundtracking the cleanup: Everyones gone, the skys threatening rain, there are cigarette butts floating in the pool, and weve all gotta work tomorrow.\nThe result is at once their most forlorn album and their most beautiful. Producer and mixer Tom Schick dissolves the noncommittal haze of reverb that made it sound like you were hearing Days through a fisheye lens, and the crispness that emerges on Atlas is gorgeous. Courtney’s tenor is soft and even, and the room tone is bruised-ripe like an October sunset. In this soft light, the band sounds like the platonic ideal of themselves, and it’s difficult not to wish all their albums had been recorded this way.\nThe clarity of Atlas underlines what an uncommonly graceful unit they are. Real Estate essentially has two lead vocalists—Courtney’s tenor on the one hand, and Mondanile’s pearly guitar melodies on the other. The two voices enjoy a near-telepathic relationship, and it’s almost impossible to imagine Courtney’s singing without Mondanile’s guitar twirling around it, and vice versa. As the tabbed tutorial they posted for “Crime” underlines, nothing anyone is playing would tax a first-year guitar student. But their two voices, working modestly and in perfect sync, key into a mysterious and powerful emotional calculus. When the bell-clear leads rise out of on \"The Bend\" and\"Navigator\", they feel like spontaneously welling tears.\nThis simplicity and eloquence is the key to Atlas’ surprisingly profound ache. Courtney’s words tend to mention the same things over and over—the sky, the horizon, the sidewalk, the houses on his block—but he’s not repeating himself. He’s shaping the contours of a world, one thats built on a sense of cosmic gratitude matched by an equal and opposite sense of cosmic loss. “I don’t need the horizon/ To tell me where the sky ends/ And it’s a subtle landscape/ Where I come from,” he sings on “Had to Hear”. “Just over the horizon/ That’s where I always think you’ll be/ It’s always so surprising/ To find you right there next to me,” he sings tenderly on “Horizon”. The bittersweet disorientation of these two competing thoughts—I’ve lost more than I’ll ever know, I have more than I ever imagined—mark out a very particular phase of life, and it’s one Courtney is currently in the throes of: He’s about to have his first child.\nThis is a life moment when you engage in a little less dreamy reverie about who you might be, and begin assessing, with some alarm, who you have already become. If you’re lucky, like Courtney, you are roughly pleased with what you find, even as you squint bewildered into the recent past to mark the notch where the transition happened. “I remember when/ This all felt like pretend/ And I still can’t believe,” he marvels on “Crime”. “I’m staring at the hands on the clock/ I’m still waiting for them to stop” he sings on “Navigator”, the album’s final song and one of many bemused meditations on the passing of time. Real Estate have weathered some jam-band comparisons, and Alex Bleeker is an avowed fan of the Grateful Dead, so it feels like a permissible stretch to note that the shadow of a very particular Dead song—the wry, valedictory “Touch of Grey”—seems to hover over Atlas. Like that song, Atlas assesses the current moment, and everything leading up to it, with a puzzled head scratch and shit-eating grin.\nReal Estate are a deeply suburban band, and the shade of long tree-lined streets, the lonely symmetry of the houses, rise up continually out of their music. If it has been too easy to underestimate Real Estate in the past, it might be in part because of this: Suburbs are not often stages, in the popular imagination, for great existential drama. They are places of reverie, of absence, into which the drama of the real-world intrudes. But Atlas gazes calmly and wisely into the face of some troubling questions: Mortality, the passing of time, the problem of loneliness. With it, Real Estate have made more than just their third excellent record in a row, more than just their best-ever record. They’ve made the first record of their career that feels like it might teach you something over time. It is rare, and special, for a band to be this effortlessly and completely themselves. ",

        "article_text": "“Ode to Viceroy”, Mac DeMarco’s sun-dappled tribute to cheap cigs from his 2012 album 2, hasn’t lost its smolder. It’s probably the Brooklyn-via-Montreal singer and songwriter’s best-known tune—a laid-back guitar-pop daydream, as wobbly and welcoming as a backyard hammock—and it captures a lot of his music’s appeal. “Viceroy” is about taking pleasure in something that could kill you, and the lethal paradox is part of the draw. Somewhere in retirement, Joe Camel must be kicking himself. \nThis alluring ambivalence is one of DeMarco’s defining traits. He’s the gap-toothed prankster who sings the sighing love ballad. He’s the guy everybody assumes is a stoner, though he claims he never, as they say, touches the stuff. You can’t read about him without seeing the word “slacker,” but in two short years, he’s gone from opening at New York’s 550-capacity Bowery Ballroom to headlining at the 1,500-capacity Webster Hall (could he have done better if he’d tried?). The fact DeMarco isn’t even his real name—he was born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV—captures the duality almost too perfectly. \nWhichever Mac is the better-behaved one has been taking over more and more, as the creepy detours of 2012’s Rock and Roll Night Club EP gave way to the more direct 2. His second full-length, Salad Days, isn’t a departure from its predecessor so much as a richer, increasingly assured refinement. For all its internal contradictions, Salad Days is no more or less than a great album in a tradition of no-big-deal great albums.\nThere’s little here to justify DeMarco’s reputation for divisiveness (“Detractors,” as Steven Hyden put it for Wondering Sound, “tend to regard him as some kind of bullshit artist, a quintessential hipster doofus slumming it under the ironic guise of a hippie dirtbag who gleefully covers Limp Bizkit in concert”). The loping “Blue Boy”, which shares its title with an indie-pop classic by Orange Juice, amiably advises against acting so tough and worrying so much about your haircut. The warm, watery groove of “Brother” recalls the Beatles’ “Don’t Let Me Down”, though its moony lyrical sentiment (“You’re no better off living your life than dreaming at night”) might be more “I’m Only Sleeping”. You’re unlikely to hear a supposedly hip album this year with so many mentions of people’s mothers.\nAs with Real Estate’s Atlas, DeMarco’s new album is also ostensibly one where the chill bro gets all mature and stuff, and here his inner conflicts return with a suitably nonchalant vengeance. The title track undercuts its narrator’s worries about aging by alluding to the inconvenient truth that the worrier is only 23—not exactly ready for that condo in Florida. Relatedly, anyone hoping for a pot anthem in organ-thick “Passing Out the Pieces” will instead find a koan-like complaint about the artist life’s crummy trade-offs. Penultimate “Go Easy” suggests concern for the girlfriend left behind while on tour, but its lyrical non sequitur—“You built it up, just to knock it down”—is a common criticism of the music press that has received DeMarco so favorably and could speak to his uneasy relationship with success. Et tu, Vernor?\nIt’s telling that Salad Days most immediate song, the one with biggest chance of transcending DeMarco’s cult, is one he says he didn’t want to do. “Let Her Go” was apparently the answer to label Captured Tracks’ demands for “an upbeat single” suitable for late-night TV, and DeMarco is still upset about it. He shouldn’t be: It’s an outstanding crystallization of his gifts, the real-talk advice of Jonathan Richman with a far more accessible poetic dreaminess. Of course, even this reversal of the hoary “if you love her, let her go” chestnut undermines its own advice—“Or you can keep her, it’s OK, it’s up to you,” DeMarco counters in a speak-singing outro. It’s only fitting that stick-with-the-girl songs “Let My Baby Stay” and “Treat Her Better” are almost as tunefully plush.\nIn this context, DeMarco’s non-album antics start to look like another defense mechanism, another way of cutting himself off at the legs before someone else does it for him. That Limp Bizkit rendition showed up as part of a jokey 2013 live release; DeMarco has been vocal about how tiresome that novelty-cover setlist (Metallica, the Police, blah blah blah) became. And he previewed Salad Days with a video for a puckish perv-pop outtake centering on a refrain of “give me pussy.” So while his slack-not-slack aesthetic may point toward rising peers like Australia’s Courtney Barnett, there’s also ample reason Odd Future lightning rod Tyler, the Creator, who cited this album’s synth-dripping “Chamber of Reflections” as DeMarco’s best song, is a fan.\n\"Chamber of Reflections\" is something like Beach Houses “Heart of Chambers”, but evoking a bare, cell-like apartment rather than a misty opium-den boudoir. It’s DeMarco’s most atmospherically exploratory track yet, and it’s also painfully lonely and quietly eloquent about the experience. So when, at the end of Salad Days airy instrumental finale, “Jonny’s Odyssey”, he remarks, “Thanks for joining me, see you again soon, buh-bye,” you don’t wonder if you’re missing some April Fool’s joke. You want to offer the guy a light, and then you realize he already has plenty.",

        "article_text": "Natalie Prass is not history ripped from a black-and-white photo, but a real, living person. She crafts slow-burning soul music indebted to singers like Dolly Parton, Dusty Springfield, and Jenny Lewis (with whom she toured as a backing vocalist), and she makes her home in Nashville, where she settled after stints in Cleveland, Virginia Beach, and Boston’s Berklee College of Music. (She dropped out after only a year because she thought the city was too big.) In Richmond, Va., she found her people at Spacebomb Records, the label run by retro revivalist and high school friend Matthew E. White. He and producer Trey Pollard hooked her up with the Spacebomb house band, and helped craft her debut album, Natalie Prass, around luxuriant string-and-horn-heavy instrumentation to give her smoldering perspective on passionate romance some pomp and circumstance.\nWhen the album opens, Prass is telling us she doesn’t feel much, which would sound more like a joke if her voice didnt sound so somber. Natalie Prass is an album of relationships troubled by misunderstandings, of earnest lovers caught in the claws of the unmerciful. She sounds lighter than air as she sings lyrics devastating in their economy, addressing someone who \"plucked me from the vine\" on \"Bird of Prey\" and later telling someone else (or the same person?) \"I just want to know you violently\" on \"Violently\". The latter reminds me of Sharon Van Etten’s \"Your Love Is Killing Me\"—the songs even share a similar lyric about having their legs broken so they won’t walk to someone all wrong for them. (Yikes!)\nBut Prass sounds positively uplifted as the band swells over her lovesick harmonies, forgoing any tortured abnegation. There’s idealism in her voice that’s tempered by heartbreak without falling prey to cynicism—like the bitterness has been skimmed off the top, leaving an evergreen sweetness. In an interview with Grantland, Prass said the record was completed in early 2012. \"Violently\" dates as far back as 2009, when she was still in college. What’s remarkable is how the songwriting coheres into one vision, even as Prass herself must’ve changed over the years. Recently, Run the Jewels participated in Rookie’s \"Ask a Grown Man\" video series, where they doled out advice on life and love to teenage girls. During one question, Killer Mike said that love should feel good—that it shouldn’t hurt. Fine advice for hormonal romantics just starting out, but anyone with an ounce of life experience knows it doesn’t work that way.\nNatalie Prass is officially the work of nearly three-dozen musicians, most of whom played horns or strings for Spacebomb’s house band. (Prass has called the record \"a community.\") The arrangements were handled by White and Pollard, and they’re crucial. Without those horns and strings, the repeated refrain of \"our love is a long goodbye\" toward the end of \"My Baby Don’t Understand Me\" wouldn’t percolate to a rolling boil before exploding in that final, devastating delivery. Still, it would be unwise to think that any old singer-songwriter would work with this band behind them. What makes Natalie Prass is her confident delivery amidst so many unconfident feelings—the way she nimbly skips over the verses on \"Bird of Prey\", or walks along the groove on \"Why Don’t You Believe in Me\". She sounds comfortable and in charge, wielding her massive band like a wizard’s scepter.\nPrass is most impressive working within the biggest instrumentation, where her emotional precision acts as a counterweight for all the textural grandiosity. The songs where the drums don’t do the driving, like \"Christy\" or \"It Is You\", raise the question of what the album would sound like were she a more bombastic singer, capable of blowing out speakers. Prass herself seems aware of her limitations. \"I don’t think I’m the most talented musician or the best singer, but I work really, really hard,\" she told Pitchfork. \"And sometimes these random things happen, and it makes you keep going.\" As mantras go, \"I’m not the best but I work really hard\" isn’t the type to get turned into a Tumblr macro, but the result makes Natalie Prass a warm, intimate debut album that leaves space for darker contemplation—those stray thoughts that light you up at the end of the night.",

        "article_text": "The Pains of Being Pure at Heart landed with a bookish and fuzzy aesthetic, the sound of ace indie pop students mimicking their heroes. Yet the band has been forthcoming in their love of crossover alternative rock, and on their second LP, Belong, Pains link up with Flood and Alan Moulder, the superproducers who manned the boards for a number of 90s titans-- Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, U2, Depeche Mode, and PJ Harvey just to name a few. Coming after a scrappy, low-profile debut, this is the sort of power move that used to have cred-conscious listeners crying \"sell-out!\" (remember that word?), but fortunately, Belong is a bigger, bolder, and brighter follow-up that adds new dimensions to the Pains sound while nearly equaling the songwriting of their debut.\nThe first three tracks on Belong-- the title track, \"Heavens Gonna Happen Now\", and \"Heart in Your Heartbreak\"-- make up the strongest run the Pains have put together. Thats in large part because, while they feature the seamless verse-chorus-bridge transitions the debut had in spades, they sound like actual 90s alt-rock radio hits. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart wasnt as lo-fi as it was often made out to be, but it didnt allow for the thrilling deluges of fuzz or the punchy clarity on this opening trio of tracks. Later, Pains nudge themselves slightly out of their comfort zone, replicating the motorbike roar of JAMC on \"Girl of 1,000 Dreams\" or the bliss of My Bloody Valentine on \"Strange\".\nEven with their shiny makeover, the most noticeable alteration is that Kip Berman is no longer just a lead singer-- hes a frontman as well. While maintaining his soft, lisping lilt, hes now much higher in the mix, giving the singalong hooks of \"Heart in Your Heartbreak\" and \"Too Tough\" an underlined emphasis. His lyrics are also more inclusive; hes dropping the puns and arch prose of its predecessor for magnanimous songs about you, we, and us. But this newfound stress on speaking directly to the listener doesnt come without its awkward growth spurts: Its worth questioning whether striving for the perfect chorus at times comes at the cost of fully thought-out verses. The groups momentum also gets occasionally jarred by a stray lyric that can be overreaching or undercooked.\nAnd yet, even the dodgiest lyrics on Belong dont really come off as pandering to me so much as a reminder of the margin for error inherent in a move this brave and necessary. Having dabbled in brighter production and a Saint Etienne remix on their Higher Than the Stars EP, it was evident that the Pains were trying to figure an exit strategy from a narrow, reverent sound they utterly nailed the first time around. And considering the game plans of recent New York bands that faced the same struggle-- either buy time by repeating themselves (like the Strokes or Interpol) or screw the pooch with a charmless, big-budget disaster (like the Strokes or Interpol)-- its no small achievement that Belong transcends its time-coded sound as expertly as their self-titled did.",

        "article_text": "Singer-songwriter Cass McCombs named his fifth album WITS END, not WITS END. The distinction is slight, but telling. Because \"wits\" usually refers to an overall sense of sanity while \"wit\" is more commonly associated with ones cleverness or humor. And this record does not mark the end of McCombs good judgment. Quite the contrary. However, it is not funny or quick or especially nimble-minded. Over the course of his previous four albums, McCombs fashioned himself an enigmatic vagabond in the classic Dylan mold, yet it wasnt until 2009s Catacombs that his enigma started to feel more like a complement than a crutch. While he may have let his wit get the better of him before through knowingly obtuse lyrics and showy arrangements, WITS END fittingly leaves those days behind. This is a gorgeous album of despair, the most believable evidence yet that McCombs is living up to his own legend.\nCatacombs had McCombs stripping away the instrumentation he had built up around his songs, ending with a bare naturalism that suited him well. And WITS END goes even further, its empty spaces and deliberate tempos matching the albums immense loneliness. To get an idea of how desolate, exactly, consider that opening track \"County Line\"-- an inching ballad about severe unrequited love with its own frighteningly real, syringe-filled junkie video-- is the jauntiest thing here. Catacombs highlight \"You Saved My Life\" saw McCombs voicing startling sincere and direct affection; if someone played it at a wedding, grandparents might not blink. The direness of WITS END suggests the California-born singer may need some more saving; if someone played these songs at a funeral, sons and daughters would bow their heads solemnly.\nSo yeah, this record is a downer. But theres rare beauty in such darkness, too-- just look at forebears like Leonard Cohen, Elliott Smith, and Nick Drake. Or even Edgar Allan Poe. Because, along with its mopiness, WITS END is creepy as hell. Its gothic eeriness embodies not Poes famous tales as much as his more ethereal and lovelorn poems. In the authors 1827 verse \"Spirits of the Dead\", he characterizes the titular ghosts as comforting-- \"a mystery of mysteries!\" And that same infatuation with wispy denouements is all over WITS END, but much like Poes spirits, McCombs songs bring life to their withering characters over and over again.\nTake the seven-and-a-half-minute elegy \"Memorys Stain\", in which a shared thrift-store sweater leads to ruminations on the unwashable blots that reside in our subconscious only to pop up without warning. \"Boozing is the highest aim when spittle wont get out Memorys stain,\" he sings, before a breathy bass clarinet takes over for the back half, its unique low tones planting many new memories of its own. And closer \"A Knock Upon the Door\" tells what could be a centuries-old tale of the tumultuous relationship between a minstrel and his creative muse. The songs repetitive verse-upon-verse structure stretches out to nearly ten minutes, but more oddball sounds-- the baroque, recorder-like chalumeau, a metallic dink in place of a snare drum, and the ominous door tap itself-- keep things intriguingly askew. \"The Lonely Doll\", meanwhile, holds its story of a drunken louse and weeping woman aloft over a pillow-y Hammond B3 and brushed drums, the woozy lilt a convincing callback to Leonard Cohens 1967 debut LP.\nIn a handwritten note to Stereogum, McCombs recently wrote, \"I know people get lonely because I do, so thats what I end up writing songs about, how you get lonely sometimes and come up with these big ideas that give you meaning for a second but then leave you like everything else leaves you.\" The statement is economical and accurate, if overly modest. Because while there are lots of musicians trading in loneliness out there, most of them often veer into a self-pity that can leave listeners even more far gone. But the intangibility of WITS END makes it a more realistic and reliable companion, its elusive secrets offering a queer comfort. At the start of his first album, A, Cass McCombs posed the question, \"Is it dying that terrifies you, or just being dead?\" On WITS END, hes come up with an answer; on \"Buried Alive\" he sings, \"If Im alive or dead I dont really care, as long as my Souls intact.\" Hes got soul to spare.",

        "article_text": "For more than 20 years, DJ Quik has been the secret ingredient in the broth. Whether you know it or not, the gifted West Coast producer/rapper has worked on dozens of L.A. gangsta rap classics youve drunkenly screamed along to, often without even a liner-note credit to show for his efforts. Pop musics grumbling cast of neglected innovators is long, but Quik doesnt quite fit with that crowd: Hes released platinum and gold records, as well as helped craft them for Tupac, Snoop, and Dre. Instead, hes stuck in that weird purgatory between Unknown Legend and Not-Quite-Star. Its a situation that could bog you down if you let it. But if you decide, one day, that you simply do not care anymore, something amazing can happen: You realize you can do whatever the hell you want.\nThis realization has been dawning in real time in DJ Quiks music recently. On BlaQKout, his 2009 collaboration with fellow West Coast warrior Kurupt, he experimented with stylistic detours from electro to dub, letting his free-associative musical imagination run wild. On the surface, The Book of David feels more straightforward. A rich stew of warm disco, grown-and-sexy R\u0026B, and classic g-funk, it sounds engineered to waft out over barbecues. But its also riddled with idiosyncrasies: songs that dissolve into deep-dub fade-outs, vocal samples that pop up in unexpected places, astonishing statements of raw heartbreak and anger. Its as weird as it is crowd-pleasing, and it underlines what BlaQKout suggested: Unencumbered by commercial expectations, Quik is making some of the most inventive music of his career.\nQuik has always been quirkier than his gangsta-rap peers-- underneath the monstrous knock of his drums, hes snuck in all manner of odd little details. On The Book of David, though, hes a full-blown mad scientist of trunk-rattle. \"Fire and Brimstone\", the albums opening track, lurches out of the gate with a stumbling drum pattern. Its a pulverizing track that could transform a passing Jeep into a noise-disturbance complaint, but its also a sprawling grid of counter-rhythms oddly similar to the rhythmic map of Radioheads \"Bloom\". (Seriously.) \"Poppin\", meanwhile, feels like a random collection of unrelated sounds accidentally colliding to form a perfectly coherent groove.\nIf any of this sounds wonky or cerebral, dont worry-- The Book of David is a pleasure-first listening experience, and Quik deploys each of his tricks with a showmans flair. \"Hydromatic\" loops an intoxicating vocal sample around some bone-jarring piano stabs and New Orleans brass-band blurts, and thats before the head-spinning syncopated hand-claps glide in. \"Killer Dope\" rolls in on a regal fanfare of French horn pads and jazz-inflected pianos. On that song, Quik brags about his ability to simultaneously rhyme and play his piano live; its a telling boast, revealing the old-school funk producer Quik is in his heart. On The Book of David, you feel his keen musical intelligence-- and his humble pride in his talent-- presiding.\nMost rapper/producers struggle to be as memorable on the mic as they are in the booth, but not Quik. On BlaQKout, he effortlessly lapped frowning technical lyricist Kurupt, and given a sprawling 70-minute album to hold down, he makes for durably fascinating company. His word choices-- meticulous and hilarious-- land somewhere left of your expectations, making him the most vivid presence on each song hes on. \"I got wordplay acumen/ And Ive had it since you was in grade school watchin the janitor vacuumin,\" he informs us on \"Babylon\". When he doles out insults, its with a sense of school-teacherly calm (hes \"a dignitary, youre a lowly beggar,\" he says on \"Fire and Brimstone\"), and even when Quik summons true venom, his voice never rises above the level of casual conversation.\nMost of that venom on The Book of David is directed, as it has been for most of his career, at an intimate place: his own family. \"Ghetto Rendezvous\" (\"I hate you so much it just shows/ I hate you more than Michael hated Joe\") is directed to his own sister, whom he almost did 10 years in prison for pulling a gun on when she allegedly tried to kidnap his children. Its a horrific story, the kind of dirty laundry some rappers would air as a perverse badge of honor (see: Game, The). But Quik has no interest in battering us with his personal pain; he just wants to tell us about it. So he slips it in easily among the boasts, the jokes, and the party jams. In that way, David mimics the texture of real life-- jokes and confessions, partying and pain, all mixed up together.\nThe Book of David emanates this decidedly zen confidence and ease at every level. Quik has a lifetimes worth of career relationships and unlimited lines of credibility to draw on, but he shows zero interest in crowding his tracks with guest-verse favors called in from his more famous friends to wiggle closer to the mainstream. The features on David-- relative no-names like Jon B., BlaKKazz K. K., local legends like Suga Free, over-the-hill West Coast rappers like Ice Cube and Kurupt-- are his compatriots, people hes worked with for years, and they slot into his overall work exactly as he sees fit. When youve exerted the kind of unacknowledged influence on your art form that Quik has, bitterness can take hold easily. But Quik has chosen a wiser route: Hes created a tiny island on which he is king.",

        "article_text": "Gang Gang Dance started as free-form noiseniks; over the years, theyve managed to mellow out without moving to the center-- evolving into purveyors of pan-cultural body-music, marrying club beats with lyrics about communing with the dead. Like Arthur Russell before them, they give equal floorspace to the spiritual and the sensual. By those loopy standards, Eye Contact-- the groups latest album-- is Gang Gang Dances finest, weirdest, and most uplifting statement yet.\nEye Contact doesnt kick off so much as it wakes up, easing into existence via 11-minute opener, \"Glass Jar\". Synth and piano arpeggios shine through the stereo field, percolating through a filter of jazz percussion before settling into a propulsive Eastern groove. Its a song about reincarnation. Its \"Darkstar\" and Alice Coltrane and the Boredoms in one blissed-out burst of sound. Theyre not much of a singles band, though. Gang Gang Dances vision tends to require a larger, album-length, canvas. Since 2005s Gods Money, each of the bands records has played as a single piece-- each song slurring into the next, building toward an ecstatic climax, mirroring the feel of a concert performance or a DJ set. Eye Contact holds to that ideal. Seven songs are strung together into a single composition, bound by abstract ligatures.\nBut its an improvement of the formula. On Eye Contact, Gang Gang strike a better balance of song craft and atmosphere. The bands previous record, Saint Dymphna, had admirable futurist-pop ambitions-- collaging elements of hyphy, grime, techno, and contemporary R\u0026B into a psychedelic stew-- but it sometimes came off overcooked. The instrumentals were often bursting with soupy sonic details, while Gang Gangs passes at honest-to-goodness pop-- other than Kate Bush-homage \"House Jam\"-- were at times stiff and over-considered.\nEye Contact is considerably more relaxed. Its a smooth and moody record. The composed parts are more memorable. The interludes are, well, shorter. Following Dymphna, the bands original drummer, Tim Dewit, parted ways with the group. His distinctive, stuttering rhythms are missed, but his replacement, Jesse Lee-- a steadier and harder hitting player -- brings a more consistent feel to the rhythm section. Ariel Pink bassist Tim Koh adds some quiet storm-style bass to the airy and melodic \"Chinese High\". Hot Chip frontman Alexis Taylor wanders onto the mic during \"Romance Layers\" to croon over some a new jack-era soul.\nAnd yet this is not a pop record, per se, but the stuff of pop records collected, melted down, and then dribbled Jackson Pollock-style onto a canvas. Singer Lizzi Bougatsos borrows melodies from Indian pop, Brian DeGraw swipes some sub bass from the UK underground, and guitarist Josh Diamond nicks some riffs from North Africa. But Gang Gang arent just collecting exotic hooks for the sake of bragging rights. The band seems to consciously gravitate toward cultures and genres where music is still overtly tethered to spirituality. Maybe its because they miss their friends. Eye Contact is a ghost-heavy record. Two songs are dedicated to fallen New York art scene comrades. \"Glass Jar\" pays homage to former band mate Nathan Maddox, who was killed by a lightning bolt in 2002. \"Sacer\" is a shout-out to artist Dash Snow, who perished in 2009, from a drug overdose.\nEye Contact dials back the aural fog, at least by Gang Gang standards. Its a tighter and more focused record that pares back the bands habit for noisy embellishment and psychic jewelry to reveal taught rhythms and catchy hooks. \"In the past, I imagined our music being more about closing your eyes and escaping,\" explained DeGraw during a recent interview. \"This one felt wide-eyed, as if we were just staring at the listener.\" Whether theyre comfortable with the outside world is less clear. \"Better call the neurosurgeon,\" sings Bougatsos on album closer \"Thru and Thru\". \"Our dreaming space it is open.\"",

        "article_text": "Watch the Throne features the following things: absurdly expensive samples, a pair of choruses from Odd Future R\u0026B singer Frank Ocean at the exact moment where hes turning the corner and becoming a Thing, another chorus from long-been-a-Thing Beyoncé, a buddy-buddy shoutout to the President of the United States, multiple namechecks of brands so expensive that youve probably never heard of half of them, a murderers row of producers working on almost every track, and a fleeting moment where Bon Ivers Justin Vernon sounds like the funkiest man alive. And yet for Jay-Z and Kanye West, this could actually be viewed as a relatively minor album. Amazing.\nThe album comes hot on the heels of career-landmark albums from both artists, but the few months they spent recording it on multiple continents were practically vacations compared to the way they usually work. Kanyes opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, still less than a year old, won across-the-board critical raves for its lush, prog-rap expansiveness; to create it, Kanye sequestered himself in Hawaii and flew in an endless stream of creative-peak collaborators. Jay, meanwhile, is still cruising on the momentum of The Blueprint 3, an artistically flat but commercially massive grab for continued relevance that did everything he wanted it to do. Watch the Throne brings little of Twisted Fantasys boundary-melting ambition or The Blueprint 3s commercial acumen. Its just two of raps biggest figures and best friends getting together to make some of the swollen, epic music that comes so naturally to them. Listening to it is sort of like watching George Clooney get all his movie-star friends together for a party at his Italian villa, and, along the way, maybe dream up Oceans Twelve. (I liked Oceans Twelve.)\nIn the past week, Internet sleuths have pointed out that the release of many Jay-Z albums have coincided with some national or international calamity, 9/11 not excluded. Watch the Throne is no exception: its release on the same day as yet another catastrophic stock market downturn has led some critics to conclude that the pairs boasts of obscene wealth is out of step with the times. Thats a fair case to make. But one of the striking things about Watch the Throne is how often Jay and Kanye address matters beyond their bank accounts. On \"Why I Love You\", its Jays dismay at past crewmates betrayals. On \"Murder to Excellence\", its black-on-black crime and the scarcity of people of color at societys highest seats. On \"Made in America\", its the hardships of youth and coming of age. \"New Day\" is framed as a letter to the pairs imagined sons, a device that mostly gives them a chance to soul-search and self-criticize. On \"Welcome to the Jungle\", Jay, never a tortured pop star, actually says, \"Im fuckin depressed.\" Despite all the triumphant bravado these two bring to practically everything they do, they work overtime here to bring a sense of empathy to this enterprise. Once in a while, they even sound vaguely humble.\nThese subtler moments are admirable, but they dont always work. Consider, for example, the song \"Thats My Bitch\", on which Kanye and his collaborators flip the classic \"Apache\" break into a devastating dance-rap monster with synths zooming off in every direction and Justin Vernon making the aforementioned sweaty soul moves. Its a vicious song, catchy as fuck, but it turns out to be weirdly awkward. Despite the title, Jays verse is all devotional-prophet; it mostly concerns the way American beauty standards so often work against women of color. The sentiment deserves respect, but his laidback delivery, on a track with production and structure that call for ferocity, drains his ideas of force.\nWatch the Throne works best when Jay and Kanye are just talking about how great they are. The single \"Otis\" is dizzy fun, with Jay and Kanye rapping hard and swapping mics like hungry kids. \"Niggas in Paris\" rides an impossibly propulsive synth riff and gigantic drums and gives Jay a chance to display the technical rap wizardry he still has in him. (It also features this great Kanye moment, \"Doctors say Im the illest because Im suffering from realness/ Got my niggas in Paris, and they going gorillas,\" followed by a sample of Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory talking about how awesome shit doesnt have to mean anything.) \"Gotta Have It\" unites Kanye and the Neptunes to crazily chop up James Brown vocal samples and Eastern flute melodies. And \"Who Gon Stop Me\" finds Kanye cussing in Pig Latin while turning dubstep-rap into a viable subgenre.\nIf you buy Watch the Throne from iTunes-- the only place you can buy it at the moment-- youll notice that its credited to \"JAY Z \u0026 Kanye West\" (capital letters and missing hyphen unexplained). But while Jay might be billed first for senioritys sake, Kanye is this albums obvious guiding force. Throughout, he displays levels of unequaled audacity. On \"Otis\" and \"Gotta Have It\", he reduces Otis Redding and James Brown to simple grunts, then builds rhythm tracks out of them. On \"New Day\", over a beat co-produced by RZA, he actually runs Nina Simone through Auto-Tune. On \"No Church in the Wild\", he authoritatively vows, \"You will not control the threesome.\" The musical scope of Watch the Throne is a tribute to his distinctive taste and sense of style. The whole thing sounds huge, and even the sillier moments (\"Made in America\", especially, reminds me of the inspirational ballads of late-period Michael Jackson) succeed on pure orchestral excess. Jay and Kanye debuted the album in a private listening session at a New York planetarium, a setting which made perfect sense: even if it never approaches the grandeur or character-study complexity of Twisted Fantasy, this is still exploding-star music.\nSo: two long-reigning titans make a relatively quick album which, despite their best efforts, still winds up being a monument to their own grandiosity. Should we care? Well, yeah. Kanye doesnt have a cruise-control switch, and when hes around, neither does Jay. On Watch the Throne, they push each other and have fun doing it, and the result is a stadium-sized event-rap spectacle that still sounds like two insanely talented guys idiosyncratic vision. Thats worth celebrating.",

        "article_text": "\"On tour, Lord of the Flies. Aw, hey, who cares? Whats a guuuii-taaaaar?\" So begins the sharply titled \"On Tour\", a spacious, diary-like explosion nestled just a few minutes into Smoke Ring for My Halo, Kurt Viles fourth and finest full-length to date. Strings buzz, strummed patterns double back on themselves and from up above it all, the Philadelphia-native showers everything with cosmic, harp-like harmonics. Its a song thats both monastic and vast all at once, the kind of curiously rich work that seems like it was crafted by forty longhairs instead of just one. But Vile has gone great lengths in answering his own question in recent years, finding a way to distill thousands of hours spent with classic American guitar music into one very singular and sublime vision. Whether hes channeling the energies of John Fahey or Tom Petty or even Bob Seger, Smoke Ring makes clear that the end result is his alone.\nBut to listen to Kurt Vile is to hear him in conversation with himself: That can be said of his ultra-wry lyrical observations just as much as the elliptical, brick-by-brick architecture of his songwriting. In the past, though, Viles words have been written off as mumbled, unintelligible, and listless-- a criticism made all the more reasonable given the crude recording techniques he employed. But 2009s Childish Prodigy, his Matador debut, found Vile wiping off some of the grimy, decidedly \"lo-fi\" film that had fenced off much of his work up until that point. (Additionally, he brought his sometime touring band, the Violators, into the studio to help fill out those songs that required more brawn. They also appear here.) It was a jump to the relative big leagues that, despite its cleaner approach, offered more in the way of promise than focus. Thats not at all the case here. As hinted at by last years Square Shells EP, a \"stepping stone\" to where we are now, the sonics and vocals have been spit-polished to shimmer-- every sonorous detail can now be heard in full, and Viles voice has taken on a new, mountainous presence in the center of each song. The conversations grown far more engaging.\nWhat we learn is that Kurt Vile has a lot to say. He can be quick, as on the strong-jawed, electric groove of \"Puppet to the Man\", when he opens, \"I bet by now you probably think Im a puppet to the man. Well Ill tell you right now, you best believe that I am.\" And he can yank your heart out, as he does a number of times here, perhaps most memorably amid the celestial fingerpicking of \"Babys Arms\", when he tries convincing himself that, hell \"never ever, ever be alone.\" But hes actually always alone here. Viles lonesome brand of melancholia is still communicated both plainly and unassumingly enough to be missed, but its that sense that he seems to be talking only to himself that lends these songs such magnetic pull. Between the two seismic chords of \"Ghost Town\" this albums bulldozing climax, Vile wonders aloud, \"think Ill never leave my couch again, because when Im out, Im away in my mind. Christ was born,  I was there. You know me, Im around. I got friends, hey wait, where was I, well, I am trying.\" Although he stretches those last two or three notes, it doesnt feel like hes singing. Were eavesdropping on the most private of dialogs.\nSonically and compositionally, Vile allows us the space to do that. Hes still cycling between strummers and fingerpicked mazework, but the battery of pedal effects is mostly gone. Rather than stitch loop to loop to loop, Viles  given every marvelous, carefully placed layer all kinds of room to aerate. In the past, \"Peeping Tomboy\" may have sunk halfway through its bridge, while single \"In My Time\" probably would have lost its way mid-jam. But here, Vile has acknowledged limits in length for the sake of depth. It makes for a full-blown journey. Though there isnt an earworm like \"Freeway\"-- that endlessly replayable, interstate love song from Viles 2008 Constant Hitmaker LP-- Smoke Rings isnt that kind of listen. This feels like a family of songs, one whose complexion and course changes as a whole with every spin. In the closing moments of \"Ghost Town\", Vile leaves us with, \"Raindrops might fall on my head sometimes, but I dont pay em any mind. Then again, I guess it aint always that way.\" He knows exactly what hes trying to say.",

        "article_text": "Every era has a sound. When considering this, it can be easy to forget that the sound developed as a way to express something. Music heard as kitsch years later was once put forth with complete sincerity. I mention this in connection with Kaputt, the new record from Dan Bejars Destroyer, because the first thing that strikes you about the album is its unusual sound, one for which weve all developed a cluster of associations. The production and arrangements evoke a narrow window of time-- sometime between, say, 1977 and 1984, or between Chuck Mangiones \"Feels So Good\" and Sades Diamond Life with stops along the way for Roxy Musics Avalon and Steely Dans Gaucho. It slides between soft rock, smooth jazz, and new romantic pop. The bass is fretless; the synths have the blocky contrast of a Nagel painting; there are heavily reverbed trumpets and saxophones that almost serve as a Greek chorus, trilling away at the end of every line to enforce the beautiful plasticity of these songs. For Destroyer, this sound is new, and its there for a reason.\nThe sound casts Bejars songs in a very particular light, and reinforces the feeling of the singer as persona. Bejar has always come across this way to varying degrees, sure, and his albums all have their own unique feel-- the rootsy art-pop of Destroyers Rubies, the MIDI experiments of Your Blues, and so on. But here the persona seems even more sharply defined. Singing these songs, Bejar comes over as the wizened ex-playboy; hes indulged every vice, come through the other side, and now looks on amused. The cover of Leonard Cohens Death of a Ladies Man, a record that seems to serve as a spiritual (though not sonic) father to this one, shows this figure in its quintessential form. On that sleeve, we see a man in sharp but slightly disheveled dress, a cigarette dangling from a couple of fingers; beautiful people are seated at the nightclub table, ready for another night of glamor and pleasure.\nLeonard Cohen in that image has a sense of swagger, and you want to pull up a chair, have a drink, and hear him hold forth on the topic of his choice. The figure inside the songs of Kaputt understands the allure of this life while understanding equally its futility. On early listens, a couple of lines from the title track jump out and seem to serve as a thesis for the record as a whole. \"Wasting your days chasing some girls, alright/ Chasing cocaine through the backrooms of the world all night,\" Bejar sings, as horns twist around in a bath of reverb. He sounds bemused, but not necessarily judgmental, holding two feelings in mind at once: our reflex to indulge ourselves, and the knowledge that its killing us.\nBut this happens on just one level, which is what makes Kaputt so fantastic. It goes as deep as you want to go. People can miss that Dan Bejar is funny as hell-- he seeds his music with lyrical and musical in-jokes, and everyone has their own favorite lines to pluck out of his songs and admire for their concise wit. He likes surprises-- few lyric sheets have as many exclamation points. But the essential quality of all his records is complexity. They are doing a lot of things at once. Kaputt feels rich.\nFor one, there is the surface beauty of the sound. Some less inclined to the pleasures of the music from the aforementioned era might have an initial reaction to its essential corniness, but once youve tuned in, it sounds beautiful. The songs seem delicate and glassy and shimmering, and Bejar has toned down his quirky voice and sounds relaxed and focused. So its easy to enjoy bumping the wet, jazzy pop of \"Chinatown\", which suggests the rainy streets of an old city and new dramas unfolding around every corner. Or wallow in the simple and elegant hook of \"Blue Eyes\", the way Bejar voice works next to Vancouver singer Sibel Thrasher, a regular vocal presence on Kaputt who sort of serves as the Nicolette Larson to Bejars Neil Young. But \"Blue Eyes\" also has sly lyrical references (\"your first loves new order,\" \"Mother Natures Son\") and funny put-downs (\"I sent a message in a bottle to the press/ It said, Dont be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves\"). More than any other Destroyer record, you can just throw this on and it sounds good, and plenty will do well stopping there. But for those so inclined, theres more to explore.\nSo the lite-jazz style can seem a little funny, but it can also be sad and sexy and joyous. And the writing is dense with references-- to other songs on the album, songs by other bands, to the music business, art outside the sphere of music. \"Suicide Demo for Kara Walker\" is the most striking example. Its a collaboration with the artist Kara Walker, whose work, among other things, probes the racial history of America. Bejar adapted the words she provided for him on cue cards, and the result is fragmented and dream-like, taking the Destroyer project to a new place. \"Wise, old, black and dead in the snow: My Southern sister...\" isnt the sort of thing weve heard from him before. An early demo of the song reminded Bejar of the band Suicide, hence the title. Thats how things work in his world. Laughs are mixed with grim insights.\nTwo tracks stick out a bit here. The astonishing \"Bay of Pigs\", released as a single in 2009, concludes the CD version of this album, and its the one song that feels out of place. Its longer, proggy, uses different textures, and ultimately seems to be here because its an amazing song and as many people as possible need to hear it. Fair enough. And the vinyl version of Kaputt also has a side-long, 20-minute ambient track with just a bit of voice called \"The Laziest River\", which is enjoyable and immersive but not essential. Both indulgences are easily forgivable.\nBands can be brands or concepts that can be summed up in a line or two-- which is the power of brands. Its a good thing in proper doses. But Bejars essential complexity ultimately feels human. It seems absurd to look for genuine wisdom in music in 2011, when were constantly gorging ourselves on the all-you-can-eat buffet of post-modern web culture. But Kaputt feels wise. Like a mirror that actually points back at something better. Something you can jam and let wash over you, but also something you can use. It feels funny, tragic, artful, and ultimately true.",

        "article_text": "Theres a moment in \"The Wolves (Act I and II)\", a song on Justin Vernons debut album as Bon Iver, For Emma, Forever Ago, where you first suspect that theres more going on with this dude than meets the eye. Up until that point, the record is, as advertised, ascetic and stripped down, the product of a person alone in a cabin for months with only a guitar for company. The songs early on bring to mind snow, wood, creaky furniture, drawn breaths-- organic materials that could have been just as easily assembled 80 years ago. But as Vernon sings the \"what might have been lost\" refrain in \"Wolves\", you hear something strange creeping in: One of the many voices, which are layered and harmonized, both full and falsetto, is run through some kind of vocoder-like effect. Its subtle at first, added without drawing much attention to itself, but it even so it feels like the floor dropping out. Just like that, the song is broken wide open, and Vernons music is infused with a sense of unexpected possibility.\nThat boundless feeling was confirmed on Bon Ivers Blood Bank EP, released at the beginning of this year. One if its songs, \"Woods\", was an a cappella number with every voice processed, as Vernon stretched and trilled the phrases like Crosby, Stills, Nash, and T-Pain. Yes, these effects became absurdly ubiquitous last year, and the mere fact that it was used was nothing special. But Vernon is operating in a milieu-- an emotionally driven singer-songwriter on a noted indie rock label-- where people dont usually do such things. Especially so early in a promising career, where youre not sure how your audience might react. My sense is that Vernon was able to put expectations aside; he had a sound in mind and he went for it, without worrying too much about what a \"Bon Iver\" song should be. And that in itself was exciting.\nSo after Emmas deserved success, the nifty stopgap EP, and Vernons long stretch on the road winning new fans, his next move proves to be yet another welcome curveball: teaming with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees for a short album of experimental pop as Volcano Choir. Vernons voice is one of the most distinctive going right now, so you can always hear him in this music. But at the same time, Unmap in no way feels like any sort of follow-up to Emma. This is partly because these tracks arent really songs. Words mean very little, and theres not much in the way of verses or choruses. Instead, Vernons voice becomes a texture, a tool for shading the tracks and bringing them into focus. Collections of Colonies of Bees, who have over the last couple of records proven to be the rare instrumental rock band with ideas about how to keep things both surprising and musical, bring Vernon into their world, which turns out to be a very good thing.\nWhen it all comes together, the results are dazzling. \"Seeplymouth\" is one highlight. With its repeating guitar chimes and chanted voices, it begins with a loose, jazzy feel weirdly reminiscent of Peanuts composer Vince Guaraldi. But then, after a sung passage by Vernon, it continues to build in intensity until its a huge, pumping mass of crashing drums and wailed voices, something apocalyptic and almost unbearably intense. Equally impressive, and much closer to a conventional song, is the following \"Island, IS\", with its hyper-repetitive keyboard pulse drawn from modern classical, loping drums, and Vernon singing mesmerizingly opaque phrases that sound like the product of automatic writing.\nHeard back-to-back, these two tracks suggest a sort of fusion between the U.S. and UK versions of post-rock. Theres definitely some Talk Talk here, in the way assumptions about sound and structure are re-thought from the ground up and used in service of a new kind of song. But theres also a sense of Tortoises studiousness, the way existing genres are toyed with and then broken down for parts. But despite the looseness and the grab-bag approach, the best of the songs on Unmap-- the airy opener \"Husks and Shells\", with its plucked acoustic and Vernon multi-tracked into reverb-heavy choir, and \"Still\", which is a longer, better version of the EPs \"Woods\" augmented by droning keyboards and Steve Reich-like figures-- feel right as rain, like these weird mash-ups were there all along, just waiting to be discovered.\nSome of the tracks are unformed explorations that werent pursued as far as they could have been, but even these have something to recommend. \"Dote\" puts Vernon in an echoing cavern and stretches his voice out to a rich, gothic drone that sounds like something Kranky would have loved to put out in the late 1990s. But it lasts only for three minutes and feels like its just getting rolling when it crashes sharply into \"And Gather\". But then, fortunately, the latter is another short, intriguing track, bringing to mind Animal Collectives Sung Tongs with its acoustic guitar figure, handclaps, and chants. So where half-formed ideas are found, sharp editing keeps the album moving along. The only track that doesnt work is \"Mbira in the Morass\", which finds Vernon straining for a kind of bent soul vibe over a shapeless background heavy on the titular instrument. Still, one skip on such a truly experimental record-- theyre really trying stuff here, not totally sure if its going to work-- is an impressive feat. And for Vernon, the possibilities now seem even more vast.",

        "article_text": "The title of the Fields third album, Looping State of Mind, might have you thinking that producer Axel Willner is getting back to basics. Especially after he strayed, with only intermittent success, from his instantly recognizable template on his 2009 sophomore record, Yesterday and Today. After all, at its simplest, techno is music that can be built with just a few loops. And Willners first few records certainly made effective use of the form, layering shimmering loops of voice and synth and guitar on each track until hed built a fluffy and infinitely soothing wall of sound.\nImmersive and repetitive, the Fields first singles and 2007 debut album, From Here We Go Sublime, were like ambient records disguised as both experimental techno and luscious pop. So is Looping State of Mind a return to that sound, the one that made the Field a crossover favorite with rock kids a few years back? Not exactly. In a few instances its barely recognizable as \"the Field\" at all. It may be still be built from loops, but Willners never orchestrated so many of them so artfully into such dense and infinitely listenable soundscapes.\nGood thing, too, because the last few years have seen a lot of bedroom producers become briefly famous for ambient records disguised as pop, for amorphous electronic doodles disguised as songs. Instead of coasting, as one of the inadvertent models for the current \"chill\" thing, a producer whod probably earn infinite props just for repeating himself, Willner decided to put 99 percent of his acolytes to shame here. True, there are still tracks, like \"Its Up There\", that recall Willners best-loved stuff, but even they feel richer, like the early Field in 3D and high-def. \"Arpeggiated Love\" is on the one hand a dead-ringer for the propulsive, ecstatic sound-wash of From Here We Go Sublime. But Willner now fleshes it out with shiver-inducing soul music harmonies that owe less to sleek German techno than gospel-tinged American house. True, he was quoting classic soul group the Flamingos as early as Sublime, but hes never been so overt in dipping into dance musics global history.\nAs that might suggest, Looping often strays far from the Field we know, into territory that recalls deep house, post-punk, shoegaze, noise-rock, and cosmic techno. And he manages to swirl them all together in a way that makes his earliest attempts to fuse ambient and trance feel like gorgeous apprentice work. Yesterday and Today sometimes sounded hesitant, as if Willner didnt quite know how to make his music fresh for a second time. On Looping he packs all seven tracks with curveballs, and each new direction feel successful, vital, surprising.\nAt one point on opener \"Is This Power\", everything drops away except for an eerie bass twang that recalls Joy Division or the Cure circa \"A Forest\", but when the boogie bass finally drops back in, youre not only reminded that this is dance music, its easily the funkiest Field tune youve probably yet heard. The rhythms on Looping are more varied than anything the Willners done before. Though he hasnt entirely abandoned that programmed motorik pulse that drove Sublime, his work with live bands over the last few years has clearly fed into Looping. \"Then Its White\" summons a Yorke-less Radiohead, with the way the drums subtly mesh human fluency and digital tech. And thats not even counting the Amnesiac-like mix of pensive piano and mournful, computer-warped vocals.\nDespite the sometimes winning simplicity of his music, Willner was no slouch as a producer before. Yet listening to this album, theres no doubt hes grown way more assured and inventive over the last two years. And hes brought all his skill to bear on Looping, as composer and arranger and texturologist, in order to build something this simultaneously sweeping and subtle, deep and immediate. It could still alienate those perpetually pining for copies of \"A Paw in My Face\" or \"Sun and Ice\". But if they listen more deeply, they might just hear Willner’s masterpiece-to-date.",

        "article_text": "We may eventually remember 2011 as the Year of Retro. Critic Simon Reynolds recent book on the subject tapped into a feeling a lot of people had but couldnt quite pin down: In the age of the limitless archive, the relationship between new artists and their influences are changing. Since the retirement of LCD Soundsystem, San Franciscos Girls, who return here after the terrific debut LP Album and an also-great follow-up EP, just might be the band best making use of the current situation. Their music pilfers from the past without shame but also manages to sound like no one else.\nThe first listen to Father, Son, Holy Ghost brings with it an almost eerie sense of familiarity, like these are songs youve been hearing your whole life even when you cant place them, and its sometimes startling just how specific the references can be. The opening \"Honey Bunny\" has a shuffling beat and riff that is close to Paul Simons \"Kodachrome\"; \"Love Like a River\" has a verse structure, chord changes, and tinkling piano arrangement almost identical to the Beatles \"Oh! Darlin\", which was itself a direct rip of songs like \"Blueberry Hill\". \"Magic\" has bouncy sunshine pop chords that bring to mind something from a Have a Nice Day comp, \"Die\" has almost the same melody as Deep Purples \"Highway Star\". The arrangements throughout have whirring organ, guitar fills, solos, flutes, and backing vocals borrowed from classic rock and placed exactly where you would expect them to be. And tying it all together is the production from Doug Boehm and the band, which sounds \"old\" simply because it sounds so incredibly good. This is one of the best-sounding rock records in years, redolent of a time when there was more money to spend in getting the basic tracks perfect, better ears to figure out which microphone should be used and precisely where it should be placed, and no pressure to make the mix ultra-hot for digitally-driven radio.\nBut if Father were merely an exceptionally recorded album built on obvious nods to the past, it wouldnt add up to much. Instead, the record comes alive with color and personality largely thanks to Girls singer and songwriter Christopher Owens. He has a preternatural gift for turning clichés into into deeply affecting songs, and as they jump from one style to the next, from delicate acoustic balladry to noisy rave-ups, Owens voice and point of view ground the record and make it distinctive. He is the center. As long as he is writing and singing, no matter what else is going on and being referenced, the music will be utterly his.\nA lot of that is up to the timbre of his voice. On Album, Owens often had the pinched, clogged-sinus tone of Elvis Costello without the sneer, but here his vocals are warmer and softer, often bringing to mind the whispery tone of Elliott Smith. Its a testament to the care of the recording that even when he seems to be cooing into the microphone while the sometimes-thick arrangements grow around him, every word is clear and in balance. His voice exhibits both weariness and innocence and manages to convey hope and despair in equal measure. It also has an androgynous quality that fits the themes of Girls music.\nOwens songs often seem to have an undefined and undirected desire for love and sex and friendship that exists outside of any one idea of sexuality. Its about feelings first, and the object of them second; who or what the singer wants is less important than the fact that the yearning is there, and its unfulfilled, and that hurts. The lack of specificity can give Owens songs a narcissistic slant, but it feels most like the self-obsession of early childhood, where lines between the self and the outside world arent clear. \"I can see so much clearer when I just close my eyes,\" he sings at one point, and it feels like the work of someone who has done a lot of thinking in the dark.\nIndeed, so much about Owens lyrical outlook, from how he uses shopworn imagery to the disarming simplicity of his declarations, conveys the sense of a child feeling around, discovering for the first time things we all found and absorbed years ago. So when he sings \"My love is like a river/ She just keeps on rolling on\" and \"Lay my burden down by the rivers edge\" in \"Love Like a River\", it sounds like someone starting from the simplest conventions of the pop song and working inward to see if life actually functions the way that the songs tell us it does. Not since Jonathan Richman has there been a songwriter so willing to convey honest and deep feelings through the most basic pop syntax, and Owens also shares Richmans desire to use familiar song forms to get these essential messages across.\nOn Album, it was easy to hear the words and focus on Owens backstory, which included being raised in a cult whose belief system contributed to the premature death of his brother. But these songs feel too essential and relatable to connect it to Owens life alone. Its more about what we make of it as listeners and less about the damage of his early years. Theres also a layer of awareness in his delivery, and hes able to tweak his own naïvteté in interesting ways. On the opening song, \"Honey Bunny\", he sings about how his mother loved and accepted him and told him that \"everything will be all right\" and then follows by saying, \"I need a woman who loves me! me! me! me!\"\nThis lyrical simplicity shouldnt obscure the fact that these are sharply constructed songs that take unusual turns. One of Girls specialities is their willingness to go completely over the top but somehow keep us right there with them. Early single \"Vomit\" is one such epic, folding in soulful organ and the kind of wailing gospel-like vocals that signified \"authenticity\" when the Stones and Floyd ruled the world; but, with Owens wounded voice in the middle of it all, even this bombastic song feels personal and even intimate. \"Just a Song\" begins with a gorgeously basic nylon string guitar figure and slowly drifts into a whispered refrain that stretches endlessly, Owens intoning, \"Love, its just a song,\" in his softest way as flutes swirl around him. He seems to be slipping into a widening hole thats half oceanic bliss and half fade-out death, and that combination nods to Spiritualized, an influence that was there on Album and is sometimes present here, particularly in the way Girls dont shy away from repetition and mix sonic decadence with wide-eyed spiritual yearning.\nThe largest canvas of all stretches across \"Forgiveness\", the eight-minute song that serves as the albums emotionally exhausting peak. It builds slowly and winds around in circles as Owens offers homilies about love and fear and redemption, and then it explodes into a melodic and moving guitar solo that releases the considerable tension. Its a big moment on an album that has so many theyre almost hard to pick out, and it also happens to contain some of Owens most straightforward writing: \"Youll have to forgive me brother/ Youll have to forgive me sister/ And Ill have to forgive you if were ever going to move on/ No ones going to find any answers/ If youre looking in the dark/ And looking for a reason to give up.\" Hes right, but while theres nothing remotely new here, somehow the way Owens sings these words makes it feel like were hearing them for the first time too.",

        "article_text": "Nearly three months have passed since Atlanta psych-rock quintet Deerhunter released their mammoth second full-length,  Cryptograms. Now, Kranky is putting out the Fluorescent Grey EP, a set of four intensely focused songs recorded while the album was being mixed. Though clearer and less abrasive than Cryptograms musically, the new EP foregrounds lead singer Bradford Coxs morbidly erotic lyrics about the bodys inevitable decomposition-- to him, a psychosexual puzzle-- much as the full-length smothered its gorgeous melodies in effects-laden squall and instrumental ambience. Whether Fluorescent Grey is meant to serve as an epilogue (as its press release maintains) or prologue, the disc is a triumphant document of a stubbornly visionary young band with the world still spread out before them.\n\"I woke up,\" Fluorescent Grey begins, echoing the first words of Cryptograms transformative \"Spring Hall Convert\". This time, though, the setting is the dark of night; the phrase \"fluorescent grey\" describes the color of a boys dead flesh. Piano gets the EPs eponymous opening track off to a peaceful start, joined soon by crisply enunciated vocals and chiming guitar that patiently explodes into the bands familiar needle-burying territory.\nOnce again Deerhunters thematic interests align with those of author Dennis Cooper-- who named his most famous character after a dear ninth-grade friend (and later lover)-- as well as director Pedro Almodovars Bad Education, which Cox cited as his favorite movie in a recent Pitchfork feature. \"Why do I dream so often of his body/ When his body will decay?\" Cox wonders in a wiry tenor, adding, \"You were my god in high school.\" Just when Deerhunter seem most ready to take us into their confidence, otherworldly Sonic Youth whorls drown the singers words, his trusty delay pedal lifting the song to an open-ended conclusion.\nFluorescent Greys taut compositions simmer with the doomed purity of Deerhunters romantic vision. \"In the world there are so many useless bodies,\" Cox sings on midtempo \"Dr. Glass\", listing as examples \"all the couples kissing, the children missing, the corpses rotting.\" His voice here is measured, accompanied by restrained organ-like loops, plus the usual guitar, bass, and drums. The closest thing on the EP to the chaos of Cryptograms first third is high-school kiss reminiscence \"Wash Off\", which relies on droning motorik bass and treated vocal textures similar to those on the full-lengths title track. \"I was 16,\" Cox repeats, his reserve finally shattering in an inspired racket.\nAt the most basic level, what makes Deerhunter so profoundly affecting is the bands joy at rocking the fuck out-- free of both irony and any self-conscious lack thereof-- within their songs impressive intellectual and emotional framework. \"Like New\" distills this energy into little more than two minutes, its dissolute guitars revolving around a deceptively soothing refrain. \"Back to the crypt again,\" Cox intones. The CD version of Fluorescent Grey (as opposed to the vinyl side included in the Cryptograms double-LP release) also includes the hypnotic video for \"Strange Lights\", bringing Deerhunters current phase neatly full circle: Ashes to ashes, and then wake up all over again.",

        "article_text": "The first time you hear the Twilight Sad, a four-piece band from just outside Glasgow, they already sound familiar. Its like theyve been around a while, even though their debut EP only came out last September. You might think of Arab Straps Aiden Moffett when hearing singer James Graham because hes got a feel for concrete imagery and does nothing to hide his thick Scottish accent. Shoegaze comes to mind because guitarist Andy MacFarlane favors billowy curtains of white noise that dominate the sound field. And, as Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan has already pointed out, the Twilight Sad sometimes bring to mind U2, with their shared fondness for huge choruses that occasionally verge on histrionic.\nAll that said, the Twilight Sad are pushing these familiar elements in some unexpected and exciting directions. Graham may sound a bit like Moffett but he doesnt sing about getting wrecked in the pub while trying to forget. His focus is primarily the concerns of adolescence, and he even narrows it down to a specific age. In the first line of the key track \"That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy\", Graham sings \"...14, and you know...\" and you want to stop him right there. (Fourteen. Yes, we know how awful it can be.) But what follows is a portrait of a miserable kid thats both touching and cathartic. Graham sounds angry, with sarcastic barbs about a \"loving mother\" and a \"lovely home,\" but \"That Summer...\" is anything but a tantrum. Hes got about four different levels to his voice in the song, from a calm articulation to a throat-shredding wail, but hes never so clouded by rage that he forgets the details.\nAnd the details are what make the track, and the album, so compelling. The song titles suggest a writer trying to find the profound in the mundane, and in that way they remind me a bit of the Clientele, even though the tone couldnt be more different. Theres lots of weather, elements like earth and fire. There are train rides and long walks to nowhere that offer plenty of time to think. \"Last Years Rain Didnt Fall Quite So Hard\" reads one, and the structure, a canon of Grahams multi-tracked voice swirling around a single piano chord that sounds like the opening of the Velvet Undergrounds \"Im Waiting for My Man\", reflects the sadness streaked with hope. In \"Walking for Two Hours\", Graham sings about being \"so far from home\" as bass drum, crash cymbal, and guitar strums merge into a tightly coiled implosion that drives the loneliness home.\nThe shifts in volume, though not exactly surprising, are crucial. Peter Katis and the band produced, and the sonic arc they construct tracks the lyrics beautifully. Theres a \"big moment\" on most songs where the music gets ridiculously loud and the guitar distortion crowds almost everything out. There is, of course, no trick in this sort of surge; a couple clicks on a floor pedal is all it takes. But the Twilight Sad know how to use dynamic range to advance the plot.\nWith songs so direct and the bands hearts on their sleeves, the musics debt to shoegaze only goes so far. Instead of tying the overdriven fuzz to a blissed-out sense of surrender to noise, the Twilight Sad uses the guitar as another kind of yell. The instrumental title track closing the record touches on My Bloody Valentines \"glide\" guitar drone, but the almost martial drumming, with the snare seemingly vibrated by the guitar amp, keeps the track intimate and grounded. And when the band gets ethereal, its in a loose, folky way, as with the braid of ringing guitar sounding during the coda of \"Talking With Fireworks/ Here, It Never Snowed.\" Regular use of accordion, also played by MacFarlane, imparts an appropriately street-level earthiness to the sound.\nAs exhilarating as Fourteen Autumns is at its most anthemic, the vividness of the lyrical themes ultimately carries the record over. If one were to consider only the widescreen sound while scanning the titles, you might think the Twilight Sad were overwrought and sappy, another example of a band overly concerned with childhood, too young to know how good they really had it. But thats not the way these songs come across at all. The Twilight Sad approach the darker side of growing up with consideration and dignity, and manage to maintain a proper perspective. \"As my bones grew, they did hurt/ They hurt really bad,\" an angst-filled songwriter from another generation once sang; the Twilight Sad do a tremendous job of remembering that ache.",

        "article_text": "James Murphy started releasing dance music some time between \"B.O.B.\" and \"Get Ur Freak On\". It was a golden age for modern pop, a period during which a lot of personal aesthetics crumbled. Indie wasnt a dirty word, but it was a meaningless one. Pop, though, wasnt just more meaningless, it was more everything. And for the first time in a long while, pop also had its evangelicals; people who could argue convincingly in its favor, and who knew how to contextualize it interestingly. That turnover period was an exciting time; the ideological tension, the feeling that something was at stake, the exuberance of redrawing your bounds. The habitual mixtape maker in your life probably remembers it well.\nDespite eventually remixing Britney Spears and N.E.R.D., Murphy never had a hands-on relationship with pop. Nonetheless, his transition out of punk and into dance music ran concurrent with this modest revolution, and its pretty much impossible to separate his epiphanies from ours. That early LCD tracks like \"Losing My Edge\" used to feature in playlists alongside, say, \"Work It\" or \"...Baby One More Time\" only reinforces the link. So its fitting that the finest work of Murphys career is an album that sits squarely at the intersection of all those careening ideologies. Sound of Silver, his second as LCD Soundsystem, is as close to a perfect hybrid of dance and rock musics values as youre likely to ever hear.\nThese days, there isnt as much to talk about. It feels like less is up for grabs, as if music fans are gripped by a general fatigue. Im not sure if you rapidly skim the same articles as I do, but apparently 72% of the internet is now made up of free mp3s, while another 14% is accompanying blurbs. Sometimes, I dont know how you guys do it. Were besieged and stupefied enough by downloads and mixes and remixes and mashups and collections of songs masquerading as albums that an album that feels like an album strikes me as positively ideal right now. Thankfully, Murphy-- a self-confessed 1970s rock nerd who grew up in the heyday of art-rock and albums as Statements-- unapologetically sets out to make dance records that breathe like proper albums.\nIn that respect, Sound of Silver isnt far removed from LCD Soundsystems eponymous 2005 debut, which ultimately tried to do the same thing but fell slightly short. While Sound of Silver makes no bones about Murphys well-known appreciation of Brian Enos pop vocal affectations (\"Get Innocuous\", \"Sound of Silver\"), the Velvet Underground (\"New York I Love You\"), or new-wave (\"Watch the Tapes\"), it never feels like a paste job, but rather just the well-considered work of someone connecting the dots between the past and the present.\nTheres not a single weak track here, and many more already feel classic. \"Sound of Silver\" is a seven-minute suite that morphs from a rumbling, ice-cold, no-wave groove into a liquefied jumble of kalimbas, pianos, and fizzy synths. \"All My Friends\" begins with a piano riff that sounds not unlike a speeding train (or, at least, Steve Reichs approximation of one) and rolls downhill into fireworks. And then theres the song that precedes it, and with which it combines to form the records center. A sleek, delicate, and effortlessly melodic sliver of electro, \"Someone Great\" is my favorite song of the year so far, and constitutes new ground for Murphy both in terms of prettiness and poignancy. Its about loss, but the lyric remains tantalizingly ambiguous. As with most great songs, its best lines buzz around the edges of the story: \"The worst is all the lovely weather/ Im stunned its not raining/ The coffee isnt even bitter/ Because, whats the difference.\"\nMurphy used to court spontaneity by refusing to pre-write any of his lyrics before going into the vocal booth, claiming in interviews that they were all ad-libbed. Its a strategy hes evidently abandoned on Sound of Silver, and the record is much better for it. On \"All My Friends\", for instance, he tackles a favorite subject (getting older) from the wrong end of an all-nighter: \"You spend the first five years trying to get with the plan/ And the next five years trying to be with your friends again.\" On \"North American Scum\", he tackles continental divide with straight deadpan: \"Well I dont know, I dont know where to begin/ we are North American/ And for those of you who still think were from England / were like... No.\"\nWhen its all said and done, Murphys real legacy to dance music will be his production sense. Hes an analog obsessive with a general aversion to software, and Sound of Silver reflects that. Far removed from the compressed, trebly, and overmastered paradigm thats gripped electronic music in the last decade, Sound of Silver sounds deep, spacious, and full-blooded. (Like, um, an old rock record.) Its an absolute joy to listen to, for every possible reason, not the least of which is because, these days, those epiphanies feel like theyre coming fewer and farther between.",

        "article_text": "After centuries of music consumption, were still obsessed with the crescendo. From all that classical music we learned in school to modern soundtrack fodder to the banal quiet/loud/quiet dynamics of groups like Explosions in the Sky, people still seek the thrill that comes when music reaches its stirring Big Moment. Blame remote controls or the death of vinyl, but 30-odd years after Brian Eno invented ambient music, most people are wary about \"turning off\" to any music that doesnt actively seek to engage them. Deep listening remains mostly theoretical in the age of mp3s.\nMinimal techno isnt exactly built for the iPod age, so whats a post-disco producer to do when he wants the restraint but also the explosion? If most 21st century pop music could be whittled down to a ringtone without losing any of its effect, a dance producer who actually manages to hook the ear for six or seven minutes after that opening jolt-- while still rejecting, you know, narrative or harmonic development-- is doing something special.\nAxel Willner, founder and sole member of the Field, is hardly the first to split the difference, but his formally simple yet functionally overwhelming music captures not only those big ecstatic peaks but also the initial ringtone-esque bursts like the two sides of the same coin they are, and basically just repeats them until he decides to stop tape. Willners records under his Field alias (his other guises include Cordouan, Lars Blek, and Porte) do away with the build-up almost entirely while still milking the climax like a chemist running real-time tests to see just how long hes got until the drugs effect wears off.\nThat kind of pared-down sound-sculpting is everywhere in continental European electronic music these days, but rarely is it as instantly enveloping or as comforting as the Fields debut, From Here We Go Sublime. The album recalls Kaito, another artist on the German label with one great idea, likewise pushing wistfulness and simplicity to the brink. Favoring a dreamy minimalism of just a few sounds waltzing around each other, Willner smears, chops, and processes slivers of musical information-- the tips of a vocal, a note and a half of an instrumental-- in a delicate computer-assisted retrieval process. But unlike other maestros of hiccup and twang, Willner favors uncomplicated, revolving compositions rather than a loom-like mesh. Its a bare bones compositional gambit that could wind up utterly irritating, but with the ears of a hip-hop cratedigger and the hands of a surgeon is bliss. Gliding like zero-gravity skaters, opener \"Over the Ice\" spins, twirls, and pivots on just a shivering vocalized \"e\"-- split across two octaves-- and an undulating \"i.\"\nBut if Sublime initially sounds set for the dancefloor and not the couch, its strictly down to Willner favoring quick tempos and rhythms, like the concussive \"uh!\" and the bumping acid bassline on \"The Little Heart Beats So Fast\". Despite its nods to house and techno, Sublime is really an extension of the best ambient electronics of the last decade or so, especially Gas, a project of Wolfgang Voigt, who as co-owner of Kompakt Records is now releasing the Fields music. (Not for nothing did Willners sublime \"Kappsta\" appear on Kompakts Pop Ambient 2007 even as it could easily fit here.) Folks may also call the Field trance, because theres an often anthemic bigness to Willners little sounds, a certain shameless bombastic quality to the way he deploys his loops and builds his arpeggios. And like both bog-standard dancefloor trance and ethereal Gas records such as Pop, Field tracks sound loud, even when played soft.\nPeople may also call it trance because of Willners elementary drum tracks, often just a deflated machine thump flecked with hi-hat hiss. Compared to peers like Perlon, Kompakt may not be particularly known for its adventurous drum programming but Willners purposefully entry-level beats shift much of the percussive burden onto his melodies. And while Willner may be building his arpeggios out of baby love sighs snatched from the mouths of the Temptations (on \"Things Keep Falling Down\", sadly not included here) or strummed guitar loops nicked from nuggets of yacht rock instead of preset synth pads or Ableton plug-ins, his spirit animals are the likes of Sasha, Digweed, and Tiesto, guiding him on how to put his sounds together for maximum spine-tingly impact. Theres a reason those guys sold so many records to a whole generation of folks looking for, well, the sublime. And like all those 2xCD 1990s trance mixes, an hour of Willners vibrations may have you drooling for an off-beat or a key change or, hell, a build-up to crescendo.\nBut forget pop musical concerns for a second-- Willners triumph on Sublime remains how he manages to isolate and repeat his little moments, transmuting them through the basic dance music building blocks of juxtaposition and repetition into something bigger, wringing pleasure out of the always potentially dull aforementioned \"sound sculpting\": The metallic schlurp of the drums and background hum of robot cicadas on \"Mobilia\"; the fingertip flutters of the textural stuttering all over Sublime; the hot and heavy pressurized soaking of \"Sun and Ice\"; the disembodied zombie doowop filched from the Flamingos \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" that echoes through the title track like Kraftwerk daydreaming theyre a soul duo, before the voices finally unspool into a timestretched blur as the record fades out-- one of the most shiver-inducing moments youll hear all year. Often the best part of Willners tracks are those final few seconds, as on \"A Paw in My Face\", the guitar sample finally escapes its loop with a joyous twang of freedom (only to reveal its source as Lionel Richies bloodless lite-FM staple \"Hello\"). If Willner doesnt hit at least some of your pleasure centers, well, forget your ears-- your nerve endings might actually be dead. Even three months in, its a safe bet that From Here We Go Sublime will wind up 2007s most luxuriant record.",

        "article_text": "You have to lower the stakes after an album like Ys, because you cant raise them. Joanna Newsoms follow-up is a lot less formally ambitious: A three-song quickie, with one new song and two old ones, recorded live in the studio with four members of her acoustic touring band. Of course, \"less formally ambitious\" on Newsoms scale is off the charts on virtually anyone elses. \"I was coding a lot of my experience in terms of excess of water,\" she told Pitchfork last November about the lyrical process that produced Ys, and Ys Street Band-- especially its tremendous new song, \"Colleen\"-- seems to be conceptual overspill from the album.\n\"Colleen\" is inarguably an excess-of-water song: If Im reading the handwritten lyric sheet right, its a sort of Drawing Restraint 9-in-reverse scenario about a woman whos forgotten she used to be a whale, being confronted with the knowledge of her past. (Vivid detail: Shes now wearing a corset, which of course would be made of whalebone. A whale in her dream says \"Whats cinched round your waist, Colleen?/ Is that my very own baleen?/ No! Have you forgotten everything?\") It may be a way of addressing the kind of Chinese Democracy-style creative block that comes from immersion in making an Important Work: \"I tilled and planted, but could not produce/ Not root, nor leaf, nor flower, nor bean; Lord!/ It seemed I overwatered everything.\"\nToo much water again-- and Newsom even line-breaks like a print poet. Its true: She does lead with her lyrics. But shes also an extraordinary and unmistakable tune-maker. Her melodies are Proustian, winding things, so the details of their arrangements and performances signify a lot. Recast without the immense orchestrations of its Ys incarnation, \"Cosmia\" becomes more intimate, less a framed-and-mounted artifact. And touring seems to have sanded some of the snags off of Newsoms voice; shes singing better here than she has on record before.\nThe danger of using acoustic instruments is that people may mistake you for a \"folk\" musician, which Newsom really isnt-- although \"Colleen\", more than anything else shes written, owes a lot of its lyrical and musical cadences to traditional music of the British Isles. (Remember, \"colleen\" isnt just a name: Its Irish usage can just mean \"girl\" or \"young woman.\") The cadences of her songs and singing have a lineage of which shes well aware; this time, there are faint echoes of Kate Bush and (especially when drummer Neal Morgan harmonizes with her on an excellent remake of The Milk-Eyed Menders \"Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie\") Desire-era Bob Dylan, both of whom are similarly well-connected to their own aesthetic roots. But theres nobody else playing Newsoms game right now, and as good as it is that she can produce a varnished marvel like Ys, its even more heartening to see her moving beyond it this quickly.",

        "article_text": "In recent years, dance musics growing mainstream prominence has led to a number of excellent debuts: SBTRKT and Holy Ghost!s self-titled efforts, Classixxs Hanging Gardens, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs Trouble, and Katy Bs On a Mission, to name a few. These records gained notice for recontextualizing the sounds of dances various sub-genres-- disco, dubstep, house, and more-- into pop-leaning structures. The latest addition to this list is Settle, the brilliant debut album by Disclosure. The Surrey duo have not only made 2013s best dance record so far-- theyve also concocted one of the most assured, confident debuts from any genre in recent memory. That theyve done so on a major-label record thats absolutely loaded with guest spots-- these are typically red flags when approaching any dance full-length with crossover potential-- is nothing short of a miracle.\nThe brothers behind Disclosure, Howard and Guy Lawrence, seem impossibly young considering their talents: Guy is 21, while younger brother Howard just turned 18 a few weeks ago. But theyve actually been on the scene for three years, and their artistic growth over that period is impressive. Back in 2010, Disclosure first emerged on the blog circuits nether regions with \"Street Light Chronicle\", a slice of competent, indistinct bass music that sounded like what youd expect from a pair that have cited Burials Untrue and Joy Orbisons \"Hyph Mngo\" as their gateways into club fare. With every succeeding release, however, Disclosure rapidly moved away from \"Street Light Chronicle\"s weatherbeaten greys towards a smoother, brighter sound. Last years fantastic remix of Jessie Wares \"Running\" greatly increased both artists profiles; earlier this year, Disclosures collaboration with AlunaGeorge singer Aluna Francis, \"White Noise\", rocketed to #2 on the UK Singles chart two weeks after its release. Clearly, theyve come a long way in a short time.\nA number of tracks from Disclosures earlier releases would be considered highlights on any debut album. Two of them, \"Boiling\" and \"Whats in Your Head\", from the enjoyable 2011 EP The Face, are relegated to bonus track status on Settles deluxe edition. That such strong material didnt make the album proper speaks to its high quality. Over its hour-long runtime, Settle features an masterful sense of pacing, from the jacking propulsion of \"When a Fire Starts to Burn\" to the albums sweeping closer, \"Help Me Lose My Mind\". Dance musics long had a fickle relationship with the album format, but Settles impeccable sequencing leads to an album that begs to be heard in its entirety.\nSettles playful, high-energy attitude is sometimes reminiscent of Remedy, Basement Jaxxs star-making 1999 debut. The duos share divisive tendencies: Jaxxs brash and hyper-active production style rubs some the wrong way, and Disclosure have been called out for their clear debt to established UK dance styles. Specifically, Disclosure have been charged with riding the resurgence of the syncopated, R\u0026B-infused gait of late 1990s/early 2000s 2-step and UK Garage touchstones like MJ Coles \"Sincere\" and Hardrives \"Deep Inside\"; last month, they released an answer-song remix of 2-step kings Artful Dodgers \"Please Dont Turn Me On\"-- and this after after UKG veteran El-B offered his own dusty take on \"Boiling\" late last year, making the inspiration explicit.\nThe skepticism is understandable, to a point. UK dance culture has long prided itself on pushing things forward, and Disclosures arrival on the scene-- not to mention bass musics current retro-fixated house excursions-- marks the first time in many years that the freshest dance sounds from across the pond sound a little second-hand. Ultimately though, complaining about young artists reviving sounds that they werent around to experience the first time around is futile. Were a few years into an era where talented musicians are discovering influences new and old not through direct interaction with scenes but through their computers. And when the execution is this accomplished, its hard to get too hung up on the source material. Some of Settles giddiest highlights are clear UKG callbacks-- \"Voices\" and \"You \u0026 Me\", especially-- but Disclosure refuse to stick to any single genre. They effortlessly spin through romantic house (\"Defeated No More\", \"F For You\"), pitch-screwed bass music (\"Second Chance\"), and raunchy grime-inflected motifs (\"Confess to Me\"); nothing is off limits, and Settle is all the better for it.\nFor all its dance trappings, Settle is a pop record first and foremost, one that feels remarkably inclusive. The handful of male-led vocal cuts range from solid (Friendly Fires vocalist Ed MacFarlanes sultry take on \"Defeated No More\", Jamie Woons emotive pleading on \"January\") to showstopping (the indelible, effusive \"Latch\", Howard Lawrences surprisingly effective turn on \"F for You\"), but Settles array of female voices are the records nucleus. While a few notable names are used in surprising fashion-- folk-pop singer Lianne La Havas effusive, bleated samples on \"Stimulation\", Jessie Wares muted moves on \"Confess to Me\"-- the biggest star turns come from up-and-comers like Sasha Keable and London Grammars Hannah Reid, who shares a co-writing credit on \"Help Me Lose My Mind\". While listening to Settle, James Blakes 2011 quote about U.S. dubsteps \"frat-boy market\" came to mind; in 2013, it could be argued that such aggressively chauvinistic attitudes pervade many areas of big-tent dance culture, and its hard not to hear Settles wide-reaching accessibility as a potential antidote to the trend.\nSkirting dances more bass-heavy strands, Disclosure take a spare approach to sampling throughout Settle. They lift a few stray sounds from Kelis and Slum Village and, most curiously, motivational speaker and self-proclaimed \"hip-hop preacher\" Eric Thomas, whose impassioned delivery is featured on the albums intro as well as \"When a Fire Starts to Burn\". The video for the latter brings the sample to life visually and it turns out to be a strange reflection of its source material. As was recently noted, dance musics history contains frequent intersections, ideological and otherwise, with religion. Much like when dance-pop alchemists Hot Chip released their own devotional to the dancefloor in the form of last years stellar In Our Heads, Settles appeal ultimately owes something to its spiritual tinge. Disclosures unabashed pop sensibilities speak to the notion that music, as with a system of beliefs, can bring a diverse array of people-- the dance nerds and the poptimists, the club denizens and the festival obsessives, the perpetually stylish and the utterly clueless-- together as one. Settle is an album-length articulation of this idea, and its hard not to believe in that.",

        "article_text": "There are 11 songs on Sun Kil Moon’s astonishing sixth LP Benji, and in nearly all of them, somebody dies. And that’s not including the ones where someone’s on the verge of death or seriously headed towards it. Toddlers die, teenagers die, adults die, and the elderly die. They die of natural causes and in freak accidents. People die alone and people die by the dozens—handicapped children, single parents, grandmothers, serial killers. They die out of mercy and die long before they’re due. Rednecks die as respected men and white collar kids die in disgrace. But more importantly, Mark Kozelek wants us to know that they all lived, loved, fought, fucked up, and often did the best they could, before he sets out to “find some poetry to make some sense of this and give some deeper meaning” to their tragedies. Turns out he doesn’t have to dig very far. Here, Kozelek does away with the metaphor and verbal obfuscation often used to distract an audience from their own joy, sadness, crippling failures, and small triumphs. If listeners find themselves unable to make it through Benji in one piece, it’s because Kozelek all but forces us to recognize how the most emotionally moving art can be mapped directly on to our own lives.\nThis is a culmination of the jarring shift in Kozeleks work that started with 2012’s Among the Leaves, an erratic, occasionally embarrassing, and fascinating tell-all about a life in music. Whereas early songwriting in Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon resulted in elegant, poetic lyrics that demanded a hardbound, 256-page compilation, all of a sudden he was giving us songs about justifying a case of VD to his girlfriend, picking up water from 7-Eleven, and battling his own boredom with songwriting, all wrapped in songs with titles like “The Moderately Talented Yet Attractive Young Woman vs. the Exceptionally Talented Yet Not So Attractive Middle Aged Man\". It wasn’t a midlife crisis, exactly; it was more like watching your parents negotiate Facebook for the first time, equally excited and overwhelmed that they can share their daily minutiae but unaware of what to keep to themselves.\nBenji steps away from the focus on process in favor of songs that elevate exceedingly personal stories into universal displays of humanity. Presenting himself as no wiser, empathetic, or understanding than any of its subjects or his audience, Kozelek has crafted an album that anyone can feel but also one that, paradoxically, is filled with songs that wouldnt make sense if covered by anybody else. The opening “Carissa” is a portal towards the world Kozelek inhabits throughout Benji, all of it painfully real and subject to nature’s laws even as time seems frozen within it. The first line of Benji lays out the records confrontational realism: “Carissa, when I first saw you, you were a lovely child/ And the last time I saw you, you were 15 and pregnant and running wild.” We learn a few things about her: she’s Mark Kozelek’s second cousin, and in the 20 years since Kozelek’s seen her, she’s had two kids, settled into a nursing job in a nondescript Ohio town and, in general, gotten her shit together—a rarity in a Mark Kozelek song. And we also know that she dies in a fire after an aerosol can explodes in the trash.\nThat alone doesn’t make “Carissa” stand out, not in the catalog of one of our most prolific miserablists. But unlike Caroline or Elaine or Katy, Carissa has an effect on Kozelek that feels biological, that she’s a part of Kozelek’s flesh and blood and not just a muse, and he renders her story with detail that would be stunning for a novelist, let alone a songwriter. The chorus is sweetly sung and absolutely crushing: “Carissa was 35/ You don’t just raise two kids and take out your trash and die.” He’s right, that shouldn’t happen. Except the same exact thing happened to his uncle, which is detailed two songs later on “Truck Driver”.\nWhich leads to an important critical consideration: Do these songs resonate because we understand them to be true stories? We have little reason to doubt Kozelek’s authenticity, as Benji is full of proper nouns and historical facts that check out: Google some of the specificities mentioned during his eviscerating sexual inventory of “Dogs” and you find that there is indeed a Tangier and Red Lobster near the Erie Canal in Akron. When he calls his mom in \"Micheline\" and learns of his friend Brett’s death in 1999, he mentions booking a movie role—as the bassist from Stillwater in Almost Famous. At one point, he sings that “the Sopranos guy died at 51/ That’s the same age as the guy who’s coming to play drums,” and wouldn’t you know, former Sonic Youth stickman Steve Shelley, who played on the record, turns 52 in June. Kozelek’s reaction to both aerosol can-related deaths in his family are basically, “you can’t make this shit up.” But what if he did make this shit up? If so, Benji arguably becomes an even more impressive record—the debilitating emotional response created by “Carissa” and “Truck Driver” are undeniably real, and if the stories are fiction, the guy did his homework.\nRegardless of the real names and real events used throughout, nothing feels exploitative, unnecessary, or cruel the way some of the songs on Among the Leaves could. Nor is Benji subject to the navel-gazing self-importance that usually accompanies an aging musician making their “mortality” album. Despite most of it taking place in rural Ohio, people like Carissa and his uncle (“redneck that he was”) are never used as a stand-in for some salt-of-the-earth Middle American archetype or a cheap way to make some dippy point about us all being interconnected and carpe diem.  \nInstead, Benji trusts in the complexity and power ingrained in anyone’s life story rather than using them for some grand statement that glorifies Kozelek’s own perspective. Most importantly, his storytelling has sharpened considerably. Befitting someone who watches an absurd amount of boxing, Kozelek’s prose has taken on pugilistic bent, where he can go five minutes or more dancing around, softening the listener with sharp jabs before landing a catastrophic body blow. This is best exhibited on the song “Micheline”, which has three acts linked by nothing but their end result, and the one where his grandmother dies is the least tragic.\nThis is obviously brutal stuff, its pacing, themes, and structure having more in common with cinema or literature than pop music. But Benji is still a piece of entertainment and its a pleasure to listen to on that level. For one thing, its the most musically diverse and sonically direct album he’s made since disbanding Red House Painters. He’ll never return to the turbulent sound of the 1990s, though you get raw, gutbucket blues (“Dogs”, “Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes”), swanky, horn-laced yacht-pop (“Ben’s My Friend”), and a tender duet with Will Oldham (“I Can’t Live Without My Mother’s Love”), to name a few. And with its chipper harmonies and a fake Nels Cline solo (not Kozelek’s first joke at his expense), “I Love My Dad” feels like a ribbing at latter-day Wilco, a dad-rock song about his dad.\nSo Benji can be funny as hell, too: The effervescent narrative “Ben’s My Friend” snaps us back into the present day after the happy ending of “Micheline” and follows Kozelek as he suffers through writer’s block, a distracted lunch in a restaurant filled with “sports bar shit,” and a Postal Service concert where all the drunk kids with their cells appear to be “20 years younger.” He claims he’s too tired for the “backstage hi/bye” with pal Ben Gibbard and he heads back to his hot tub in Tahoe, before revealing the real cause for his meltdown: “I’m content, but there’s a tinge of competitiveness.” “I Love My Dad” finds Kozelek possibly outing himself as a recovering alcoholic (“I’ll have an O’Doul’s and my friend here will have a Guinness”) and a victim of child abuse, but its otherwise quotably hilarious, detailing a relationship with his father where valuable life lessons are imparted through both Iron Mike-style beatdowns and Edgar Winter records.\nBenji sounds more like Kozelek relating events instead of crafting them, which makes the continuity and reflexivity of the record feel both uncanny and the work of protracted genius. “Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes” was released months before it ended up as a thematic skeleton key on Benji, and it mentions a flight to Cleveland where he’ll be mourning a relative, which eventually became the inspiration for “Carissa”. “Ben’s My Friend” mentions a visit to Santa Fe that earlier served as the turning point of “I Watched the Film ‘The Song Remains the Same’”. On “I Love My Dad”, his father forces him to watch wrestling matches with a handicapped friend as a means of teaching him patience and the ability to shoot the shit and show respect for those in need. These lessons serves as the entire basis for “Jim Wise”. During that visit, they bring Jim food from Panera Bread and later you find out that Kozelek’s father likes to flirt with the girls there. As standalone pieces, “I Can’t Live Without My Mother’s Love” and “I Love My Dad” are  touching, heartfelt odes to his elderly parents and it’s interesting to notice the vast disparity in the tone of each: the latter is an elbow-poking, uncouth tribute to his father raising him to be the man that he is, while the former is a desperate plea for the parent that keeps him alive. \nNone of these things reveal themselves on the first listen but even after dozens, you never feel like youve exhausted Benjis secrets. The songs are stories, yes, but the kind that are told rather than read, ones you never hear the same way twice. I’ve heard the record compared to Winesburg, Ohio, a life-changing meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, the open-heart emotional surgery of Majical Cloudz’ Impersonator, and Kendrick Lamar’s character-driven opus good kid, m.A.A.d. City, which is indicative of the artistic merits of Benji, but also its ability to reach beyond the hardcore fanbase that has Kozelek has made no secret of his feelings towards as of late. Though Benji has few of the \"Behind the Music\" set pieces that marked Perils from the Sea, Admiral Fell Promises, and Among the Leaves, and it lacks his stage banters airing of grievances, this record slowly reveals itself as both a universal meditation on death and, very subtly, a recount of the life events that determined Mark Kozelek’s own artistic journey.  \n“Dogs” takes its title from a track on Pink Floyd’s Animals. Kozelek’s has consistently acknowledged how the classic rock of his youth has stuck with him, from AC/DC, Yes, Judas Priest to Led Zeppelin, who inspire Benji’s jaw-dropping centerpiece “I Watched the Film ‘The Song Remains the Same’”. Anyone whos seen Led Zeppelins profoundly dumbfounding medley of concert footage and Hammer of the Gods propaganda knows that the personal circumstances surrounding your viewing of the film is far more important than any of Zeps myth-making. Kozelek admits, \"I dont know what happened or what anyone did,\" and notes how the more pastoral, meditative \"The Rain Song\", \"Bron Yr Aur\", and \"No Quarter\" spoke to him more than the thunder of John Bonhams drumming or Jimmy Pages mahogany double-necked Gibson SG, leading him to conclude, \"from my earliest memories, I was a very melancholy kid.\"\nThree decades later, Kozelek cannot shake melancholy, will probably \"carry it to hell\", and in the meantime, uses \"I Watched the Film\"s deeply moving fingerpicking patterns (similar to “Bron Yr Aur”) to understand sadness pervasive grip on his life. The song ends with Kozelek promising a trip to Santa Fe to find the guy who gave him his first record deal—and yes, 4AD’s Ivo Watts-Russell really does live in Santa Fe. “Between my travel and his divorce,\" both have experienced their share of melancholy in the past two decades and have nothing to gain from each other anymore except a genuine connection and a moment to reflect. \nThat kind of sentiment represents the most profound shift that has occurred since Among the Leaves, when his interviews found him grousing about how his fans are “guys in tennis shoes” and reviews compare him to young, bearded troubadour-types like Jose Gonzalez and Bon Iver. He goes to Santa Fe for no other reason than to tell Watts, thank you. Fine then, someone does get used as a stand-in on Benji, because the record as a whole feels like him thanking not just his fans and supporters, but everyone who he’s come across in his life, by making good on his promise to give their lives poetry and deeper meaning. So while Benji is consumed with death, sadness, mourning, and tragedy, theres gratitude within all this melancholy and it’s actually Kozelek’s least depressing and most life-affirming record: when faced with an album that exposes so much of the beauty, truth, ugliness, humor, and grace inherent in simply existing in this world, the only response is to go out and live.",

        "article_text": "Whenever Death Grips get accused of bad intentions, they’re usually guilty of bad judgment. It’s easy to understand why people get offended by their dick moves, both literal and figurative. But for anyone invested in the group as an artistic entity, all of this retro and regressive Punk 101 chicanery serves as a distraction or a depletion from music that derives a purer shock value by sounding like it has no real precedent. If nothing else, their fourth album Government Plates is a reminder that, right, Death Grips make music! And it drops without any narrative context or controversy about its packaging, its label situation, or their disappearance from social media—like your parents, Death Grips have a Facebook page and unlike NO LOVE DEEP WEB or Sky Ferreira’s album, Government Plates  boasts a cover that won’t get you temporarily booted off the site. With a lack of external talking points and most of indie rocks ire currently being directed elsewhere, Government Plates  loudly reestablishes Death Grips as a group freed by having no ideals whatsoever, making music without a past about a present with no future.\nAnd here’s the squalid moment in which Death Grips find themselves: a bottle breaks, an air raid siren serves as MC Ride’s alarm clock, and he defaces his scrambled, arrhythmic rapping with batshit shrieking. Is it meant to suggest that he’s waking up from a bad dream? Or is he just being tasered mid-verse? As you might expect, Government Plates spends about half its time expressing its paranoia and the other half justifying it; enforcers are shadowy and lurking, their use of power always theoretical and impending, spelled out in the titles for people who have no interest in engaging with the thrilling music herein. But are we to cut through the battered radio soundclash of “Bootleg (Dont Need Your Help)” and the mesmerizing drones of seven-minute closer “Whatever I Want (Fuck Who’s Watching)” with Occam’s Razor and assume it’s all directed at Epic or concert promoters?\nYou could do that, though Government Plates functions as a Rorschach and not just because many of these songs are ugly, amorphous inky splatter. Throughout, Ride smears words and multiple meanings unwittingly tease themselves out—darting over and through Zach Hill’s drums like theyre a tire maze, Ride mutters “L.A. creeping under my skin,” or possibly “scales.” This is from “Big House”, so is the title an understood synonym for prison or a reference to how Death Grips blew Epic’s money by living at the Chateau Marmont? During “Birds”, is Ride saying “I got higher, I got fake”? Or is it, “I got hired, I got fake?”  “I got hired, I got paid”? Is it a critique of drugs, of corporate influence or a boast about how Death Grips have made a career largely out making people who give them money look stupid?\nIt’s easy to assume something this purposefully noided is Death Grips crafting a response, that they’ve been cornered by the music industry, expectations of fans, something on the outside. But to conclude that Death Grips are reacting to anything strips them of their unique power. You will learn nothing about how they feel about, say, about Obamacare, the NSA or Yeezus, a record that may have not been directly influenced by Death Grips but was likely aware of their existence. Death Grips may have endured a tough year, but they brought almost all of it upon themselves, and Government Plates is a pointedly proactive record that seeks out its own stimuli; and that’s why their pranks are nowhere near as interesting as their self-inflicted stunts. As with Bikram yoga or a hunger strike, artificially heightened circumstances help them realize internal purity.\nSo Government Plates isn’t defined by dissonance, volume, or abrasion so much as discomfort, Death Grips trying to figure out how to advance a sound that won’t stay still. “You might think he loves you for your money but I know what he really loves you for its your brand new leopard skin pillbox hat” is a good place to start. That’s an unwieldy title that at least has room to say everything it needs to. The song itself cramps what could otherwise be a wubbed-out dubstep appropriation into a gawky 6/8 meter. Ride discovers a staggered cadence that works between corroded pinwheel synths and drums that evoke the crunch of a stomped cockroach during “Anne Bonny”. Then the beat switches just to see if he’s willing to contort himself into its spaces (he accepts).   \nYou can certainly project anger onto Death Grips, it’s tough to imagine happy people making this kind of music.  But hey, might as well party at ground zero. Death Grips can actually be fun, or at least promise a payoff to all this stress. In that way, it recalls The Money Store, which in retrospect was the kind of album a major label would’ve been very pleased with after signing Death Grips, i.e., one with actual bars-and-hooks songs. Government Plates is also filled with hooks, if you remember that the word is also a synonym for a boxer connecting flush with your face. MC Ride is every bit as percussive as Zach Hill, and Zach Hill’s drums can prove to be a mouthpiece that’s more fluent and expressive than its human counterpart. “Two Heavens” and “Im Overflow” in particular are hip-hop as survivalist minimalism, merging little more than vocal texture and percussion into chest-puffing B-boy boasts.\nAnd hell, Death Grips can be kinda funny, too. You can’t be this premeditated with knowing what people think about you and if it wasn’t clear that a) there is a joke and b) Death Grips is in on it, there’s a song called “This is Violence Now (Dont get me wrong)”. Remember when MC Ride namedropped Magical Mystery Tour curiosity “Blue Jay Way” and Santana’s Abraxas on The Money Store?  If not, the first song on Government Plates is a Bob Dylan reference. If a Dadaist Death Grips nursery rhyme sounds hilarious in concept, that’s because “Birds” is pretty much just that. Ride sneers “I cop this attitude at all times,” in a posh, flippant accent, the kind attributable to someone vapid enough to say “I cop this attitude.”\nAn awkward one-off upon its original release, “Birds” serves as a pivot for Government Plates, the point where “new Death Grips” starts to become Death Grips doing something legitimately new. Some parts of Government Platesare actually pretty and not in that perverse, S\u0026M way. And during the second half, they get awfully close to proper dance music, or at least its rigorous structure and of course, this formalism makes for even more interesting tension. “Feels like a wheel” is Death Grips’ take on HI-NRG drum and bass, which is to say, it focuses less on emotional ecstasy than the artificial components and side effects of the club drug, the toxic chemicals and fried nerve endings. The only intelligible lyric is “let me live my life,” which turns the title into a double entendre, it could mean “rolling” or just being stuck. “Im overflow” about sums up how Death Grips react to stability and yet it hinges on Ride’s most straightforward battle rapping, punctuated with a yell of “hot shit!’  \nGovernment Plates isn’t here to teach you a lesson. When Death Grips are overt about what they think, they often come off like bratty teenagers, acting out against people who want to help them. Unlike the blunt, confrontational NO LOVE DEEP WEB, Government Plates lets you think for yourself and even if it doesn’t have an agenda, that doesn’t mean it’s nihilistic.  It’s music that doesn’t care about how you feel, just how you react to it. All the same, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum and when Death Grips interact with the public, they can produce something elemental, in a literal sense where the periodic table can take violent turns: oxidation, sulfur fumes, nitrous, horrible fluorescents and neon, fossil fuel. Or, maybe a hydrogen bomb, with all of its attendant amorality: Death Grips provide the power, you provide the politics.",

        "article_text": "Few electronic artists from the last decade have been pigeonholed like William Bevan. Since the London producer behind Burial gained widespread attention with 2007s epochal second album, Untrue, listeners and critics alike have spoken of \"the Burial sound\"—pitched-down vocal samples, rustling noise, blocky garage rhythms in perpetual decay—as if it were straight gospel. This is partially Bevans fault: four years passed before any new solo material saw release, which allowed plenty of time for Untrues singular aura to seep into the collective consciousness. As imitators big and small have lined up to pay respect, the phrase \"sounds like Burial\" escaped the connotation of wishful thinking and started sounding almost like, well, an insult.\nInsulting because, as this decade so far has proven, one person who doesnt sound like Burial anymore is Burial himself. 2011s Street Halo EP, which followed a 12\" collaboration with Four Tet, offered a few engaging structural tweaks to Untrues formula, but it was the collab EP with Massive Attack that followed later in the year, \"Four Walls\" b/w \"Paradise Circus\", that hinted Bevan was ready to explore truly new territory. Essentially a pair of Burial edits of songs from Massive Attacks 2010 LP Heligoland, each cut pushed past the 11-minute mark and embraced a proggy, amorphous structure that was worlds away from the contained environments of previous Burial releases. If the Massive Attack edits suggested a shift away from the past, 2012s astounding pair of EPs, Kindred and Truant/Rough Sleeper, broke free of any previously set constraints, as Bevan wielded his newfound appreciation for side-long track lengths and added splashes of sonic color—arpeggiated synths, chunky house motifs, rickety windchimes, bursts of beatific melody—to his established palette of blues and grays.\nOver the last few years, the only consistent aspect of Burials music is the frequency of when its been released—typically and almost too fittingly, in the dead of winter—so the excitement that arrives with the announcement a new Burial release in 2013 is no longer \"It exists!,\" but \"What is this going to sound like?\" Rival Dealer arrives almost exactly a year after Truant/Rough Sleeper, but the stylistic leaps made on this new release are more jarring and revelatory than anything in Burials catalog. Its unquestionably his strongest release since Kindred, and his most satisfying statement of purpose since Untrue.\nThe seismic stylistic shift that Bevans made on these three tracks—two of which, true to recent form, run well over the 10-minute mark—is immediately apparent on the opening minutes of Rival Dealers title track, when a distorted vocal sample of adult-contemporary cheeseball Gavin DeGraws \"More Than Anyone\" (yes, really) gives way to a furious drum break, making for Burials most straightforwardly uptempo move to date. The rhythm simultaneously sounds crisp and hissing, eventually disintegrating in a blare of police-scanner noise before everything goes truly pear-shaped with a monstrous, buzzing bassline, as a woodblock rhythm from the Untrue days clicks and clacks below the chaos. In the few interviews that Bevan has given throughout his career, hes outlined Burials conceptual aims as a tribute to the rave music he didnt get a chance to grow up with but experienced second-hand; the unbridled intensity of \"Rival Dealer\" is arguably his most explicitly rave-y move yet.\n\"Rival Dealer\"s final, impressionistic third is the one section on Rival Dealer that dips into familiar Burial territory, with meditative synths and stray vocal samples briefly interrupted by a radiant saxophone line. Its a necessary comedown after all the preceding intensity, as well as a teaser for what follows: \"Hiders\" and \"Come Down to Us\", the EPs following two cuts, are the source of Rival Dealers most mind-blowing moments, as well as being the closest that Bevans come to total accessibility since Untrues earwormy lead single \"Archangel\". The EPs other side-long epic, \"Come Down to Us\", takes cues from the crawling sense of pacing established on the Massive Attack edits, with a rhythm so slow it barely registers on the BPM scale stretched across 13 minutes, as a slinky sitar-like figure and piping synths give way to a sparkly, unnervingly sentimental soft-rock melody, the sounds of drizzling rain coating the whole thing.\nIf \"Come Down to Us\" is Bevan laying out conventional melodic forms across his template of psychedelic sprawl, \"Hiders\" is 2010s-Burial in miniature form, his only sub-five-minute solo cut of the decade thus far and one of the only true standalone tracks in his catalog (not an insult—hes a deep-listening artist at this point). It opens with an anthemic synth figure that starts and stops several times, returning each time with varying fidelity, before a splashy arena-rock drumbeat crashes through the ambience, stepping in time with the cascading synth figure and a vocal sample that seems to hover just slightly above everything else. The beatific, neon \"Hiders\" is Bevans take on the more loved-up element of rave music—if \"Rival Dealer\" is a tip to the days of Kool FM, then this is more along the lines of the stuff spun by DJs like Scott Hardkiss and Danny Rampling—but even those without a lick of dance history know-how will be wowed by \"Hiders\" magnificent aura, a down-to-the-buzzer entry as one of 2013s most surprising musical moments.\nRival Dealer has some of the most immediate music from the Burial project, but its worth noting that this is also a noisy, dissonant work. Tape hiss and static smother large sections of the EP, and Bevan seriously tips the scales when it comes to one of the staples of Burials style, as well as rave music at large—the vocal sample. He liberally applies voices all over the three tracks, both as a structural anchor and to create a pleasing cacophony; during \"Rival Dealer\"s coruscating midsection, he throws in a sample of New York rapper Lord Finesses \"You Know What Im About\" in a showoff-y, very un-Burial fashion. Burial has often been praised for restraint; the wild-eyed, play-anything nature of Rival Dealer shatters that notion for the better.\nSpeaking of vocal samples: a theme that runs through Rival Dealer, upheld by the many voices that dot its landscape, is self-acceptance. Phrases concerning sexuality and personal reflection abound—\"This is the moment when you see who you are,\" \"Its about sexuality, its about showing a person who you are—to me, this is who Im about,\" \"This is who I am,\" \"Who are you?\". \"Come Down to Us\", in particular, ends with an extended lift of a passage from transgender filmmaker Lana Wachowskis painfully moving speech while receiving the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award last year.\nSome have already speculated that Bevans framing here is intentional, possibly speaking to his own personal experiences. Whatever the case, \"Come Down to Us\" is Rival Dealers nucleus, as its titular vocal sample appears throughout the EP. The fact that such guesswork takes place to begin with is evidence of how, after nearly a decade of making music, William Bevan continues to fascinate and create intrigue. Here, he provides plenty of exciting material to pore over until he returns, further changing our perspective on an artist were still just starting to understand.",

        "article_text": "Modern indie rock generally treats emotion as something that should be guarded or disguised. The Monitor does not subscribe to this viewpoint. On their second album, New Jerseys Titus Andronicus split the emotional atom with anthemic chants, rousing sing-alongs, celebrations of binge drinking, marathon song titles, broken-hearted duets, punked-up Irish jigs, and classic rock lyric-stealing. And through it all, they take subtlety out on the town, pour a fifth of whiskey down its throat, write insults on its face in permanent marker, and abandon it in the woods.\nLoosely based on the U.S. Civil War, The Monitor may be one of the most absurd album concepts ever, invoking the battle that caused Abraham Lincoln to claim, \"I am now the most miserable man living,\" to illustrate the sound and fury of suburban Jersey life in a shattered economy. In the annals of using historical metaphors for emotional communication, its up there with Jeff Mangum empathizing with Anne Frank. But it all turns out so ridiculously fun-- with Ken Burns-style readings of speeches from Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, daguerreotype cover art, and song titles all participating in the reenactment-- that it never even begins to approach the pretentiousness these elements might suggest.\nIn the end, the Civil War is just a recurring theme, and one thats more personal than political. For stadium-rock inspiration, Titus Andronicus look no further than their home-state hero, paraphrasing Bruce Springsteen in the first song and name-checking him in the last. And while the central muse is obvious, theres a full menu of influences on display. Theres the Hold Steady in its mythology of intoxication, the Pogues in its cathartic singalong gutter-punk, and Conor Obersts Desaparacidos in its brazen earnestness. Theres also the fatalistic fuck-all of early Replacements and the brutalist thrashing of east-coast hardcore in its violent instrumentation and apocalyptic worldview.\nSomehow that laundry-list of inspirations all manage to make an appearance in the first two minutes of leadoff track \"A More Perfect Union\". After an opening half thats equal parts slop and ambition, the album turns a corner on \"A Pot in Which to Piss\" and settles into a reliable pattern, each song building from frontman Patrick Stickles self-described \"piss and moan\" to a punk-rock fury, and finally to an instrumental call-to-arms. The repeated structure feeds the albums narrative arc and provides some much-needed breathers, until the records big finale. At 14 minutes, \"The Battle of Hampton Roads\" adds a couple of extra Xs to the already XL project: Oscillating even more wildly between the albums twin poles of suicidal ideation and vengeance fantasies, Stickles builds to his frothiest moment, spilling it all out in a verse that rivals Neutral Milk Hotels \"Oh Comely\" for uncomfortable honesty. And in the end theres a bagpipe solo.\n\"The enemy is everywhere,\" Stickles keeps reminding us over the course of the record. Its difficult to tell what that enemy is, as Stickles target moves from social anxiety to pure boredom to the symbolic frat-brahs of \"Hampton Roads\". But as the casualties pile up and the battle hymns keep egging on the troops, it becomes clear that the opponent isnt nearly as important as the fight itself. Catharsis is Stickles fuel, and The Monitor is a 65-minute endorsement of angst and opposition as the best way to present that combustible sorrow: Light it with footlights, throw a giant shadow against the back wall, and rock the fuck out of it.",

        "article_text": "Unlike many of 2009s breakout indie bands, Vancouvers Japandroids werent hanging onto their youth out of nostalgia. For this duo, it literally sounded like a matter of life and death. While the chaotic, fist-pumping anthems of Post-Nothing were as reckless, hormonal, and pleasure-obsessed as any teenager, escapism wasnt an option. Singer/guitarist Brian King and drummer David Prowse have admitted that Japandroids were shutting down the operation after years of going nowhere, and Post-Nothing was as meant as a swan song more than a debut. And for a half hour, they played with the desperation of young men about to lose something vital forever. That urgency is rarely a renewable resource, so as more time passed between the excellent 2010 single \"Younger Us\" and Post-Nothings follow-up, the more worrisome its lyrics became. Where they had once vowed to go into adulthood kicking and screaming, had they survived only to surrender? That was the question every time King began a verse with what Tony Soprano called the lowest form of conversation: \"Remember when?\"  \n\"Younger Us\" is now the sixth song on the awe-inspiring Celebration Rock, and nothing has changed except how its context raises the possibility that it doesnt actually have to be about them. This shift in perspective is crucial to understanding how Celebration Rock can somehow manage to completely dwarf its impressive predecessor despite being made the same exact way-- same personnel, same producer, same minimal-overdub policy, same instruments, same eight-song tracklist. Hell, even the covers pretty much the same. But in writing about something other than the experience of being Japandroids, the duo taps into a power greater than itself to address impossibly vast and elemental topics-- friendship, lust, revenge, art, self-actualization-- with songs every bit as big. The uptick in ragged and resonant guitar-based indie rock has dredged up a lot of deserved Replacements comparisons, but I dont think anythings captured their spirit to the extent of Celebration Rock: its the Mats who had the chops to pay homage to Big Star, the irreverence to cover \"Black Diamond\", and the empathy to write \"Sixteen Blue\".\nCombined with the revved-up riff on opener \"The Nights of Wine and Roses\", Kings first lyric (\"Long lit up tonight/ And still drinking/ Dont we have anything to live for?/ Well of course we do/ But until they come true/ Were drinking\") recalls a time when the Hold Steady shot for something similar. But whether it was their tendency to write from a storytelling perspective or generally avoid choruses in favor of inside jokes, the Hold Steady always created some sort of distance from the listener. Ive never been fully convinced that Craig Finn and co. wrote about people whod actually listen to their music. Not so here, where Japandroids take on something like a Woody Guthrie anthropological approach. \"On a lot of this new record, we actually tried to simulate the sound of what we thought the crowd would do during the songs,\" King told us in an interview back in March. \"Dave and I were in the studio just screaming out as if we were in the audience at our own show.\"\nAnd indeed, Japandroids are dealing with the real populist stuff on Celebration Rock. Sometimes the roots are exposed; \"American Girl\" gets a nod during the cow-punk rodeo of \"Evils Sway\" and \"Adrenaline Nightshift\" follows in the footsteps of the Replacements \"Alex Chilton\", honoring the lineage of transformative rock music by adding to it. But mostly, its in how Celebration Rock treats every day like the last day of school, raising a glass to the past, living in the moment and going into the future feeling fucking invincible. It offers itself up as a social lubricant, music meant for radios, keg parties, road trips; the extent to which plural pronouns exceed singular is no accident. \nAnd this is all achievable since the first thing you take from Celebration Rock is just how much theyve improved in terms of capturing pure sound, everything hitting louder and clearer than before. Post-Nothing was an emotional blast and also a sonic blur, Prowse and King recreating their cramped live show to the point where they may as well have been in mono. Likewise, some songs lived and died on a single riff or lyric. Celebration Rock remains structurally minimal but incredibly dense, fashioning a bionic kind of rock music from the best parts without a moment that lacks crowd-pleasing purpose. The verse melodies take more chances and any time a guitar chord suspends, theres almost always a windup of a drum fill anticipating the duo gleefully throwing themselves into a flashmob-like chorus. If Celebration Rock were much longer than 35 minutes, it might actually be exhausting, the emotional and melodic onslaught so overwhelming that a Gun Club cover of all things is the only time you might be able to catch your breath between the fireworks that begin and end the record.\nBut \"For the Love of Ivy\" cleaves Celebration Rock in a way that makes structural sense. The first half feels like the one obsessed with classic rock legacy, and initially youre left reeling from the wallop of \"Fires Highway\" and \"The Nights of Wine and Roses\"s haymaker hooks. There are micro-level pleasures to appreciate too-- the Tom Petty rip might get the crowd going, but that little pivot before the chorus of \"Evils Sway\" where it shifts from a breakneck rant to a major-key bridge is really where I hear a band making a huge leap in songwriting technique. \nThats even more evident in terms of lyrics, where Japandroids have gone from having almost none at all to packing their songs with an astonishing command of legend and literalism that all but dares you to feel something. Everything burns brighter than it does in reality here (\"sexual red\" is their color of choice) and most human interactions are likened to explosions. Whats the \"Adrenaline Nightshift\"? Its a \"generations bonfire,\" the affection of a girl with \"a blitzkrieg love and a Roman candle kiss.\" Still unsure? How about \"theres no high like this.\" I cant intelligently describe \"hearts from hell\" or why they \"collide on fire highways tonight\" but I dont have to. \"We dreamed it now we know,\" King belts and if you dont know, just wait for the guitar solo which doesnt play notes so much as release a blue streak of endorphins. Now you know.\nWhile Celebration Rock is undoubtedly a fun record, it earns its spot amongst their heroes by discovering its emotional ballast during the near-perfect Side B. \"Adrenaline Nightshift\" and \"Younger Us\" are psychologically complex songs about simple pleasures of music and companionship that generate the momentum required for \"The House That Heaven Built\", the crest of Celebration Rocks rising action and the pinnacle of their songwriting. Over its five minutes, \"House\" grows increasingly heavy without any adding any superficial layers, Prowses militant drum beat multiplying into tense fills, Kings single guitar chord doubling over itself and a near telepathic vocal interplay delivering maybe the most inspiring of Celebration Rocks life-affirming credos: \"When they love you and they will/ (And they will!)/ Ill tell em all theyll love in my shadow.\" Whether its an unappreciative boss, an unfeeling lover, or just a hometown youve outgrown, Japandroids got your back. Throughout \"The House That Heaven Built\", you hear a band accumulating enough confidence to deliver the valedictory message of an album where 95% of the lyrics are immediately available for a senior yearbook quote: \"Its a lifeless life with no fixed address to give/ But youre not mine to die for anymore/ So I must live.\"\nThis leads into the relatively restrained \"Continuous Thunder\", the one song here Im really tempted to misread so as to apply it to Japandroids themselves. Theres a devastating admission in the bridge that bookends the intro from \"The Nights of Wine and Roses\" (\"If I had all of the answers/ And you had the body you wanted/ Would we love with a legendary fire?\"), and the opening line, \"The hearts terrain is never a prairie/ But you werent wary/ You took my hand,\" is obviously addressed to a hesitant partner. But it plays to the overarching theme of being fearless in the face of doubt. Of course Japandroids couldnt act with the same urgency they did on Post-Nothing-- theyre not in the same desperate situation, and they boldly manifest the confidence of having survived near-death experiences as human beings and as a band.\nItd be nice to think that Post-Nothing was inevitably too good to be ignored, but as a very untrendy band in a city with little support for live music, the odds were stacked against them. One lame show in front of the wrong crowd, the wrong choice of a single falling on the wrong set of ears, and that couldve been it, just as they planned it. And yet, they went ahead anyway and soon found themselves playing to rooms full of people who dont have the answers, dont have the body they want, and have plenty of dreams that may never come true. But so what? Whether its a result of faith in religion, in rocknroll, or another human being, two completely normal people can love each other with a legendary fire and its no more ridiculous than two dudes pushing 30 years old from Vancouver called Japandroids making a rock record for the ages. You can be ambivalent about yourself but believe in something bigger, and the message is right there in the title: On Post-Nothing, Japandroids were worried about dying. This is a celebration of being alive. ",

        "article_text": "In his decade-long career, Caribous Dan Snaith has fluidly moved between genres like folktronica, shoegaze, krautrock, and 1960s sunshine pop, assimilating their most familiar traits until theyre practically in his DNA. His albums have felt warm, loose, and ecstatic (especially 2003s still-career-best Up in Flames), despite Snaiths behind-the-boards meticulousness.\nSnaiths latest, Swim, is even heavier on the precise sonic detail, and its all the more impressive for it. Made with help from kindred spirits including Four Tets Kieran Hebden, Junior Boys Jeremy Greenspan, and Born Ruffians Luke Lalonde, it was borne out of a desire to create \"dance music that sounds like its made out of water.\" Swim is darker both in tone and spirit than its predecessor, 2007s day-glo Andorra, swapping expansive drum-circle arrangements and ebullience for chilly rhythms and a bummed-out disposition. Easy entrance points here are scarcer than on any of Snaiths previous full-lengths-- as with 2005s kraut-centric The Milk of Human Kindness, repeat listens are key.\nThe record kicks off with its most accessible moment, \"Odessa\". Seasick bass, snatches of flute and guitar, and Snaiths mannered patter combine to give the song a pop-centric lean. But the songs easy appeal makes it easy to miss important details, like the ghosted acid-house bleat and lyrics about a break-up (\"Taking the kids/ Driving away/ Turning round the life she let him siphon away\") that establish Swims bleary-eyed atmosphere. Lyrically, Snaith seems preoccupied with relationship-related indecision and ennui-- a noticeable departure from Andorras moony-eyed devotionals. On the LPs other highlight, \"Kaili\", Snaith muses on a couple ruefully growing old together. Elsewhere, divorce and crumbling relationships permeate \"Found Out\" (whose female protagonist suffers hopelessness as \"she knows shell be there on her own\") and empty-nest song \"Hannibal\".\nLonely feelings abound, as Snaith employs textures and compositional tricks from minimal techno, house, and disco to convey this distant melancholia. The harshly juxtaposed interplay of beats on \"Found Out\" make for punch-drunk club music, \"Leave House\" unfolds with LCD Soundsystems dance-rock know-how, and the warning horns of \"Hannibal\" give way to a sequined breakdown deserving of any side-long disco edit. Unlike many artists who attempt to dive headlong into the genre, Snaith demonstrates a deep understanding of dance music-- not just how it works, but why, right down to its most pleasurable idiosyncratic tics.\nThis historians grasp, combined with the way Snaiths soft, out-of-phase vocals seem to hover over his productions, inevitably brings to mind Arthur Russell. But while Russells spirit is indeed felt throughout Swim, Snaiths sonic heart still belongs to hash-laced psych, from the drone and Gong-worthy chimes that run through \"Bowls\" to the vocal chants that break up \"Sun\"s tech-house throb. Proof that, despite his chameleonic tendencies, Dan Snaith retains his singular identity as an artist-- and Swim is a reminder that even at his most challenging, the mans compositional capabilities can dazzle.",

        "article_text": "Swedens Radio Dept. have spent their career to date quietly building up a devoted fanbase by filtering traditional indie and dream-pop sounds through an electronic haze. Theyve admirably honored their genres history every step of the way, incorporating elements of vintage Slumberland noise-pop, sadder 80s UK indie sounds, and the kind of romantic, low-key dance-pop typically associated with Saint Etienne, or more recently, the Tough Alliance. The bands relatively low profile is partly due to the infrequency of their output: Up to now, theyve released only two LPs throughout their 13-year career, along with a handful of EPs and singles.\nAs with their last two albums, Clinging to a Scheme stands to further expand the Radio Dept.s cult. Economy has never been an issue for the band, but here, things are further tightened up: Clocking in at just 34 minutes, this album is their shortest and most finely-tuned yet, moving at a rapid clip while maintaining a sense of balance and even pacing-- a pretty remarkable show of restraint and dedication for a record that has ostensibly been in the works for four years. (Their last full-length, Pet Grief, was released way back in 2006.) The improved fidelity helps, too: These songs sparkle with striking clarity in contrast to past works, while retaining all the glowing, sun-soaked ambiance thats become a signature.\nClinging to a Scheme shows the Radio Dept. working with an extended range of sounds. While the core elements of these songs will be plenty familiar to longtime fans, the band manages to tweak the formula slightly for each track. The sparkly, Balearic \"Heavens on Fire\" and the downbeat dub of \"Never Follow Suit\" are clear highlights, particularly on first spin. But repeat plays reveal this records almost bottomless depth, as different tracks and subtle elements gradually reveal themselves with each listen: The sugar-rushed urgency of \"This Time Around\" or the complex \"David\", which is sunny and bright musically but lyrically wistful, are just two of eight other reasons this album rewards every ounce of attention you give it.\nGreat songs, higher fidelity: It should be a recipe for contentment, yet frontman Johan Duncanson remains discouraged by lifes challenges. \"Seemed like a good idea at one time/ But now its all wrong,\" he sings on opener \"Domestic Scene\", and it doesnt get any cheerier from there. Although the Radio Dept. werent regularly active until 1998, the project was concieved by Duncanson three years earlier along with a few schoolmates; in other words, his lyrics have been rooted in boyhood melancholia since day one. Duncanson doesnt show any signs of leaving that behind on Clinging to a Scheme, uttering lines in \"A Token of Gratitude\" that evoke pure melodrama: \"Do I love you?/ Yes, I love you/ But easy come, easy go.\"\nBut thats part of The Radio Dept.s charm and identity, and the music itself is generally brighter, which makes for an engaging contrast while preventing the tone of the songs from becoming maudlin. The strongest moments on Clinging to a Scheme, such as the aforementioned \"Heavens on Fire\" and \"Never Follow Suit\", are effortlessly catchy and upbeat. Album closer \"You Stopped Making Sense\" is especially cloud-clearing, as Duncanson hits his upper register among deliciously bent guitar strings, moaning about another love lost. Its a bittersweet ending for Clinging to a Scheme, but for the Radio Dept.s already decade-plus career, it may be a whole new beginning.",

        "article_text": "Delorean helped define the bright, beachside vibe of last summers indie landscape, but they also deserve to be placed in a broader context. On their new album, Subiza, the Spanish four-piece deploys the build-and-burst tempos of 90s house and techno music, and they do so explicitly, never shying away from arms-in-the-air piano bridges or incandescent raves. This music is proudly informed by the resiliency and vigor of classic club music, and its title (named after the Basque town in which the album was recorded) recalls the famously nightclub-centric Ibiza and the Balearic dance music that originated there.\nDeloreans musical growth isnt far removed from the evolution of Primal Scream. Like Delorean, Primal Scream were a dance-rock band with more traditional, rock-leaning origins (Delorean formed as a no-frills indie group) who ended up embracing druggy dance subculture. Over time, Screamadelica became a part of the 1990s pop firmament to the point where it no longer sounds like a blending of much of anything. Depending on which ways the trend-winds blow, observers may one day question why Subiza was ever labeled as anything more than uptempo indie rock.\nThe band definitely has that pedigree, crafting four- and five-minute verse/chorus pop songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi has a slightly pinched, accented delivery that lends intrigue and emotional resonance to lines like \"Would you ever make yourself this decision Ive made?\" (from \"Grow\"). Sonically, Delorean borrow from chilled trance and piano-heavy Italian house, but like any music fan in 2010, their interests are varied. The pitch-shifted chipmunk vocals that orbit \"Real Love\" are drawn from hip-hop; the warped female voice that echoes \"Maybe\" during the refrain of \"Grow\" is lifted from dubstep. Theres more than a little Merriweather Post Pavilion in the whirring rave of \"Infinite Desert\". The band even runs a club-heavy blog, and when theyre not playing live, their massive DJ sets feature faintly familiar house tracks that hit a perfect nostalgic nerve.\nDeloreans 2009 EP, Ayrton Senna, was recorded in-studio, but for Subiza, the band made a conscious move toward electronic production, laying down dozens of tracks and building the rhythms on sequencers and drum machines. The overall sound remains similar to Ayrton Sennas totemic dance-pop, but Subiza feels tighter and more congealed. What the songs lose in clarity (ratchet those vocal levels down a bit, guys), they gain in cohesion: Subiza is uncommonly bound by tempo and mood. While hardly modest, Delorean have toned down their anthems, so that much of Subiza feels like a very tiny, very personal rave.\nSubiza sounds like a simple and straightforward record. Its bright and quick and full of easy sentiment. Its songs bleed in and out of one another effortlessly, but its also surprisingly varied. It contains few obvious singles, yet its winning moments-- those piano breakdowns, the \"Get up/ Get up/ Get up\" bridge of \"Stay Close\", and the resplendent chorus of \"Warmer Places\"-- pile up and leave you dizzy. Synth-pop, Balearic disco, indie house: Call it what you want. Delorean just make beautiful, modern pop music.",

        "article_text": "After all of the awful shit Crystal Castles did in the wake of their success, a whole lot of people hoped their new album would be terrible. Sorry, haters: 2010s Crystal Castles improves on their (also self-titled) debut in nearly every way. The latest from the Toronto-based electro duo is reminiscent of the jump forward taken by Deerhunter between Cryptograms and Microcastle, or Fuck Buttons from Street Horrrsing to Tarot Sport. Like those acts, Crystal Castles have reconciled with their detractors instead of running from them. By staying true to themselves, theyve created a more focused, propulsive, and satisfying follow-up.\nSome listeners might miss the sonic shock that came from hearing the sub-zero Italo chill of \"Magic Spells\" sequenced next to the 8-bit electrocution of \"Xxzxcuzx Me\", but clashes like those wore out their welcome over the span of 16 tracks. Here, Crystal Castles embrace continuity and broaden their dynamic range beyond the primitive loops that once constituted the foundations of their songs. The core elements of first single \"Celestica\", for example, are pure shoegaze, but the waves of distortion that scrape across its chorus squash any concerns that the duo has gone soft. For a band known for its harsh midrange, this record reveals a surprising amount of depth in headphones.\nCrystal Castles are far more pop than before, too, which was probably an inevitable move, but hardly a bad one. Like \"Celestica\", \"Suffocation\" and \"Empathy\" mix fanged distortion and sparkly synths, while tracks like \"Vietnam\", \"Not in Love\", \"Intimate\", and the rave-tinged \"Baptism\" arm the record with loads of could-be singles. But despite this shift toward beauty and clarity, Crystal Castles still rip into some punishing, epileptic moments, like the distorted bass riff on \"Birds\" and the shredded brutality of \"Doe Deer\". The fluidity of the music is matched by Alice Glass frequently manipulated vocals, a showcase for someone too often pigeonholed as a bratty screamer. She sounds at times like everything from a Leslie guitar (\"Empathy\") to a Cloverfield-style monster (\"I Am Made of Chalk\"). The obvious comparison is the Knifes Silent Shout, but where Karin Dreijer-Andersson often manipulates her voice to play characters, Glass is just as disturbing for her dehumanization.\nAs rewarding as this new album is, its even more impressive when you consider its context: Crystal Castles may have come on at the tail-end of the blog-house/nu-rave/French-touch mini-rage, but theyve now transcended it, moving from scene linchpin to indie stars. The reason is simple: Crystal Castles are a singular act who rarely sound like anyone other than themselves. So just as Ladytrons The Witching Hour did for electroclash in 2005, Crystal Castles seems destined to close the door on a fleeting, once-fashionable genre in the best way possible: by making an artistic leap beyond its boundaries.",

        "article_text": "Notice Lonnie Lynns expression on the cover of his new record. Its not a smirk or a simper or even a smile-- its a full-on grin. Bathed in a golden hue, the image is an instant-vintage snapshot of the sincerity and canny idealism that has marked Commons 13-year hip-hop career. As other MCs fall by the conscious curbside due to nascent acting careers (Mos Def, Andre 3000) or misguided mainstream pleas (Talib Kweli, the Roots), this Chicago native rebounds from 2002s botched hip-hop-flower-child experiment Electric Circus with the help of fellow Windy City native Kanye West on Be, which comfortably ranks alongside Resurrection and Like Water for Chocolate as Commons best work to date.\nThe album introduces itself with a few somber, contemplative notes from an upright bass. Then the heavy strings awake from their slumber and start popping. A slurring analog keyboard line slides in. Juke joint piano begins to roll. \"Yes,\" Common says with a resounding confidence that instantly placates any holdover Electric Circus worries. Elevated by the melodic burst of the quintessential West beat, Common proceeds to dole out his State of Urban America Address: \"Bush pushin lies/ Killers immortalized/ We got arms but wont reach for the skies.\" With no hook and a cold Chi-town setting where \"drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones,\" Bes intro is inviting, stern, buoyant, and level-headed all at once, establishing a theme of restrained optimism.\nIts deftly followed by the crack-a-lack street symphony \"The Corner\". \"We write songs about wrong because its hard to see right,\" Common intones, alongside his legendary heroes the Last Poets. Guided by the tenants of his classic hip-hop parable \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\", the wise MC is not preaching, just leisurely speaking, playing the world-weary yet still-hopeful ghetto documentarian. Still gazing into his daughters eyes for inspiration as he did on Like Water for Chocolates \"The 6th Sense\", Common, at the near-ancient hip-hop age of 33, refreshingly looks to generations both past and future for the answers to the big questions hes searching for on Be.\nNowadays, Common wont leave you slack-jawed at his meta-metaphor verbal gymnastics. His flow is slowed and smoothed out, with understated emphasis and emotion taking the place of young-buck flashiness. The lack of instant-gratification couplets may disappoint at first, but each verses rewarding intricacies become more evident with multiple listens.\nSonically, Be is utterly listenable: With just 11 songs in 42 minutes (including Pops rap), the record is as succinct as its title. Bes brevity is not only welcomed but almost iconoclastic. Making the album speed by even faster is the intrinsic sense of continuity provided by West and the like-minded J Dilla. The famed dropouts nine tracks feature his signature sound with slight unconventional arrangement twists and scratch-down turns that prevent dull uniformity: Instead of a third verse on the two-sided adulterous saga \"Faithful\", the song segues into a celestial duet with John Legend tethered to the hook while wily eccentric Bilal soars above with his melismatic vocal theatrics.\nOnce a pupil of Chicago producer No I.D., who helped construct Commons early boom-bap sound, West does his mentor proud on Be, exuberantly pushing his one-time lyrical foe to unleash superior oratory skills while cutting-and-pasting archaic soul samples from forgotten artists such as gospel-tinged loverman DJ Rogers (\"Faithful\") and familial funk group Cornelius Brothers \u0026 Sister Rose (\"Chi City\"). Aside from the horn-laden \"Real People\", which nicks 70s organist Caesar Fraziers \"Sweet Children\" wholesale, West once again proves himself to be an inventive, natural talent behind the boards, as on \"The Food,\" which flips the opening notes of Sam Cookes \"Nothing Can Change This Love\" for its infectious piano loop.\nThere are no skippable songs on Be, but one decision disrupts the albums admirably consistent 68-degrees-in-the-shade vibe: The inclusion of the \"Chappelles Show\" version of \"The Food\". Though the live take has an intensity missing on the studio version (released on vinyl last year), the Chappelle introduction and opening and closing applause pull the listener out of Bes palpable Southside surroundings. The album would have been better served by a redone studio take on the tune, which had the potential to be one of Bes finest.\nPicayune flaws aside, the albums appeal stems from Commons passionate honesty. This invigorating trait means ballads like \"Love Is...\" and \"Its Your World\" dont melt into mush. The former sees him talking tender over a sinuous J Dilla beat that layers airy Marvin Gaye vocal samples atop each other to sublime effect. \"Some say that Im a dreamer because I talk about it often/ Seen the hardest nigga soften with his homey in a coffin,\" he says, admitting his romantic weaknesses while concurrently highlighting the inevitable downsides of such boundless affections. The latter features an unflinching, detailed narrative chronicling a downtrodden Midwestern prostitutes sympathetic plight: \"I remember in high school, she had a passion to sing/ Now she see herself in her casket in dreams.\"\nThe womans tale can be seen as a dreadful sequel to hip-hops own plight in \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" More than a decade after that distillation of the pitfalls of the culture, hip-hop continues to relish in the violent and abusive tropes at an increasingly overt level. Still, Common lends power and self-worth to the character in \"Its Your World\", hoping she can use it to her advantage-- but also realizing her fate may be sealed. \"She still wanna see California,\" he concludes. Whether she ever makes it is left lovingly, realistically unanswered.\n ",

        "article_text": "About a year ago, it seemed easy to predict what Dylan Baldis first great album would probably sound like. After the release of the Turning On, a self-recorded collection of CD-Rs filled with tuneful alt-punk songs wrapped in tinfoil and steel wool that was released by the tiny California imprint Bridgetown Records, Cloud Nothings self-titled debut on Carpark was an identifiable point on a familiar trajectory. The clarity afforded even by its modest budget made sweet and airy singles like \"Forget You All the Time\" and \"Should Have\" sound revelatory, while more overtly aggro tracks like \"Rock\" and \"Not Important\" felt thin and regressive, unnecessary vestiges of lo-fi provocation that didnt do Baldi many favors.\nAnd then \"No Future/No Past\" arrived as the first single from Attack on Memory. It was brightly produced but tonally dark with a queasy anti-melody-- a confrontational act that suggested that Baldi was going off script. Turns out \"No Future/No Past\" is the least representative track on Attack on Memory, but it opens the album with a necessary slate-clearing. While a full record of fizzy pop-punk wouldve been welcome, Cloud Nothings are trying for more. As an accidental concept album affirming the enduring power and purity of early emo (as defined by Dischord, Deep Elm, and especially Jade Tree), Attack on Memory feels above all necessary, a corrective for indie rock making allowances for everything except music that actually rocks.\nThe overhaul is radical: Its literally a different band from the one that made Cloud Nothings. For one thing, Cloud Nothings is actually a band now rather than Baldis solo project, retaining the lineup that toured with Fucked Up and likely learned a lot from them. While the freedom and ease of being a bedroom artist has its advantages, you cant make your own Sunny Day Real Estate and Wipers records without a beastly rhythm section. Even beyond the short window of time that passed between Cloud Nothings and Attack on Memory, this is a record that crackles with \"lets get this on tape now\" immediacy-- eight tracks, about half an hour, blunt lyrics, big choruses, lots of screaming. Fussing over these songs wouldve sapped their urgency.\n\"No Future/No Past\" is the first gauntlet Baldi throws down but its not the most daunting. At more than nine minutes, \"Wasted Days\" is far longer than anything on Cloud Nothings. As a radio edit, it could be something like Cloud Nothings answer to Foo Fighters \"Everlong\", a fanged beauty of barbed chords, torrential drum rolls, and impassioned emoting. But as it rolls on, \"Wasted Days\" becomes simultaneously forbidding, disorienting, and psychedelic, something like a black-and-grey kaleidoscope. As the band hurtles to the finish, Baldi repeatedly yells, \"I thought! I would! Be more! Than this!\" in a high-voltage scree as a painful paradox after such an ambitious display of more.\nBaldi has always been a hooks guy, and Attack is every bit as catchy as the more rigid and user-friendly Cloud Nothings, and the spaciousness of Steve Albinis recording gives plenty of room for these hooks to careen into each other: \"Stay Useless\" is an anthemic tantrum that shifts rhythm without warning, the bludgeoning riffs of \"No Sentiment\" give way to the plaintive vocals and jittery snare runs on \"Our Plans\", while \"Cut You\" fades out the record on a gracefully arcing chant thats equally vengeful, self-loathing, and hopeful.\nTheres the temptation to give too much of the credit to Albini, whose open-door policy has attracted an endless number of cred-deficient bands.  Attack on Memory is unmistakably his work-- Baldis vocals are close-micd and raw, the drums are loud as hell, the guitars are economically panned and almost entirely free of effects processing, and theres actual space in between of all of them. But heres Baldi explaining Albinis role to Pitchforks Jenn Pelly: \"Steve Albini played Scrabble on Facebook almost the entire time [we were recording]. I dont even know if he remembers what our album sounds like.\" It was meant as a compliment, but the lesson is clear: A lot of producers would be better off stepping back and doing nothing. Attack on Memory isnt what typically gets classified as a \"headphones record,\" but thats the best way to first experience how alive it sounds, aggressively leaping out at you with real dynamics. Check the giddy explosions out of the pockets of silence punctuating \"Stay Useless\", the offbeat harmonies and rhythmic stumble that sound like happy accidents on \"Fall In\", or Baldis serrated bark shredding the uneasy full-band détente following the solo of \"No Sentiment\".\nThats where youll find Attack on Memorys key lyric, \"No nostalgia and no sentiment/ Were over it now and we were over it then,\" making the titles implications clear: If you enjoy this as a work of art, theres an invitation to adopt it as cultural critique. Baldi shares stages and a label with Toro Y Moi and joked about \"Forget You All the Time\" being \"our most chillwave song\" at a Los Angeles show, so the title is more of a call to be heard in the current climate rather than a total negation of it. But the last Fugazi album came out when Baldi was 10, and its easy to see \"memory\" as a stand-in for indies stylistic pervasiveness: de-emphasis of guitars and live performance, passivity over aggression, past over presence, singing like you dont care if you get understood or even heard. That just doesnt cut it for a lot of people his age who wonder if theyll ever witness \"The Argument\"s kind of life-affirming vitality firsthand.\nTheres a fundamental irony in how a record titled Attack on Memory is such a sonic throwback, while Baldis lyrics obsess over arrested development and missed opportunities. But like the best of indies recent guitar bands that dare to skew retro-- Yuck, the Men, WU LYF, to name a few-- Attack on Memory is too visceral to feel like escapism, too vital to feel like cheap revival. Not when this sounds death was the wrongful diagnosis of trendwatchers: Those of us who grew up on Drive Like Jehu, Braid, and Jawbreaker can listen to Attack on Memory and sense their artistic legacy is in good hands, but there will inevitably be teenagers for whom Attack on Memory stands to be that kind of record to call their own. And hopefully well all meet up in the mosh pit.",

        "article_text": "\nCMYK is only the third release from London electronic producer James Blake, who is only 21-- and the reason I keep saying \"only\" is because I get a little dumb thinking about how much ground hes covered in so few steps. His style is already recognizable: progressions of thick soul and jazz chords (a product of years of piano lessons), pitched-down and mangled vocals (often his own), and mid-tempo beats that balance synthesized sub-bass with handclaps, snaps, and other humanizing soundlets. But each of his releases-- last years \"Air \u0026 Lack Thereof\" / \"Sparing the Horses\" single, Februarys The Bells Sketch EP, and now, CMYK EP-- also sounds like its own project, filled with private rules and concepts. Hes writing his theme and his variations at the same time.\nBlake isnt peerless, exactly. Hes got collaborators and associates. (Untold and Mount Kimbie-- two artists hes done remixes for-- come to mind.) But Blakes peers are better known for the boundaries theyre breaking down than the ones theyre reinforcing, which is to say that Blake-- who appears to have a brain full of uncategorizable ideas-- is in a good position to do whatever tickles him. (The BBC DJ Gilles Peterson had him as a guest on his show last week, where he talked about his plans for a vocal-and-piano EP, and how hed just had his mind pried open by seeing Joanna Newsom live. From any other contemporary electronic producer, Id be surprised.)\nCMYK is built from samples primarily from 90s R\u0026B. Sometimes, theyre incredibly obvious-- obvious like \"I hope James Blake doesnt end up with legal fees\" obvious. Other times, he crushes them beyond recognition. (We know from a Rising interview last month that Brandy is on there somewhere, and R. Kelly, too.)\nThe title track draws on both Kelis \"Caught Out There\" and Aaliyahs \"Are You That Somebody\"-- songs that helped define the years they came out in by sounding two steps ahead of everything around them. This is canny for plenty of reasons, I think, but Ill be brief: Blake takes two R\u0026B archetypes-- the Spurned Woman and the Secret Lover-- and imagines them in a back and forth. Its modern homage to old ideas. But if you know the songs already, its also an exercise in warming up your cultural memory-- both tracks are over 10 years old but under 15, a kind of dead zone for nostalgia, not yet retro-ready but no longer current. Hes not reminding us of something weve forgotten or telling us about something we never knew about, hes reanimating songs that are probably just at the edge of peoples thoughts. (Its also a statement of allegiances: though Blake-- as Harmonimix-- has worked with Lil Waynes voice, he doesnt seem to be as interested in current American hip-hop and R\u0026B as much as he is in picking up where Timbaland and the Neptunes left off at the end of the 1990s.)\nBut what makes the track isnt its samples, its the way Blake integrates them. Everything on CMYK is remarkably balanced: throwback sounds (a soul singer) next to contemporary ones (filtered synthesizer sweeps); deeply processed sounds (a vocoder) next to clean ones; moments of dissonance and digital noise next to a consonant progression of organ chords. One minute its naked, the next its obscure. Blakes songs-- three- and four-minute long pieces of electronic pop-- have no real space or time. Theyre not dance tracks. Theyre deeply retro and slightly futuristic-- which is to say theyre contemporary. Theyre made on a home computer, but sound like the work of an animatronic band.\nI keep thinking of the Wong Kar-wai movie 2046, ostensibly a love story with parallel narratives, one set in the 1950s, one set in 2046. The superficial surroundings of the past are different from the future, but at one point, two characters say the same exact thing: \"Leave with me.\" The context, though, is different, and changing the context changes the meaning. And when the meaning is changed, communication breaks down. In both cases, the characters are somehow misunderstood, and the misunderstanding leads to heartbreak. James Blake plays in these gaps-- these modern gaps-- in ways that are both clever and sympathetic. \"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\" is an old question. Blakes trying to figure out how convincingly they sing gospel.",

        "article_text": "Re-sleeve that album cover! Disregard those silly liner-note photographs! Never you mind the Decemberists attempts at theatricality-- Picaresque is the bands least stagy, most serious, and most accomplished effort yet. Its also as good a follow-up to Her Majesty the Decemberists any devoted fan could hope for. On that previous effort, head insurgent Colin Meloy proclaimed, \"I was meant for the stage,\" and indeed the songs sounded like production numbers performed by eager actors in a cramped playhouse. That album still retains its considerable charm, but the Decemberists sounded less like a band than a traveling troupe at the behest of fickle royalty.\nPicaresque easily dispels such limitations. Here, as he plaintively proclaims on \"The Engine Driver\", Meloy is \"a writer, a writer of fictions.\" As its title suggests, the album collects a compendiums worth of well-crafted story-songs, most of which sound more literary than theatrical (the nearly nine-minute \"Mariners Revenge Song\" excepted). In other words, the Decemberists are no longer the indie rock version of the Max Fischer Players; these songs are content to be songs, not one-acts, and the music is music, not sonic scenery. As a result, Picaresque sounds similar to Castaways and Cutouts and their live shows: The music is more dynamic and all the more evocative for not attempting to romantically conjure the past and filter it through Meloys imagination. Despite some historical backdrops, most of these narratives are set in the here and now, a milieu that suits the band very well.\nThe spring in the bands collective step here may be somewhat aided by Chris Wallas crisp production, but I imagine its mostly the achievement of the band itself, who sharpened their teeth on last years mini-LP The Tain and now tend to Meloys songs like bodyguards trotting alongside the presidential limousine. Chris Funk packs an arsenal of exotic instruments, brandishing his bouzouki, hurdy-gurdy, and dulcimer like firearms, and Rachel Blumberg, in her farewell performance (she has left to concentrate on her band Norfolk and Western) proves a capable foil for Meloy, her voice blending nicely with his on \"From My One True Love (Lost at Sea)\" and \"The Mariners Revenge Song\". She also adds thunderous momentum to the opening \"The Infanta\", a heartbreak pulse to the quieter parts of \"On the Bus Mall\", and an athletic shuffle to \"The Sporting Life\", and her hi-hat decorates \"We Both Go Down Together\" like jewels on a lovers necklace.\nIn developing into such a formidable flock, the Decemberists not only have far outstripped those ridiculous comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel that dogged Her Majesty, but have also allowed Meloy to widen his lyrical scope and hone his ambitious narratives. He remains enamored with tawny historical verisimilitudes, which inform the devastating \"Eli, the Barrow Boy\", \"The Infanta\", and \"The Mariners Revenge Song\" (the latter of which, legend has it, was recorded live around a single mic). But much of his chosen subject matter sounds startlingly contemporary, even if these songs still confront the familiar theme of impossible love.\nA cousin to Belle and Sebastians \"The Stars of Track \u0026 Field\", \"The Sporting Life\" views the roaring crowds, disapproving parents, unfaithful girlfriend, and disappointed coach from the vantage of an averse athlete lying injured on the field, and \"The Bagmans Gambit\" conjures a compromised U.S. government, a D.C. where everyone is for sale, as a backdrop for the story of a government official in love with a spy. Meloys acoustic guitar is delicate here, while the band churns a car-chase momentum climaxing in a nightmarish freakout that sounds like Manchurian Candidate dementia triggered by \"A Day in the Life\".\nPerhaps the best song hes written, \"On the Bus Mall\" is Meloys own private Idaho full of boy gigolos amok in the city, and he evocatively contrasts their innocent affection (\"Here in our hovel we fused like a family\") with the grittiness of their lives: \"You learned quick to make a fast buck/ In bathrooms and barrooms, on dumpsters and heirlooms/ We bit our tongues/ Sucked our lips into our lungs til we were falling/ Such was our calling.\"\nThe one standout, the apple among the oranges, is \"16 Military Wives\", which on first listen doesnt seem to fit the Picaresque aesthetic. Its not a story, but a protest song that uses a slick horn line and Meloys loosest vocals yet (I distinctly hear a \"whoo!\") to tally the mathematics of war-- plus dollars, minus lives. But its the sequencing that allows Meloy to work this aside into the albums larger mission: Following \"To My Own True Love (Lost at Sea)\", about futilely awaiting a lovers return, it becomes clear that the narrator could be one of the \"five military wives\" left widowed by \"14 cannibal kings\" while \"15 pristine moderate liberal minds\" look on helplessly. This is a new side of the Decemberists: angry, impassioned, and more in touch with the world than ever.\n ",

        "article_text": "Arular was first expected to be released in late 2004, but instead M.I.A. gave half of its vocals away to Diplos Piracy Funds Backlash mixtape, which married her London Sri Lankan patois to music from New York, Rio, and Kingston. The mix highlighted her big-tent approach to global rhythms and Now Sounds, an M.O. that was cemented when she professed her love for hip-hop crew the Diplomats and raps spiritual cousins, grime, baile funk, dancehall, and reggaeton in The New York Times. Faster than you can say \"galang-alang-alang,\" M.I.A. became the one-woman embodiment of what to some is great about the contemporary pop music landscape. All thats left is for M.I.A. to draft Seba as producer and that voice that name-stamps dancehall tracks like a heavily drugged, vocoded Just Blaze as MC: \"M.I.A. on... Bionic Ras... Baile Funk... Forward Riddim...\"\nThis transglobal express isnt new, of course: Young Jamaicans have been combining the best of U.S. hip-hop and UK dance culture for years, American rap producers seem addicted to the sub-continent, grime is actually lobbing singles into the UK top 40, and Nigeria is threatening to become the new hip-hop hot spot. \"From ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard, taking it transglobal on the aboveground, because thats where the people are,\" Hyperdubs Sterling Clover said of this trend a few years ago. At the time he was talking about bhangra and the Indian influences on hip-hop, but he could just as easily have been talking about dancehall or grime or baile funk. And when it comes to M.I.A., you can practically talk about all of them at once.\nUnlike most musical tailors, neither she nor her mixtape partner Diplo is afraid to let the seams show. Rather than hiding up the ass of cratedigging culture, they relish sharing the spotlight with and revealing their sources, with M.I.A. dropping names in NYC broadsheets and Diplo opening two-way routes between Philly and the favelas rather than stashing all the best dubplates for himself. Northern Soul is probably turning over in its grave.\nIf the two are interested in creating a dialogue between different artists and sounds, theyre also more than happy to allow listeners to eavesdrop, whether theyre improvising (Piracy) or well-rehearsed (Arular, Favela on Blast). M.I.A.s freedom-through-homelessness is shared by other artists (most notably dj/Rupture) but not by many of the source sounds found on her records, most of which are fiercely regional. Where Ruptures name suggests a destruction of the borders between scenes, cultures, and nations, his methods-- which include healthy doses of splatter beats and breakcore-- can also seem violently deconstructionist. M.I.As moniker, on the other hand, appropriately suggests rootlessness. Shes not exploring subcultures so much as visiting them, grabbing souvenirs and laying them out on acetate: The favela trumpet on \"Bucky Done Gone\", the London slang of \"Galang\", the disco sample on \"Sunshowers\", the steel drums of \"Bingo\", the electro-fueled vocal edits of \"Hombre\".\nM.I.A.s detractors claim her flirtations with terrorism and revolutionary politics reveal the biggest case of sufferers envy since Joe Strummer but little depth of thought. But if the latter is true, so what? An in-depth examination of demonizing The Other, the relationship between the West and developing nations, or the need to empathize with ones enemies would likely make for a pretty crappy pop song. An argument can and has been made that her political lip service is unique enough to get those topics onto your tongue or into your brain, prodding listeners to at least examine them. Some might find that off-putting, but pop music that reflects uncomfortable realities and is packaged in this sonic collage beats the hell out of 1980s left-wing hand wringing from Bragg or Bono or Biafra.\nAnd when it comes down to it, that \"sonic collage\" is still whats important here. With all the column inches and message board posts arguing about whether M.I.A. is an opportunist or a clever contextualist, genuine or a fraud, full of good intentions or no specific intentions at all, the closest thing to a truism about Arular is that its a taut, invigorating distillation of the worlds most thrilling music; a celebration of contradictions and aural globalization that recasts the tag \"world music\" as the ultimate in communicative pop rather than a symbol of condescending piety.",

        "article_text": "Edan is quite the character: With him, its either \"Sing it, shitface\" or an exercise in hip-hop erudition, as heard on his Fast Rap mixtape. Which is why one never knows what to expect from his recorded output. His debut LP, Primitive Plus, mixed the retarded with the ingenious; it was an entertaining album in a backpacker era that was more often redundant than refreshing. So, when photos of the newly hirsute Edan emerged and rumors of a \"rock\" record made the rounds, it became easy to imagine a Derek/Biggie Smalls concept album replete with irony and wankery. This record is no joke. Having established himself as a ruthless wit and tireless scholar of rap, Edan makes the leap to \"serious artist\" on Beauty and the Beat, exhibiting an auteurism that places him level with his predecessors instead of prostrate before them.\nOn lead single \"I See Colours\", Edan declares, \"Prince Paul already used this loop/ But Ima keep it movin/ And put you up on the scoop.\" The lyric is a synopsis of Edans new outlook. Yes, its been done before, but not like this. The song is his epiphany over a 60s jangle and mushrooming Moog effects. Like a master mathematician who suddenly sees the pattern in the formula, Edan commences his solution.\nOne more time before he blows your mind, Edan pays respects to the \"true scientists\". \"Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme\" is a timeline of the forgotten founders. True, many of the names he drops are familiar, but-- as many of the mentioned could tell you-- respect is the only restitution to them. Over a runaway break, Edan pays dues to the Fatback Band on up, providing a syllabus for future pupils.\nThe nightmarish diptych of \"Murder Mystery\" and \"Torture Chamber\"-- the latter featuring Percee Ps lyrical conveyor belt over the churning bass-line from Pink Floyds \"On the Run\"-- bleeds into \"Making Planets\", an organ dirge backing Edans laidback braggadocio that changes gears into a Crazy Horse-ish Mr. Lif conspiracy theory. Each song transitions to the next through the ever-present Moog noodlings and shared elements, an effort at a hip-hop long-player and not simply a collection of singles.\n\"Rock and Roll\" applies Black Sabbath, Velvet Underground, and Talking Heads to create a psychedelic ode to its titular genre, and \"Science of the Two\" is a tangled mass of Edan and Insight that rivals Run-DMC for seamless vocal interplay.\nOn the latter half of the album, \"Beauty\", \"Smile\", and \"Promised Land\" are three sample-packed masterpieces that compress the time between 68 and 88. Reversed drum loops, found sounds, droning feedback, Echoplexed vocals, syrupy strings, and truckloads of bubbling Moog intermingle with Edans Kane-with-a-cold mic skills to astonishing effect.\nThe gravity of Edans lyrics and voice on Beauty and the Beat is perhaps its most surprising element. Hes gone from a brainiac prankster to the Borges of rap. Even his battle rhymes have a surrealist bent. He doesnt wear watches by Jacob. He \"wears the Time Meridian as a wristband.\" He doesnt grace stages. He \"does the show on a fireball.\" He doesnt wear his own clothing line. He \"put a nameplate on a asteroid belt.\"\nEdan satirizes the narcissism of hip-hop by being so out-there narcissistic that someone would basically have to say, \"Im the best MC times infinity\" to compete. But its more than just his otherworldly assertions. Nearly every bar is a saturated image of his subconscious put on display to ponder its meaning. Some of it may just be nonsense but most if it is resonant. His lyrical inventiveness and idiosyncratic metaphors place him in a category populated by few.\nEdan is hip-hop, without a doubt. But hes the hip-hop that appeared in the suburbs in the late-80s and shared time with metal and indie rock, when MTVs weekend line-up was \"Yo!MTVRaps\", \"120 Minutes\", and \"Headbangers Ball\", with Public Enemy likely to find time on all three. Beauty and the Beat sounds like a record made by someone who once devoured the catalog and history of his favorite artists, traced their lineage as far back as he could, and has discovered his place in the genealogy. With that enlightenment, Edan is no longer an impersonation of his idols, but one of their peers.\n ",

        "article_text": "Childrens innocence is magical not because of what they dont know-- sex, violence, mortality, Ashton Kutcher-- but how they perceive what they do know. In a childs mind, grown-ups are distinguished by their calves, raindrops on car windows can become aliens racing through space, and long backseat rides furnished with action figures set the stage for Lord of the Rings-scale epics. By now its axiomatic that most popular entertainment misses childhoods true majesty, but every once in a while a Peanuts or Calvin \u0026 Hobbes hits upon just the right mixture of confusion and imagination.\nThe Best Party Ever, which compiles the first three singles plus five new tracks from UK-based The Boy Least Likely To, shares that youthful, existential whimsy. This isnt childrens music, but it takes a child-like eye to Postcard bedsit pop awash in 1960s California sunshine with hints of country and soul. Recorders, twinkling synths, handclaps, banjos, and glockenspiel accompany the requisitely shambling acoustic guitar on songs about tigers, monsters, growing up, and \"Warm Panda Cola.\" The Best Party Ever is a thing of wonder, made out of rubber and springs-- heartache with a sense of humor.\nThe band name (a regendered Morrissey song title) and the album moniker both cry \"twee,\" and theres no denying The Boy Least Likely Tos recurring fuzzy wuzzyness. But solid songwriting sets the duo of Pete and singer/lyricist Jof apart from the anonymous Belle and Sebastian novitiates responsible for stigmatizing indie pop in some hipper-than-thou circles. Opener \"Be Gentle With Me\" could be about new love or a budding playground friendship, and it contains multitudes of appealing elements, from its opening starward gaze to a stomping country-disco beat to bizarre non sequiturs like \"I want to pick peaches off a cherry tree.\" Winning melodies and the albums likable if neurotic raconteur-- \"Scared of spiders/ Scared of flying\"-- give the quirky arrangements an emotional payoff.\nBesides, for all its playfulness The Best Party Ever isnt quite the doe-eyed \"Hakuna Matata\" some early reviews have suggested. Jofs narrator is child-like, but its just a case of arrested development-- a young man confronting early adulthood in this chaotic century, not with the stoned quotidian of the Streets or the post-apocalyptic communalism of the Arcade Fire, but through a regression into childhood. Thus spooky-synth jam \"Monsters\" sees friends and loved ones terrifying the narrator by \"getting married, having babies\"-- and suggesting hed be happier if he did, too. The gleefully paranoid \"I See Spiders When I Close My Eyes\" briefly reveals the anxiety beneath its stiff-lipped cheer: \"How did I get to be a mess so soon in my life?\" Aching standout \"The Battle of the Boy Least Likely To\" features a prominent, \"Sloop John B\"-like recorder with quavering vocals about letting go; the effect is akin to a childs first encounter with death.\nYet above all, The Best Party Ever is as fun as pelting Susie Derkins with water balloons. \"Im Glad I Hitched My Apple Wagon to Your Star\" lives up to its lengthy title with the best-ever musical mention of antihistamines and the tale of an ill-fated Nashville excursion over \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" oompahs. \"We never did get famous, but it made us kinda happy and it kept me off of drugs!\" Jof explains. \"My Tiger My Heart\" recalls a Psapp album title for a ballad thats a bit like \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" meets Calvin \u0026 Hobbes or Winnie the Pooh, as Jof relates the difficulty of being \"friends with something that eats butterflies and pencil sharpenings.\"\nThe albums best song, the dreamy \"Paper Cuts\", channels Brian Wilson via Summerteeth-era Wilco through the lens of Aztec Camera. Its a broken-hearted ballad about helplessness against an ever-changing world, but it also points to the essential precariousness of what makes The Boy Least Likely To so appealing. \"If you throw a light on something magical it disappears,\" sings Jof. Lets hope not.\n ",

        "article_text": "Ive never understood the fascination with a cappella groups, and I doubt I ever will. To me, they represent one of the worst possible manifestations of unfettered personal expression, a noxiously cheeky release of pent-up inhibitions. I like to think my problem with these groups lies mainly with the material they perform, and isnt just some blind phobia or intrinsic prejudice, but until now, Ive never had any solid evidence to back me up. The Futureheads self-titled debut not only affirms my journalistic integrity, but justifies what is essentially a totally groundless position. While not a cappella, per se, The Futureheads are endowed with a gift for gilt vocal harmonies not far removed from that tradition, and theyve just made one of my favorite pop records this year.\nThe Futureheads arent looking to raze any musical foundations; theyve simply put their ample vocal talents in a novel context: Their record recalls nothing so much as The Whiffenpoofs and The Lemon Drops of this world, if greatly scuzzed-up and adorned by jangly guitars and ferocious drumwork. Like 70s post-punks Wire, The Futureheads show little regard for traditional verse/chorus/verse structure. Rather, they indulge in multi-section pieces that rapidly cover an immense amount of ground. The albums runtime speaks to how much they accomplish with this method: 14 tracks and a surplus of ideas in 33 fast minutes. Whats more, almost the entire first three-quarters of the album is single-ready material, including an actual foray into a cappella (\"Danger of the Water\") and the massively anthemic \"Carnival Kids\", one of the truly great songs Ive heard in some time.\nThe album opens with a stellar triptych of songs that recalls and even, arguably, surmounts the best work of 70s pop/punk icons The Jam and The As. But if tracks such as the blithely anthemic \"Robot\" and the unrepentantly chorus-milking \"A to B\" smack of bands 30 years bygone, The Futureheads manage to incorporate a series of startlingly fresh flourishes into their fast-paced pop: Leadoff track \"Le Garage\" temporarily rides on stuttering martial drumming before resuming its determined stomp; the background vocals alternate between vintage punk shouts and chorused reiterations of the lead vocal line; and a three-second breakdown between the verse and chorus loops an unintelligible distorted phrase like an extended rhythmic fill\nIndeed, the vocals are the uncontested centerpiece here, evoking a decidedly Anglo brattiness, but the bands angular guitar/drum interplay provides an equally impressive framework, summoning a Gang of Four more interested in delivering sparkling melody. (Coincidentally, the Fours Andy Gill produced five of the albums tracks.) Here, The Futureheads prove themselves as tight as Dischords finest post-punks, with the riffs and hooks necessary to flesh out their raw technical skill.\nMy complaints with this record are small ones, but nevertheless detract-- if just marginally-- from its overall success. The album is frontloaded to a degree, as is the apparent protocol in these days of quotidian rock parvenus. For all its shining moments, The Futureheads would have been doubly impressive had the band cut out filler like the admittedly naive \"Stupid and Shallow\" or the melodically lacking \"Trying Not to Think About It\". Even so, Im hard-pressed to think of many albums of this stripe from the past few years that arent similarly spotty, right down to potential classics like Is This It or Mclusky Do Dallas.\nThe Futureheads are at their weakest when they abandon vocal harmonies in favor of a more direct melodic approach; their greatest strength lies in their utilization of voice as a distinct melodic instrument in a loud, often strident context. Instead of affecting wanting vocals in a stylized atonal mishmash (as unskilled punk and pop/punk vocalists often resort to doing), The Futureheads rely on actual chops and the kind of melodic astuteness usually associated with piano-pop balladeers, and in doing so, they exhibit complete control over their music and intertwining vocal deliveries. Like a Greg Maddux of pop/punk, the band show an unassuming hand, but the erudite skill with which they deliver what may initially sound like run-of-the-mill concoctions is surprisingly potent and defiantly consistent.\n ",

Most of the clean garage revival was as predictable as a Guy Lombardo tribute, but the Furnaces stood apart, both for their The Band-meets-Syd Barrett nuggets and their lyrics, which read like a ransom note made from ripped-up atlases. Frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger sang \"I went to\" as often as James Brown goes \"unh,\" and her brother Matt coupled raucous guitar leads with a piano that rollicked like a fall down the stairs.\nYet nothing on Gallowsbirds Bark hints at the ambition of The Fiery Furnaces second album, the 76-minute Blueberry Boat. The 10-minute opener, \"Quay Cur\", sets the stage: After a two-minute overture with loud, blatting organs that pump like theyre driven by bellows, Eleanor is introduced in the character of a child who lost her protective locket, \"and now Ill never never, never feel like Im safe again,\" she says. The adventure starts: They cut to the next section, where the guitars come in on a deluge of nautical imagery-- and then the frenzy gives way to an acoustic interlude that finds Eleanor singing gently in... Inuit?\nThe Furnaces pull off other mini-operas on \"Blueberry Boat\"-- on which Eleanor faces off against a gang of pirates-- and \"Chris Michaels\", whose different parts run together so quickly that its story is almost mashed to gibberish. Matt Friedberger, who-- unlike on the bands first album-- wrote all of the material, emerges as a pop auteur. Matt has acknowledged the influence of The Whos rock suites, \"A Quick One, While Hes Away\" and \"Rael\", but instead of taking a single theme and expanding it into one lengthy song, Matt is more likely to concatenate half-dozen seemingly separate ideas in a way that makes every piece-- even a straightforward track such as \"Straight Street\"-- feel epic.\nSo much stuff is jammed into Blueberry Boat that youd think Freidberger put some of it in for kicks. The Noahs Ark of retro guitars and garish prog keyboards initially seems random, and on the evidence of the Furnaces live shows, these versions arent even definitive: Their sets rework, split and remake their repertoire into one breathless block of music, one on which a song might show up for only one verse or come back three or four times. But this isnt arbitrary: Matt and Eleanor are just reworking and sequencing the songs for different contexts. The process resembles the way a DJ sets up a mix, and-- like in a club setting-- the final product should be judged not simply on which pieces they use, but on how well those segments work as a whole and how the band controls the energy in the room.\nBlueberry Boats 13 tracks form a perfect flow, sticking short tunes between the mini-operas, building up through \"Chris Michaels\" to the brief respite of the \"Paw Paw Tree\" before exploding into \"I Lost My Dog\", the albums dizziest travelogue. As scrambled as Matts palette may sound, a close listen reveals how perfectly he evokes each songs content: The sighing tones near the start of \"Blueberry Boat\" sound like waves lapping the bow of their vessel, \"Mason City\"s beat chugs softly, like a train gliding into a station, and on \"I Lost My Dog\" Matt captures the frenzy of running all over town by switching instrumentation with every verse.\nThe lyrics keep pace, repeating the encyclopedic references and buckshot wordplay of the last album, but extending the narratives. Matt pulls us in and out of the fantasy-- as on \"Spaniolated\", where Eleanor starts as a grown-up slacker, only to find herself abducted before regressing back into childhood and given pills \"to keep from growing taller.\" Gallowsbirds Bark told similarly meticulous stories about Eleanors real-life wanderings through London or New Jersey, but this time the songs grow into elaborate fictions, and the stakes are higher, with battles and abductions belying the cheerful arrangements.\nThe Furnaces sound tighter here than on their debut, but they still retain a sense of carelessness and spontaneity-- listen to the rambunctious piano interlude on \"Blueberry Boat\" or the distracted spit off his guitar solos. Matt sings more on this record, with a delivery similar to Peter Gabriel in his Genesis days, and Eleanors melodic, speak-singy vocals show a wider range and more force. Eleanor pushes her crystal-clear enunciation with a more aggressive delivery, especially when she slips into character, such as when she stands up to a mob of pirates and swears, \"You aint never getting the cargo of my blueberry boat.\"\nJohn Darnielles Last Plane to Jakarta devastatingly parodied The Strokes approach to their second album, joking that they would use their money and clout to make a two-album monster with eight-minute jams, tuba solos and a Gregg Allman guest spot. Whether that sounds like a dream or a nightmare, the joke was on us: The Strokes second album sounded mostly like their first. But The Fiery Furnaces have made the kind of rock behemoth Darnielle described, a record for the overgrown part of our brain that craves engrossing complexity. The exuberant overload of Blueberry Boat will thrill and transport you with the ineluctable force of a great childrens story, one whose execution matches its imagination. And like all the best childrens stories, it takes off once the kids break the rules-- when theyre dragged away from safety but have enough curiosity and faith in themselves to enjoy the adventure. Were just lucky to trail behind and pick up their breadcrumbs.\n ",

        "article_text": "\n\nCass McCombs works quietly. Over the course of three full-lengths and five years, McCombs has quickly slipped in and out of scenes, skipping from one major American city to the next like he owed stacks of cash in every one. Hes played with folk, grafting bedroom pop flourishes to sonic skeletons just strong enough to support them. He swam through 1980s Brit jangle and deep chasms of reverb. No matter how much mileage he accrued, one constant held firm: His lyrical shell games often kept listeners at arms length, regardless of how well-crafted and inviting his melodies were. McCombs songs were addictively opaque-- easy to hear, tough to digest, and even more difficult to describe to your friends over beers.\nMcCombs slipperiness seemed as much like a rejection and re-routing of the traditional singer-songwriter tag as it did a refusal to meet a listener halfway, as though the dude were allergic to interpretation or the idea that someone, anyone, might want to peer inside his braincave. It all sounds like a carefully conceived blend between garden-variety male vulnerability issues and wild-eyed, guitar-toting-dude-who-fancies-himself-an-enigma bullshit. But on Catacombs, his fourth full-length and most stripped-down effort to date, the singer-songwriter steps out from behind the curtain thats cloaked his work in the past. And despite the sparser arrangements and increased focus on direct lyricism, its every bit as aurally hypnotic as his previous work. It seems like he realized there was someone he really did want to sing to.\nReportedly a tribute to his wife, these are songs for the heart more than the head. Opener \"Dreams Come True Girl\" is beautiful evidence of that. Its a straight-ahead chord progression thats just a minor chord kiss away from Bright Eyes \"First Day of My Life\" and Bob Dylans \"Dont Think Twice, Its Alright\". McCombs washes it in Pacific surf, lets it dry, and then flips it into a late-blossoming duet with actress Karen Black of Easy Rider and Nashville fame. A stunt cameo like that could easily fog up a recording, but Blacks turn and lower register compliments the feet-up vibe really well. \"You Saved My Life\" waltzes farther into territory, McCombs croon swaying along to a bass line that never ever loses its way. Hammocks of pedal steel, duvets of synth, steady breaths of acoustic guitar-- its a warm, understated arrangement that typifies music for sunlit rooms and Sunday mornings. Most impressively, there is not a trace of sap or slobber to be found anywhere.\n\"The Executioners Song\" takes the same approach to speech-song serenading and despite a defiantly mid-tempo pace that borders on drowsy, its heartbeat doesnt waver. \"Harmonia\" and \"Prima Donna\" are simple strummers that recall early-70s Dylan, the former an especially strong showcase for McCombs voice. Smooth as river stones and perfectly evocative when dipping into baritone raps or twirling in falsetto, its fit to carry songs so bare. \"Lionkiller Got Married\" traces narrative threads back to 2007s Dropping the Writ and signals a shift towards the outwardly old-timey and too well-defined-- a rickety template that only serves to box him in. In fact, the bounce of \"Jonesy Boy\" and Main Street shuffle of \"One Way to Go\" both run on and out of steam.\nIts good reason to come back to the beginning though, to the track whose directness stands tall above a set with inches to spare: \"Dreams Come True Girl\". Given a song like this (the chorus straight up kills me every time), and a staggering mind/skill set like McCombs, its remarkable that hes avoided being part of the greater discussion on great American songwriters. While Conor Obersts been saddled/showered with New Dylan hosannas and critical tongue baths this decade, McCombs has fashioned himself a groove as new school rambler and pokerfaced tone poet totally under the radar. Its a space he seems and sounds to have been most comfortable in. Until now.",

        "article_text": "Jona Bechtolt-- founding member of YACHT, former member of the Blow-- is a huge talent, something that may not have been readily apparent on any of his three previous LPs. Those albums, created largely as solo endeavors, will not have prepared listeners for See Mystery Lights. Now an official partnership between Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans, who performed on several songs on 2007s I Believe In You, Your Magic Is Real, YACHT finally feel like a full-fledged band with direction and vision, particularly given the added weight (or rather, levity) of Evans influence.\nThe songs on See Mystery Lights-- from the bouncy, burbling you-cant-take-it-with-you screed \"The Afterlife\" (which plays like a less spastic companion piece to the Mae Shis \"Run to Your Grave\") to the roller rink-ready vocoder vocals of \"Im In Love With a Ripper\"-- represent YACHT at their most poppy. Its a collection of stone jams that finds the band finally as hellbent on experimenting and expanding the boundaries of its sonic scope as it is on having fun. Built on electronic foundations-- laser effects, skittering computerized beats, and spacey synth lines (or guitar riffs that have been tuned or distorted to sound like synths)-- these new songs are giddy with creative freedom while remaining tethered in service of their melodies. The vocal melodies are bright and buoyant, but delivered (by either band member, or in unison) in a chanted, oftentimes detached monotone that plays up the repetitive lyrics mantra-like feel and adds a welcome undercurrent of slacker cool to their otherwise sugary optimism.\nSee Mystery Lights also marks the first time that YACHT are recording for DFA. Normally a label-change wouldnt be notable, as it is usually less an indicator of artistic choices than it is of financial or business ones, but moving to a label with such a distinctive aesthetic may be enough for many to reconsider their work. YACHT themselves created the track \"Summer Song\" as an homage to LCD Soundsystem, and LCD/DFA leader James Murphy liked it enough to release it on his label. Its no wonder that Murphy was smitten; the track, which also appears on the full-length, echoes the deadpan vocal delivery and burbling 80s krautrock synths of his own band, as well as cowbell-and-handclap percussion ripped from the Raptures \"House of Jealous Lovers\", one of DFAs biggest singles. Even other tracks on the collection-- ones that werent written specifically in homage to Murphy-- cant help but sound influenced by him. Case in point: \"We Have All Weve Ever Wanted\", with its minimalist dance beat, heavy bass, and Bechtolts dry, talky delivery, recalls \"Losing My Edge\", albeit with a lighthearted, anthemic chorus.\nStill, while YACHT clearly share influences with Murphys gang (Eno, Ferry, Neu!, ESG, etc.), their positive, futuristic jams actually sound most closely related to Tom Tom Club. Perhaps thats because, like Tom Tom Clubs first self-titled album, which was recorded in Barbados, See Mystery Lights was recorded in a sunny, faraway locale-- in this case, far from the bands native rainy Portland, Oregon, in Marfa, Texas. The vibe of the album is relaxed and sun-soaked-- especially \"Psychic City (Voodoo City)\", which features an elastic groove built on a dubby, reggae-ish keyboard melody inspired by the bassline of Althea and Donnas \"Uptown Top Ranking\".\nRegardless of influence or intent, however,  See Mystery Lights is a triumph. Its a feel-good album for an era that could use a little happiness, a sweaty collection of heady, hedonistic tunes just in time for the hottest days of the year. And the best part is that one spin of this wily, sunny disc will be able to transport you back to summer vacation any day of the year.",

        "article_text": "0101, 0103, 0107, 0108, 0113, and 0115. Since all jj choose to show of themselves is their music, video, and occasional blood-spattered merch, then those Sincerely Yours catalogue numbers represent the sum total of what we know about them. Hell, we wouldnt even know jj were a \"them\" had the groups Gothenburg, Sweden-based, Tough Alliance-owned label not confirmed that. So... theyre mysterious-- but not inscrutable: Despite a brief discography thats already geekily byzantine enough for anybody who ever bought into the legend of Factory Records, jjs full-length debut is as easy to enjoy as whatever the last CD was you brought home with a giant cannabis leaf on the cover. Theyre as naive as they are cynical-- or is it the other stupid way around?-- and they manage to be pretty, touching, funny, and motivating, in different ways, in all the right places, for nine songs lasting 28 minutes.\nYou dont need me to tell you for the 128th time (320th if youre at CD quality) how digital file distribution has spread sounds and ideas across the globe during the current decade, and jj have earned a place among the current wave of pop globalization, sharing both the island sounds and sticky-fingered irreverence of their labelmates the Tough Alliance, Air France, and the Honeydrips. Sure, jj still carry traces of iconic twee label Sarah Records, but they celebrate a broader definition of \"pop\". Sometimes, as on \"Lollipop\"-biting slo-mo raver \"Ecstasy\", jj do this by borrowing from global hip-hop culture. But they also participate. Never by straight-up rapping, but by expanding the reach of ambient music-- defined expansively, as Brian Eno once did, as music that \"suggests, a place, a landscape, a soundworld which you inhabit\"-- to include a whole new kind of swagger. \"Of course there is people out to get me,\" a female vocalist sings on \"My Hopes and Dreams\" as hand percussion evokes the Avalanches beach blowouts, hypnotic guitar recalls German Kosmiche Muzik, and gusts of winds whistle over high-noon Ennio Morricone strings.\nThen again, on the same song, jjs singer just wants \"someone to share my hopes and dreams with\"-- a humbler goal to be sure, but jj excel just as much at strummy intimacy as they do at lavish blissouts. The lo-fi hooks on \"Tell It to My Heart\"-biting closer \"Me \u0026 Dean\" suggests TTAs aching teen-pop cover \"Lucky\", only done as an original this time. The pisstake-y giggles also make you wonder if youre hearing their mixtape outro.\nWhen jj drift closer to early-1990s ambient-house, they still allow emotion to flood through the textures, and they never start repeating themselves. Opener \"Things Will Never Be the Same Again\" sets almost new-agey strings and Enya-esque sailing imagery to a bouncy Caribbean rhythm: \"I close my eyes and remember/ A place in the sun where we used to live.\" For all the flickering synths and rainforest percussion of \"Masterplan\", we also get Top Gun guitar rocketry, faux-innocent-as-Disney sing-song, and that reporter guy from YouTube going, \"Im dyin in this fucking country-ass fucked-up town.\" jj n° 2 may be easy on the ears, but it isnt wallpaper.\nAt their most ideal, ambient, hip-hop, punk, and the most crassly commercial pop all have in common an \"anything goes\" approach. Like any ideal, this usually gets fucked up pretty fast. \"New Age\" harnesses ambients chill-out pleasantness to eco-politics and yuppie mysticism; old rappers start dissing younger rappers for not following in their footsteps or being more socially conscious; the punk and indie traditions become as idol-worshiping as the classic-rockers they sought to displace. jj obliterate that bullshit and get back to a place where Lil Wayne can be ambient, and Enya can show up on an album with a pot leaf on the cover.\nFree mp3 \"From Africa to Málaga\", on some days my favorite track on the album, is almost as suited for a cruise-ship commercial as Iggy Pops \"Lust for Life\". But it also faces Important Ideas like death and art with the clear-eyed precocity of an adolescent, riding in on trade winds with a message that could speak to middle-school cheerleaders and middle-aged soccer moms and middlebrow-loathing former punks alike: \"The thought that you found/ Takes you to town/ Smashes your face/ Burns out your heart/ Then you go home and turn it into art.\" Pops just fine, too, thanks.",

        "article_text": "\"I used to be darker/ Then I got lighter/ Then I got dark again.\" With these three simple lines from \"Jim Cain\", the opening track of his lovelorn new album, the always-succinct Bill Callahan sums up his tempestuous musical trajectory. For those of you keeping score at home, \"darker\" seems to refer to most of his output as Smog, when his songwriting often succumbed to the weary dread his dead-planet of a voice exudes like gravity. The lightening occurred over the course of A River Aint Too Much to Love, his final record as Smog, and Woke on a Whaleheart, his first post-Smog effort. On these records, romantic gratitude gradually replaced romantic pessimism. Bill Callahan was happy; at peace. But it wasnt to last. The slumbering beast of love, \"the lion walking down city streets,\" awoke, and it was pissed. He got dark again.\n\"I started telling the story/ Without knowing the end.\" And hes still doing so. Over the past two decades, Callahans music has chronicled his unique, troubling insights about responsibility, faith, and love. The darkness that falls over Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle does not make it a Smog record-- it is an uncommonly gentle darkness that sounds light at first blush. Smogs malevolence seemed like a sweeping indictment of human nature, but here, Callahans lyrics feel intensely personal. The record, an evident break-up affair, has such a strong air of private conversation that listening to it feels like eavesdropping; the second-person pronouns sail right past us to strike the target of the absent beloved. The reverent intimacy can become almost uncomfortable, as Callahan proffers up his words in the same way the devout handle rosaries.\nLike Whaleheart, Eagle is kitted out with the instrumentation-- cellos and violins, French horns, pump organs, electric pianos-- that he embraced post-Smog. On Whaleheart, such embellishments were rangy and shambling; here theyre loosely clenched, as if Callahan built the music to hold him together. Eagle addresses a specific-sounding lost love, but more broadly, it does what every Callahan record does: It takes a long hard look at who he is and what he believes at this moment. As a result, it finds him questioning the truths he discovered on Whaleheart, as when, on \"Eid Ma Clack Shaw\", he dreams the perfect song and scribbles it down in the middle of the night, discovering in his notebook the next morning the nonsense words of the songs title.\nThis self-portrait is so complex and subtle that its tempting to skip discussing the actual music, which speaks so eloquently for itself. Some of the finest, most varied arrangements of Callahans career are here. Wafting strings and contrapuntal soprano vocals render \"Rococo Zephyr\" as buoyant and lilting as its namesake. On \"Eid Ma Clack Shaw\", silvery electric guitar moves up and down staccato piano. \"My Friend\" and \"All Thoughts are Prey to Some Beast\" are almost like folk-Krautrock, with interlocked motifs billowing out over rigid pulses. Best of all is how the clenched arrangements open out into flowing, tender catharsis, and these are the moments youll come to anticipate-- wait for the beatific chorus that bears Callahans dense voice improbably high above the sinuous strains of \"The Wind and the Dove\", or the effervescent strings casting periodic surges of light through \"Jim Cain\".\nLike the birds he loves so well, Callahans albums find him alighting momentarily on precarious perches and naming what he sees. By the time we hear the music, he seems to have flown on again. His vantage from Eagle is one of textured ambivalence; his images split and shimmer like double-exposures, immediately releasing an obvious meaning quickly followed by a subtler one that equivocates the first. Hes \"still as a river could be,\" and a \"child of linger on.\" He used to be \"sort of blind,\" but now he can \"sort of see.\" On \"Faith/Void\", he decides that its time to \"put God away,\" to no longer strive for his \"peace in the light.\" Twenty years in, and Bill Callahan appears to be tearing up everything hes believed and starting from scratch, armed with the terrifying wisdom of knowing that one knows nothing, and searching for meaning regardless. Hes resigned but heroically presses on. The void looms, but the music keeps it barely at bay.",

        "article_text": "That the Knifes 2006 breakthrough Silent Shout didnt set the dominoes on a series of similarly grotesque and unnatural sounding imitators is less an indictment on its impact than a comment on its inimitability. The current apex of ten years collaboration between siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer, its one of a handful of albums from the past decade that one might argue sounded like nothing before it. In the three years since, the Dreijers have treaded lightly, touring and remixing in carefully managed bursts before quietly receding back into silence altogether.\nWhen news of a Dreijer Andersson solo project called Fever Ray broke in October, one would have been forgiven for wondering if the duo hadnt secretly made good on their threats to call it quits. God knows, they still might. The point is, youll get no clues here: although every bit as alluring, this debut has as much in conflict as it has in common with Silent Shout. The sounds often square, but the ferociousness has been subsumed by a slow drip of anxiety and dread. The macabre nursery rhymes have given way to lyrics that imply a sort of domestic cabin fever. Its still of the same creator, just not from the same swamp.\nThings move slowly here; they slither instead of stomp. The house-inflected, booming low end of Silent Shout has been scrubbed away, leaving Karins voice naked and upfront, anchoring the songs in a way it hasnt previously been required to. Although no less inscrutable, her lyrics adjust. Where those on Silent Shout had a witchy scale and ambition appropriate to the hugeness of the songs, Fever Rays words feel so interior as to seem slightly unhinged. Indeed, one of Fever Rays most remarkable aspects comes from how Dreijer Andersson funnels little moments of humor, banality, remembrance, mania, and anxiety through her deadpan affect to create a central character worthy of any psychological horror. You might even reasonably suggest this record is about psychosis. \"Ive got a friend who Ive known since I was seven/ We used to talk on the phone/ If we have time/ If its the right time,\" she declares conspiratorially, amidst pattering drums and faintly tropical synths in \"Seven\". In the morose, slumbering \"Concrete Walls\", she slows her voice to a pained yawn, which repeats the final couplet to a resigned fade: \"I live between concrete walls/ In my arms she was so warm/ Oh how I try/ I leave the TV on/ And the radio.\"\nIn addition to many of the same plasticky percussions and goofy synth sounds that the Knife made their stock in trade, Fever Ray also brims with fragile, more finely articulated sounds, such as the delicate mallet instruments that punctuate \"Nows The Only Time I Know\", the bamboo flute that wanders through \"Keep the Streets Empty For Me\", and the grinding guitar sound in \"Im Not Done\". The album moves at roughly the same pace and with the same general tone, rendering some of the songs indistinguishable at first, but committed listens will reveal this to be as nuanced and as rich of a production as anything either Dreijer has done.\nThe highlights are many. Opener \"If I Had a Heart\" is a shivering, timely meditation on greed, immorality, and lust for power that dovetails nicely with AIG and Madoff (\"This will never end cause I want more/ More, give me more, give me more\"); \"Im Not Done\" is a pressurized squall that culminates with Karin dueting with a helium-voiced version of herself; while seven-minute closer \"Coconut\" rumbles on a pattern of synths and staccato drums before a ceremonious wall of voices arrive at the midpoint to march it to a close. Except, \"close\" implies it was written: the more time you spend with Fever Ray, the more you become convinced that these songs arent written so much as theyre temporarily let out. Theyre too starved, too eerie, and too transfigured to have been anything but.",

        "article_text": "Like many Woodsist Records alums-- the NYC-based label has also recently issued records by Vivian Girls, Wavves, Crystal Stilts, and Sic Alps-- Woods have spent much of their time together quickly earning respect and fans in underground rock circles. Unlike those previously mentioned groups, however, theyve done it by exploring a more pastoral and rustic vein of songcraft rather than loft-ready noise. On their three previous albums-- released in limited editions on a variety of formats across a choice selection of micro-labels-- Woods created a distinctive blend of spooky campfire folk, lo-fi rock, homemade tape collages, and other noisy interludes, all anchored by deceptively sturdy melodies.\nWoods latest album, Songs of Shame, is their most cohesive collection, and its not only quickly lifted them to front of the Woodsist crew but positioned them to be the group that appeals to those whove previously been uninterested in the 2008-09 crop of lo-fi. As with the best lo-fi albums, Songs of Shame performs some sleight-of-hand by sounding private and homespun yet also not just accessible but immediately lovable. Along the way, Woods can evoke any number of their lo-fi ancestors, from early Guided by Voices to the murkier depths of the Siltbreeze or Flying Nun back catalogs, but theyre still able to retain their own immediately recognizable off-kilter character.\nThe group is centered primarily on the duo of Jeremy Earl (proprietor of Fuck It Tapes) and Jarvis Taveniere (Meneguar, Wooden Wand) and theyve designed this record through an affinity for home recording and its attendant cassette culture. As befits an act with a somewhat befuddling discography, many of the recordings on Songs of Shame first appeared last fall on the tour cassette Some Shame. But even for the select few whove heard that release, these tracks have lost none of their charm. On the melodic \"Down This Road\" or \"Born to Lose\", Earls vocals have a strange, slightly unhinged pitch, sounding something like a muffled Neil Young. Drums clatter in the distance as though buried behind drywall, and G. Lucas Crane occasionally adds discreet tape effects to the din. Meanwhile, forceful guitar solos zoom unpredictably in and out of the frame, hazily recalling a time when it seemed every band boasted at least one avid J Mascis aficionado.\nOf course, it wouldnt be a Woods album without a few surprises. The most glaring example is the nine-minute guitar jam \"September With Pete\", which features a cameo from Magik Markers Pete Nolan. Although the piece is solid and less jarring than some of Woods past noise experiments, its position early on the LP somewhat dulls the albums momentum. Equally unexpected is another Some Shame holdover, a faithful cover of Graham Nashs \"Military Madness\", an earnest anti-war ditty that in Woods hands sounds like Nash and Young strumming away in the treehouse while Crosby and Stills are forced to wait out in the car.\nMirroring the wistful tone of \"Military Madness\", the album closes with an especially potent trio of songs: \"Rain On\", \"Gypsy Hand\", and \"Where and What Are You?\". The melancholic \"Rain On\" in particular is a near-perfect dusky gem, underlining the albums subtle themes of loss and disaffection. Despite Woods humble production values and their fondness for living room ambiance, Songs of Shame has that almost subliminal ability to make one want to move in to listen more closely. And once youve been drawn in for a good listen, it becomes difficult not to want to come back for many more.",

        "article_text": "On the title track of Camera Obscuras fourth album, My Maudlin Career, Tracyanne Campbell sings, \"This maudlin career has come to an end/ I dont want to be sad again.\" As usual, shes being sincerely ironic. Camera Obscura fans will be pleased to know that shes still turning out maudlin torch songs with apparent ease. It is a record of the most immoderate sentiment: Thirty seconds in, on \"French Navy\", youve already got a dusty library, a French sailor, and the moon on the silvery lake. By the second track, \"The Sweetest Thing\", Campbells ready to trade her mother for a compliment from a certain someone. She might not want to be sad again, but judging from the kind of tangled romantic assignations she confesses to here? Album number five already lurks in the inevitable fallout.\nThe sonic similarities and early connections between Camera Obscura and fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian have already been flogged to death; whats less often mentioned is that theyre also growing up parallel. Both began as lo-fi indie-pop bands with heads full of classic pop radio. Over time, both shifted their emphasis toward crafting classic-sounding songs in various Western pop idioms while retaining traces of their button-badge origins. More timid incarnations of Camera Obscura dissolved their genre exercises into a sort of equalizing cuddliness; on My Maudlin Career, the bands confidence draws them into sharper relief. Youll hear traces of 1950s beach music on \"The Sweetest Thing\", country on \"Forest and Sands\", and bubbly orch-pop all over the place. The album feels as if it could have been released any time in the last 50-odd years, but the inspired arrangements-- and, of course, Campbells indelible voice-- make it sound fresh, too.\n\"Refinement\" is the watchword on My Maudlin Career, and there are two particular developments of note. One is the string arrangements, which are kinda out of control. They buffet the verses relentlessly, taking over entirely whenever the jubilation reaches such a feverish pitch that words can no longer express it-- check out the deliriously up-swirling end of \"Careless Love\". Its as if George Gershwin stormed the studio. A weaker band might have floundered under the weight, which brings us to the second notable development: Campbells singing retains its vulnerable-but-tough naiveté, but it sounds more assertive and agile, with increased swing and soul, than ever before. There are still melodies of heart-wrenching simplicity that stick in your head to an almost irritating degree (beware of the dangerously catchy \"James\"), balanced by songs with longer, more complex and limber melodic phrases. Its a singing style one wants to call \"mature.\"\nAnd maturity is a central concept to Camera Obscura-- Campbells found it in her singing, but in her lyrics, the search continues. The asymmetries in her personality give her songs their distinct character. She still has that bitingly sarcastic, even cynical side, which lends a flinty edge to the sentimentality. Even in an adoring ode to a sailor boyfriend, she takes a moment to derisively mention his \"dietary restrictions.\" And on the rollicking \"Swans\", you can practically hear her rolling her eyes when she sings, \"So you want to be a writer? Fantastic idea!\" Sarcasm seems to be a defense mechanism for Campbell, one thats necessary because of two very pronounced and conflicting personality traits. On one hand, shes a hopeless romantic. On the other, shes very cautious, and somewhat pessimistic. These contrary impulses create the tragically beautiful situations in her songs.\nThe fear of getting lost crops up frequently-- at least twice on this album. So does the fear of public opinion, which rears its head on \"French Navy\": \"Ill be criticized for lending out my art/ I was criticized for letting you break my heart.\" Campbell is striving for equilibrium in adult relationships but keeps falling back into teenage predicaments. Her meditations on maturity, responsibility, and healthy love give the record its darker, more serious overtones. On \"Away with Murder\", over sullen minor-key organs, she contemplates the point where support shades into enabling: \"How many times have you told me you want to die?\" The question of what we owe the people we love, and what we can reasonably expect from them in return, is the backdrop for all the romance and depression. People are always showing up at Campbells door when she doesnt want them to, or not showing up when she does. Being beholden in this way seems to frustrate and attract her in equal measure. Luckily for us, until this schism is resolved, her maudlin career should continue to play out apace.",

        "article_text": "Natasha Khan likes pretty things: fur, gold, melody, the moon, feathers, things that sparkle, chords that resolve. Since she began recording and performing as Bat For Lashes a few years back, the Brighton native has loosely assembled those things around her person like so many thrift store trinkets. Were it not for \"Whats a Girl to Do?\", the lone song from her otherwise-too-precious 2006 debut to suggest that she might have the chilly songwriting charisma to match her outward appearance, it could have been easy to write Khan off as nothing more than an over-reaching asthete.\nActually, to be honest, that temptation remains. Khans aesthetic is such a perfectly struck balancing act between earth mother hippie mystic and post-modern Gen Y art student (see: the cover for her latest single \"Daniel\", which depicts her on a beach, shivery and windswept, with a painting of The Karate Kids Daniel LaRusso adorning her entire naked back) that its difficult to forget about the sheer workaday craft that must go into constantly seeming so effortlessly, artfully rumpled. Nonetheless, as of Two Suns, her second full-length album, all of that takes a backseat. A significant step forward from her debut, Two Suns is home to some of the years most thrilling music so far.\nKhans real breakthrough might simply be her willingness to wear her influences more brazenly. One neednt have any more than a basic working knowledge of female innovators from the past few decades to be able to spot the ghosts lurking around this stage. The strident piano chords and lone snare of \"Traveling Woman\" echoes PJ Harveys desolate roadsongs, while \"Moon and Moon\"s delicate piano playing and cabinet-reverbed backing vocals evoke early Tori Amos. Elsewhere, with its pummeling rhythms, double-timed handclaps, glass harmonica trills and vocal histrionics, the moonstruck rave-up \"Two Planets\" owes its entire existence to Björk. But even in the moments where those influences risk running on the wrong side of overt, they never feel stolen or unearned. Just as Khan seems most comfortable when shes adorned in a patchwork of styles, eras, and ideologies, this record feels more satisfying and fully formed for its overt cutting and pasting of those different sensibilities.\nWhats more heartening, though, is that during Two Suns highlights, Khan has few peers. I could probably fill this entire space just writing about \"Glass\", the albums aggressively propulsive opener, and about how its strange mix of elements (chamber pop, prog metal, new age-- what?) magically coalesced into some entirely new genre that I wish existed and yet still cant quite wrap my brain around. Then theres the booming \"Sleep Alone\", which, with its rusty guitar licks, Knife-inspired synths, buzzing basslines and floorboard percussions, feels kind of like a sea shanty circa 2074. Or the aforementioned \"Daniel\", the albums first single, which marries brittle, 80s-influenced electro and an inspired viola arrangement with what has to be, hands down, one of the most insidious choruses of the year.\nFor all that, though, the albums most vindicating moment comes at the end. Clocking in at just under three minutes long, closer \"The Big Sleep\" consists of a swoonsome duet between Khan and a suitably broody Scott Walker. Accompanied by nothing more than a stormy piano coda, the pair dip and dive around each other, stringing out syllables, dancing around each others voices and generally soaking in the drama. Not only does Khan hold her own, there are moments when she holds his, too. That shes capable of doing so is evidence enough that we should be paying attention.",

        "article_text": "Heres a record by a hip-hop emcee who spends half the album hunched over a guitar, daring to slum it as a bedroom songwriter. As a member of Anticon-- the hip-hop collective that bleeds at will into other genres-- its no surprise for Why? (born Jonathan Wolf) to mix in live instruments or write straight-up songs; he already matched guitar with beats on Miss Ohios Nameless, and you could call his half of Split EP a kind of song cycle.\nAnd yet every time I throw on Oaklandazulasylum it still sounds like the damnedest thing: surprising, confusing, and so wrong its right. Ever since Why?, Odd Nosdam and Doseone cut their cLOUDDEAD full-length-- still their biggest claim to fame outside the hip-hop world-- theyve been under the gun to cut records that are not only as fucked up as their breakthrough, but as fully-realized, albums where the artists drown you in their desparately individual voices, instead of just passing by in a flash of cleverness. For Why?, Oaklandazulasylum is the first disc since cLOUDDEAD that pulls it off.\nProducers Odd Nosdam and Jel make guest appearances, but for most of the disc its Why? who chops up song structure and shuffles arrangements from track to track, fine-tuning the music from every angle. And from the first song it sounds rich and original, with the guitar, simple percussion and blatting horns that start \"Ferris Wheel\" before it segues to beats and blippy electronics. Why? straddles both camps with total ease. The closest comparison I can make is to The Books Thought for Food and its similarly organic (and gorgeously captured) mix of sample-based and acoustic music. Plenty of songwriters back their strumming with drum machines, but Why?s not diddling with digital perfection: these are heavy, multi-layered beats, some lo-fi and crunchy and others high, bright and almost piercing.\nOn that note, there is a very slight downer, which is that Why?s vocals may be hard for some to take, a nasal drawl that hits somewhere between Soul Coughings M. Doughty and They Might Be Giants John Linnell. Im not a big fan of Doughty or Linnell myself; fortunately, Why?s tone isnt nearly as extreme (and certainly not as quirky) as either, and was never enough to distract me from his most impressive performances, or this records remarkable uniqueness.\nWhy? switches from rhythmic delivery to naked singing, sometimes on a dime. The slight nasal quality of his voice sounds so awkward that he cant help but play it up-- \"Dream on Costelyou\" sounds so unmelodic you cant even believe they let this guy sing-- but witness the brilliantly jerked-out delivery on \"Early Whitney\", where he treats the syllables like a set of steps to jog over. The almost grotesque, overdubbed harmonies at the end of \"Weak Moon\" sound so warped that they bend your eardrum, but theyre perfectly on pitch, and when he turns to a genuinely tuneful voice later on, it doesnt come as a total surprise.\nOn technical terms this may be Why?s best-realized recording, not to mention the most startling album Anticon has dropped this year. But the biggest surprise is how engaging it is-- and how much more you connect with Why? after hearing it. All of the cut-up collages and lo-fi tapes in his prior work were incredibly scattershot, full of distractions that kept his ideas from sticking around. I can think of more classic Why? lines than full Why? songs, let alone albums. But this record fleshes out the seemingly non-sequitor lyrics, and makes them resonate.\nIve ribbed the Anticon artists for their habitual memoir-writing, which, coupled with their surreal left turns can become a non-stop emotional reveal-and-feint. This time, instead of just dropping clever lines about his dad, he writes \"Afterschool America\", a song so tuneful and lyrically rich its difficult to imagine how he fit in everything in a minute and a half. Why?s geeky personality becomes human, and when he states, \"Im not myself without my Challenger commemorative button on my brown down vest,\" I can picture the dorky kid who would obsess about a piece of clothing-- hell, I was that dork, too. When he spits out lines like, \"Kissing me is a waste of your saliva,\" I can empathize with him for the first time ever.\nThe last few songs grow murky, and dont introduce much that we havent already heard, and the second side definitely lacks the locked-together flow of the first, but Oaklandazulasylum succeeds where it counts. Its as major a step as youd expect-- really, as youd demand-- from someone like Why?, not only for its sheer inventiveness, but the continuity that turns these lyrical snapshots into moving portraits, of urban neighborhoods, half-understood women, and most of all, Why? himself, as a kid, a misfit, and an artist.\n ",

        "article_text": "Where Were You in 77? was one of the first Sex Pistols bootlegs available in America. Released in 1985, it took its name from an implied accusation that dominated the post-punk landscape in the UK. Confronted with upstart poseurs in leather and Mohawks, all pumping their fists to the sub-par heavy metal of yob bands like The Exploited, the people who made punk happen saw their dreams debased by a mindless horde of aggro fashion victims. Aghast, they demanded credentials.\nThree decades later, chic New Yorkers might be asking, \"Where were you in 99?\" As Prince promised, there was much to celebrate in a year that saw a beat-driven sound coalesce around New York City. A handful of bands following in the true footsteps of punk rock re-imagined the studious, but fey, elitism of post-punk and the New Romantics, whod retreated from the increasingly insecure, violent world that became hardcore, taking their snottily smart fashion, drugs and dancing with them.\nBy 1999, underground acts had already figured out where to go once post-rock exhausted itself and nü-metal made screamo rage passé. DFA Records was about to take shape, and their soon-to-be first signatures, The Rapture, had just moved to New York; beneath their rough edges lay the echoes of a future funk that now sees them lauded as the second coming. From the ashes of a few west coast guitar bands rose Out Hud and !!!, who were dancing up storms in Sacramento, already releasing records on the prescient GSL imprint (these groups still share a few members, which can be expected as !!! incorporates eight musicians from the NoCal scene). When their 2000 tour blazed cross-country, chic newcomers rejoiced at the absurd obscurity of their name, eagerly informing their friends: \"Its pronounced Chik Chik Chik-- I know the singer.\" Occasionally, they were counter-cooled with, \"Well, I was at the Ballroom last week and I know for a fact theyre called Pow Pow Pow.\"\n!!!s self-titled CD [GSL; 2001] was the toast of the underground, \"A funky Stone Roses!\"; they were so well-regarded, in fact, that Pitchfork trashed them. It seems Insound.com may have been the website to listen to as the millenium turned: their precious in-house band Ida had already started covering Prince and the Bee Gees the year before. It was the only place you could buy !!!s record online (as well as that first Yeah Yeah Yeahs EP). People were loosening up; moping indie rock was boring them. Cut-loose new no-wave was on the rise.\nI saw !!! in Boston that year, though Im sure singer Nic Offers forgotten the lone, bespectacled idiot that danced with him during his obligatory crowd rush to oust the stiffs. I didnt do it to be cool, or to prove anything to myself or the audience: I did it to challenge his audacity. \"Okay, outrageous dance band, the New Bad Things tried this shit two years ago-- prove it to me.\"\nNic didnt flinch when I grabbed his hips and began dry-humping him. He was dead serious about shaking it in a room where few if any people knew who he was. From the stage, he did a great Ian Brown impression as !!!s division of drummers, guitarists and horn players jammed intently, the perfect balance between filthy hippies and detached session players. If it werent for Nics fantastic stage presence, theyd have been another boring funk band-- A Certain Ratio circa 1984-- but his gusto put the band squarely in the background, isolating them as a self-amused house band for what should have been an all-out dance party.\nWhich is the logical conclusion !!! are following on tour this year, openly calling their shows \"dance parties.\" But as much their music is driven by Chic disco beats, the melodies they lay on top are as dark as any in rocks past. Where New Order posited a gloomy pop synthesis of Italian disco and Kraftwerk, !!! drape funkier rhythms in a slate grey cloud, calling back to the jagged, distracted tempo-jams of New York legends Liquid Liquid and, more overtly, the Bush Tetras.\nIts track-stuffing that sets !!! apart from a growing legion of dogshit fashion victims like Dance Disaster Movement and Hint Hint. The sonic depth and compositional scope of \"Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard\" skirts tribute, unleashing dozens of ideas over ten straight minutes of collaborative invention. This is what club remix tracks always aspired to: a seemingly unending barrage of shifts in style and mood grounded by an unwavering rhythm section.\nAt first I expected Offer to quip, \"If you wanna be rich/ You got to be a bitch,\" paying homage to Laid Backs cheesy blue-disco track \"White Horse\", but its a misdirection, a two-minute intro of mounting cowbells and horns that blossom into ecstasy. The 16th-beat shuffle that dominates \"Giuliani\" arrives in a tidal wave of guitar and horns that give way to a gorgeous plate of trademark Martin Hannett reverb.\nWait, what the fuck-- did he just say \"the music takes over\"? Yeah. The one cautionary aspect of !!! is Nic Offers insipid lyrics, which, when reaching for anything more than meaningless posi-core chants, are largely a wasted effort (though Ill give him \"a message to you, Rudy\"). Its a much more powerful experience seeing eight people play this sort of thing in concert-- watching them shift gears-- than it is listening to what could be a carefully pruned studio outing. Offers jabs certainly come closer to the mark when hes shaking them in your face. Theres hope, though, in the \"doodoodoo doo doo dooooo\" last half of this opus, which you can dance to on wax (the final minute is a priceless clap-along tom march a la Toni Basils \"Mickey\").\nThe second ten-minute track on this EP is, unfortunately, a remix. While the \"Sunracapellectrohshit\" mix of \"Intensify\" (from their debut) is a commercial improvement over the distorted lo-fi original, it lacks all the discordant, dangerous melodies that made the song such a menacing live treat. In its place: flaccid Daft Punk loops and a spoken word approach revoltingly reminiscent of Fischerspooner. The stumbling hyperactivity of the originals \"Canyoufeelitintensify\" is gone, as is the maniac gospel breakdown that made the song truly amazing in concert. The glitch cuts and ProTools stuttering do nothing for me, though the insistent sample of \"Can you feel it-- intensify!\" as a Jane Fonda-cum-Nitzer Ebb base (join in the chant!) secures this relative disappointment a place on the dancefloor.\n!!! havent yet ascended to the ranks of a live-action M/A/R/R/S, but Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story) makes their intentions clear in comparison to their less frenetic, drawn-out tracks of old. Leading with a ten-minute single this outrageously creative, informed and exciting, !!! have a lot to prove on their coming full-length.\n ",

        "article_text": "Consider the defining conflict of our generation: flesh vs. hardware. Its been the central thematic tension of the 21st century thus far, and countless indie bands have exploited (some mercilessly) the discord generated by mixing organic and machine-made elements within their songs, building friction and malcontent through the juxtaposition. For a lot of bands, this means combining acoustic guitars, synthesizers and Brian Deck; for Grandaddy, man vs. machine is separate aesthetic principle entirely-- one that has far less to do with music than with the imminent fate of our universe.\nOn 2000s The Sophtware Slump, Grandaddy were radically pessimistic, a band droopingly resigned to humanitys relative uselessness in the face of gnashing, impeding technology; it was a stance that kicked open the gates for lots of OK Computer-aligning and gobs of millennial anxiety/robot nightmares. The idea of calculated perfection overtaking goofy human error is some awfully scary shit-- mostly because our potential futility is such a perfectly plausible concern. Consequently, The Sophtware Slump was a chillingly foreboding record, both intellectually and aurally frightening: it was peppered with moments of pure sonic brilliance (\"Hes Simple, Hes Dumb, Hes the Pilot\") but ultimately burdened by its own dark, apocryphal apprehensions.\nThree years later, Sumday glows. While it might feel oddly recognizable to some (please insert requisite Radiohead/Pavement/Sparklehorse reference here), Sumdays dim, protracted familiarity has far more to do with the bands sudden character shift than their occasionally questionable ingenuity. The déjà vu here is internal: Sumday sounds vaguely like Grandaddy.\nPastoral, sanguine, and oddly buoyant, the album is far less sinister (and certainly less adventurous) than Grandaddys former studio experiments, but still comes complete with its own curious set of demands: the first six songs are strikingly (and, presumably, deliberately) similar in timing, tone and strum. Luckily, the band avoids the sameness that often comes with such a consecutive string of spacious midtempo pop songs; instead, the effect is a dreamily cohesive half-hour of music, the perfect extended metaphor, a big warm blanket to curl up in and chew on.\nThematically, not too much has changed: Grandaddy seem to be actively pigeonholing themselves as a band preoccupied, at least lyrically, with the encroachment of mean, blank-faced technology. Sumday, fortunately, sees the band employing a more laughably absurdist bent (which, I suppose, could have arisen from the tragic-- or hilarious, or irrelevant-- irony that The Flaming Lips have actually already made a very similar record), tackling our collective defeat with a few more giggles and spits. Futuristic apparatus were once apocalyptic-- now theyre borderline silly. Computers and sprinkler systems are boldly personified as nervous and insecure rather than silently destructive. Desktops cry out bleeps of lonely despair when no ones around, robots are left in the dark, and, occasionally, vocalist Jason Lytle decides to embody the mechanized other.\nIn the tellingly titled \"Im on Standby\", a bot is banished to a shivery tech services lab, where he glumly laments his malfunctions: \"According to the work order you signed/ Ill be down for some time.\" Meanwhile, humans are reduced to fumbling idiots when denied the shiny trappings of industrialization. \"The Group Who Couldnt Say\" features a cast of improbable entrepreneurs who, when faced with a day in the countryside, slowly self-destruct (\"She kinda lost her shoes/ And lost her mind/ And smashed her phone upon a fallen pine\").\nLytles airy tenor is alarmingly tranquil, and its calmness can be oddly affecting: when he asks, blankly, \"Are you happy with what youre doing?\" in \"The Group Who Couldnt Say\" its almost impossible not to pause and reboot; simplistic sentiments aside, his always-honest, unwavering voice is resonant enough to inspire some serious self-assessment.\nWhen the project finally shifts out of its opening haze (exactly halfway through-- ah, vinyl!), Sumdays soundscape suddenly goes big, fuzzy, and dramatic. Things also get a bit more warm-blooded. \"Yeah Is What We Had\" is Sumdays triumphant (if unexpected) return to heart-pumping, fleshy reality, a distorted, spectral love song fat with shimmer and regret: when Lytle howls, \"In this life/ Will I ever see you again?\" its unbearably clear that the mans not addressing his iBook.\n\"OK with My Decay\" nails the most palpable of human sensations-- fear of mortality-- with frank, wistful piano, thick bass, and swelling synths. Here, Lytle goes sad-eyed: \"Im OK/ With my decay/ I have no choice.\" Ignore the obtuse lyrics and realize its hard to get more lifelike (or more heartbreakingly honest) than freaking out about your foreseeable demise.\nAfter enduring years of (yawn) useless Radiohead comparisons, Grandaddy have, ironically, created an album thats fundamentally antithetical to the record their contemporaries are scheduled to release on the same day-- rather than embracing experimentalism and cold calculation as substantive art, Grandaddy have gone soft in a way thats far more satisfying (and, to an extent, more compelling) than their detached past, where the band tended to miss more free throws than Tim Duncan. Theyve still got their clever title-spellings, and more than one set of lyrics featuring an operating system, but Sumday is all glorious, throbbing heart.",

        "article_text": "Sunset Rubdowns 2007 album, Random Spirit Lover, served up richly orchestrated, baroque suites-- each song awash with melody, counterpoint, and complex dynamic shifts. It was rewarding, but it was also cramped and fussy. And it was long, or at least it felt long. There was also leader Spencer Krugs cryptic wordplay and metaphors; he hinted at a narrative that the listener wasnt in on. Across his many projects (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Swan Lake), Krug often comes off as brooding, wise, and unknowable-- his music attracts because its difficult to decode his lyrics and untangle his melodies. However, on his latest Sunset Rubdown album, Dragonslayer, Krug gives us a fluent, easily likable version of his work.\nDragonslayer is a looser Sunset record-- easier to like, easier to understand. Tension used to come from stops and starts in the songs, but now the mood changes between tracks. Dragonslayer shifts from stately formality (\"Silver Moons\"), to heart-pounding new wave skitter (\"Idiot Heart\") and anxious, head-over-heels tumbles (\"Apollo and the Buffalo and Anna Anna Anna Oh!\"), but it generates continuity between songs. Dragonslayer still centers on piano and keyboard, with Krug picking out (instead of pounding out) the tunes. \"You Go on Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II)\" in particular boasts a beautifully clean melody. But this song-- like many Sunset Rubdown tracks-- gets more strident noisier as it moves. Its just that Dragonslayer moves forward with more finesse.\nKrugs lyrics feel, at first, as knotted and complex as ever. But now its easier to draw connections and dig around for meanings. Thematically, this album has a lot in common with Random Spirit Lover, as Krug continues to sketch half-told tales of lovers or friends caught in their own recklessness. His lyrics seem formal, but with a natural twist. Krug obsesses over the rare and ephemeral: black swans, virgins, or paper lace, which either burns, fades, or \"crumples into ugly shapes\" (\"Paper Lace\"). What seems like a pile of metaphors is just Krug simplifying the world. Actions are products of instinct or fate, always out of our control, easier to describe than understand. Its Krugs way of-- perhaps insufficiently-- interpreting the world without fully taming it.\nTake \"Paper Lace\". It first appeared in sparse, hollow form on Swan Lakes Enemy Mine earlier this year. \"Those were good ideas, but they werent diamonds and pearls,\" Krug sings while the drums laze to the ending. So his work wasnt done. Here he revamps it into a sinewy, shimmering form. Then theres \"Paper Lace\"s sly invitation: \"Come be a wild thing.\" Krug knows things will end (badly), and secretly hopes that it is so. Theres no doing laundry together, none of the city buses of Wolf Parades \"Grounds for Divorce\", no beer runs in Dragonslayers world. Its escapist fantasy fiction (though theres only one real dragon, right at the end).\nBut, thats the way were used to Sunset Rubdown sounding: fussy, untouchable, otherwordly. Lets not associate difficulty wih quality though. RSL had a greater chance for escape and awe; Dragonslayer was built for performance, and it sounds good live because the songs sound comfortable and straightforward. Sunset Rubdown are best when they are unfettered by those concerns, when they are fully soaked in their own set of thematic and sonic touchstones and could give a shit if theyre understood or not.",

        "article_text": "The xx are four 20-year-olds from South London who make predominantly slow, furtive pop music, mostly about sex. They are also one of the stranger recipients of UK hype in recent memory. They have no calling-card song; members of the Pitchfork staff have IDd no fewer than four songs (\"Basic Space\", \"Crystalised\", \"Islands\", \"Infinity\") as \"the one.\" They are not fashion plates, nor likely to be. Their list of influences is potent but imperfect: Young Marble Giants (too shaggy and heavy-lidded); Japan (too robust and theatric); Glass Candy (too quick and glammy). Without one gimmick song theyll never be able to reproduce, without an alternate agenda, without a set-in-stone hip influence, the xx start to sound like a real actual band, even if, after dozens of listens, its nearly incomprehensible to think that a group so fresh-faced produced xx.\nStrongly influenced by modern R\u0026B-- the group made hay with an early cover of Womack \u0026 Womacks \"Teardrops\", while UK copies of xx come packed with their version of Aaliyahs \"Hot Like Fire\"-- the xx use a drum machine to complement their copiously tidy compositions. Unlike contemporary R\u0026B fetishists Hot Chip or Discovery, who have clearly spent long hours internalizing Timbaland, the Neptunes, and other radio cognoscenti, the xx incorporate more abstract elements of the genre: a liberal use of bass tones and an unwavering focus on sex and interpersonal relationships.\nSinger-guitarist Romy Madley Croft in particular seems all but incapable of uttering a line that isnt a come-on, a post-coital musing, or a longing apology for a lack of one of the former. During \"Islands\" or \"Basic Space\", her voice takes on a pleasant soft-pop vibe, like Stevie Nicks. When Madley Croft sings, during \"Shelter\", \"Maybe I had said/ Something that was wrong/ Can I make it better/ With the lights turned on,\" its unclear whether lights-turned-on activity is sex or... something besides sex. Shes not some purring kitten, though, merely reflective about a subject we dont often associate with teenagers and self-awareness.\nCrofts sparring partner, bassist Oliver Sim, usually fills in the other spaces via either his responsive vocals or ever-present bass. (His best trick: momentarily interrupting the divine verses of \"Islands\" with four short thumbings). Sims voice, papery and affectless, is a sticking point for some, but pop music has plenty of room for ugly male voices, especially those with such pleasant friends. Importantly, both Croft and Sim seem like theyre singing not because they have the best voices but because they have the most to say (and, purely speculatively, possibly to one another), something that would align them with an indie rock tradition as long as the genre is old, (and folk and blues long before that).\nTheir voices provide plenty of friction, however, in the context of the xxs slight, expert compositions. Working without a live drummer, the xx manipulate airy, lingering negative space as well as any band going. Initially hospital-tile sterile, xx rewards volume and repetition like few other albums this year. Nudge the knob clockwise to hear sparse guitars decay, bass notes wobble. Amid these delicate environs, Croft and Sim can seem like theyre working on different agendas, but the cagey back-and-forth on \"Basic Space\" is exquisitely timed, and the lovers mumbles of \"Heart Skipped a Beat\", over a clacking drum machine, acquire their own weird logic. Jamie Smith (he of the \"Basic Space\" remix) and Baria Qureshi are responsible for most of the drums/loops/keyboards (and some of the guitars), and theyre adept at knowing when to jump in, picking up \"Stars\" just as Sim seems to get bored with it, spicing \"VCR\", the bands quaintest, simplest pop song (\"You/ You just know/ You just do\"), with small xylophone melodies.\nThat all said, the record is not a complete break with recent sounds: tune in during certain moments of \"Crystalised\", and youll hear the flecked, staccato guitars of Interpol. \"Infinity\"s slow-strummed electric chords feel like late-period Radiohead. But xx is nervy and self-contained, the product of a new band thinking a lot harder about topics-- sex, composition, volume-- than we are accustomed to new bands thinking. It is so fully formed and thoughtful that it feels like three or four lesser, noisier records should have preceded it. The xx didnt need a gestation period, though xx is nuanced, quiet, and surprising enough that you might.",

        "article_text": "The guy who recorded an album alone in the woods. This line might end up on Justin Vernons tombstone. Theres something irresistible about the thought of a bearded dude from small-town Wisconsin retreating, heartbroken, to a cabin to write some songs-- especially when the result is a record that sounds as hushed and introspective as Bon Ivers 2007 debut, For Emma, Forever Ago. These days, Vernon is more likely to poke fun at the image, but it endures because it fulfils a fantasy for us as listeners. Even if we dont care for the outdoors, most of us occasionally want to escape our lives, be alone with our thoughts, and see if we can tap into something true. In a time of easy distraction, the idea of heading into a cabin at the edge of the world to create is alluring. By tying the intimacy of that image to Justin Vernons music, were able to take the trip with him.\nSince that albums release, Vernons approach to writing and recording has changed. \"I dont find inspiration by just sitting down with a guitar anymore,\" he recently told Pitchfork. \"I wanted to build a sound from scratch and then use that sound to make the song.\" That difference is clear on Bon Iver. Instead of something that scans as \"folk,\" the music here is more like rustic chamber pop with an experimental edge that makes careful use of arrangement and dynamics. And rather than being tied together by a central theme of loss, Vernon has fully shifted into a more impressionistic mode; these songs are broader and more musically sophisticated than those on For Emma at every turn.\nBut the thread between this album and its comparatively skeletal predecessor is Vernons voice, an instrument that feels warm and personal and close regardless of setting. Now that weve heard him singing hooks with Kanye West and taking the lead with Gayngs on songs that touch on R\u0026B and soft rock, the general sphere of Vernons voice is clear. He simultaneously evokes the grain and expression of soul music along with the mythological echoes of folk. But more importantly, no one else sounds like him. The Beach Boys have been the primary touchstone for layered vocals in indie music for years, but Vernons timbre comes from somewhere else entirely. Where \"Beach Boys harmonies\" have a spiritual undercurrent that brings to mind a choirboys dream of perfection, Vernon sounds like a man who has outgrown such ideas. His voice is earthy and wounded and, despite his astonishing upper register, not something you would describe as \"angelic.\"\n\"Holocene\" contains one of this albums many virtuosic vocal performances. \"Part of me, apart from me,\" Vernon sings early on, and those six words hold a lot. The evocative nature of his diction is apparent even in a simple line like \"I was not magnificent.\" He sounds centered and clear while taking stock and allowing memories to be mixed in with the details of the present. His conflicted vocals trigger a half-dozen feelings all at once before releasing the tension with a refrain that finds the fleeting moment where the world seems right: \"I could see for miles, miles, miles.\"\nVernon posted Bon Ivers lyrics shortly after the album leaked last month, but theyre not easy to parse-- the storytelling here is oblique. But there are connections. The song titles reference actual places (\"Calgary\") and places that sound real, but arent (\"Hinnom, TX\", \"Michicant\"); theyre less about geography and more about putting a name to a state of mind that mixes clarity and surrealism. And the deeper you sink into these tracks, the harder it becomes to extract specifics. One recurring element is intoxication-- lines about being drunk or high that come with recounted details. Which makes sense, because the album deals with escape and the struggle to get outside yourself. The narrator takes in whats around him, mixing those thoughts with memories of where hes been. Sometimes the lines have a startling specificity (\"Third and Lake it burnt away, the hallway/ Was where we learned to celebrate,\" on \"Holocene\") and sometimes they contain words that seem to function more as sound (\"fide\" or \"fane\" on \"Perth\"). Throughout, theres a strong sense of an observer taking things in and processing confusing images, trying to figure out what can be learned.\nIf you caught Vernon live after For Emma, you gradually saw him putting more and more emphasis on his band, moving Bon Iver from that solitary project into something that felt more like the work of a group. And Bon Iver, with its rich and layered arrangements, extends that development in a striking direction thats both logical and surprising. Blending natural instrumentation supplied by recruited players-- such as string arranger Rob Moose (Antony and the Johnsons, the National, Arcade Fire) and a horn/woodwind section that includes versatile saxophonist Colin Stetson-- with an array of electronic and treated sounds, the album combines varied textures in ways that are ambitious and unusual but often subtle enough to miss on first glance.\nAt points, Bon Iver draws on the experiments of Volcano Choir, Vernons side project with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees (members from that group play on the album). Freed from conventional verse/chorus/bridge/chorus structure, the songs become more like tone poems, patient explorations of moods that proceed deliberately but unpredictably. The holistic style is evident on opener \"Perth\", which builds from total silence into a crashing peak over the course of four short minutes. And theres an uncanny moment on the breathtaking \"Michicant\", a song in part about childhood, where a bicycle bell rings twice, pulling you deeper into Vernons reverie. Its a simple, brief effect, but its indicative of how the album uses elemental sounds in unexpected ways.\nVernon has taken that voice, and these arrangements, and crafted an album that unfolds like a suite. The structure is flawless right up to its conclusion, \"Beth/Rest\", which has been much remarked upon for its unabashed and unironic embrace of 80s adult contemporary pop sounds. If youve spent any time in the vicinity of a radio tuned to light rock, you hear the keyboard tone that opens the song and you think Lionel Richie, Richard Marx, and \"No One Is to Blame\".\nIts almost naive of Vernon to think he could pull this off. Yet, heard in context, it stands as one the records bravest and most deftly executed moments-- not just because it lays bare Vernons stated admiration for artists like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby, but because its executed to perfection. And while the production attempts to wring something new from a long-maligned sound, the song and voice remain true to Bon Iver as an idea. As a closer, \"Beth/Rest\" is more about finding comfort and resolution after a musical experience that asked more questions than it answered. The song draws a line in the sand for anyone with a deep investment in cool, and Vernon stands behind it with confidence. His belief in himself and in the power of his music is something that encourages us to transcend labels and preconceptions.\nAfter the closeness and austerity of For Emma, Vernon has given us a knotty record that resists easy interpretation but is no less warm or welcoming. You can feel it even as you dont completely understand it-- a testament to its careful construction and Vernons belief in the power of music to convey deeper meaning. Its a rare thing for an album to have such a strong sense of what it wants to be. Bon Iver is about flow, from one scene and arrangement and song and memory and word into the next-- each distinct but connected-- all leading to \"Beth/Rest\". On the way there, the music moves like a river, every bend both unpredictable and inevitable as it carves sound and emotion out of silence.",

        "article_text": "Sam Beams first two full-lengths under the name Iron \u0026 Wine were bare-bones, hushed affairs full of rich imagery, whispery falsettos, rhythmic finger-picking, and not much else. In the time since, Beam has gradually moved in other directions, expanding his palette on both the excellent Woman King EP-- which featured more percussion and fleshed-out arrangements-- and 2005s full-band collaboration with Calexico, In the Reins.\nBeam has also toured with a group of musicians for some time now, so it makes sense that his new album would complete his gradual journey away from lo-fi home recordings. The album even teases you at its start-- it begins with a snatch of scratchy black-and-white guitar and percussion before jumping to Technicolor when the bass and drums dive in. The rest of opener \"Pagan Angel and a Borrowed Car\" is surprising as well, at once sleek and full of clattering Americana signifiers like steel guitar, acoustic slide guitar, and tack piano.\nDespite these new sounds, the core of Iron \u0026 Wine remains Beams voice, guitar, and songwriting, which is still more suggestive than concrete, and is built mostly around strophic verse/verse/verse forms rather than leaning on choruses. Beam and producer Brian Deck deftly build on that foundation, venturing into dub, blues, and West African music (among other styles), creating a series of interstitial passages that cushion the transitions between songs. Beam also experiments with his voice, layering himself heavily on several songs.\nPerhaps the most stunning arrangement is the West African juju casting of \"House by the Sea\", which builds from an abstract soundscape into a snaky groove led by a frenetic bass and a strangely employed baritone sax. Guitars dance atop the rhythm as Beam harmonizes with his sister Sarah on the chorus-- one of the few on the album. The albums foray into dub and reggae, \"Wolves (Song of the Shepherds Dog)\", could have been a disaster if it hadnt been done so subtly, with an ear toward the musical elements that define reggae rather than the sonic character that defines it-- its not a pastiche or a genre exercise in the least.\nFor an Iron \u0026 Wine album, The Shepherds Dog is so varied that it takes several listens for everything to fully sink in, but the individual details-- such as the dramatic steel guitar at the end of \"Love Song of the Buzzard\" or the cascade of banjo in the middle of \"Innocent Bones\"-- are nearly as rewarding as the overall sound of the album. The sequencing is also well-considered, setting contrasting songs against each other and ending on the stunning and starkly emotional \"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\". The vocal harmony as it rises into the chorus is shiver-inducing, and the song finally delivers the sense of resolution that much of the album purposely holds back.\nThe Shepherds Dog is Iron \u0026 Wines most diverse and progressive album yet, a deft transition to a very different sound that explores new territory while preserving the best aspects of Beams earlier recordings. Its the kind of record that just keeps pulling you back with its dreamlike flow and attention to detail: The first time I listened to it, I played it straight though again when it ended, and I cant think of a higher compliment than that.",

        "article_text": "In the seven years since Silent Shout, the Knifes mythology has grown to the point where the Swedish duo seem like something other than a band. \"Band” implies people banging on things widely agreed upon as instruments and making things that most people would recognize as \"music\"-- this feels like an inadequately pedestrian way to describe what Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer are. Perhaps even more so in their absence, the Knife have come to seem like a vibe, an ethic, a dark, not-entirely-scientifically-understood phenomena; other bands are to the Knife what matter is to anti-matter. When new artists say they’ve been influenced by the Knife-- and it’s a claim countless have made in the past few years-- they are at this point referencing not just a specific sound but an entire way of being in our information-glutted world: a desire to retain a tightly controlled, precisely evocative sense of mystery and mastery over their image. Even in the wake of such pollutants as international success, ubiquitous acclaim, and frequent imitation, the Knife have found a way to keep their name meaning something remarkably unique and pure.\nThis has something to do with the fact that Andersson and Dreijer have gone to great lengths to come off like they are something other than human. On stage, they were silhouettes glowing behind a translucent screen. They gave interviews and accepted awards in disguise (moving through a terrifying cycle of bird masks, Dystopian Blue Man Group masks, primate-inspired facepaint, and of course who could forget Anderssons infamous melting flesh mask?). And on the steely, electro-nightmare Silent Shout-- their first great record-- they found new ways to viscerally integrate these ideas into their sound, warping and pitch-shifting Andersson’s vocals until they grew androgynous and post-human. Somewhere in the past seven years, the Knife reached that Lynchian status where everything they do is their own, adjectivally specific kind of creepy. The early press photos for their new album, Shaking the Habitual, made an activity as innocent as swinging on playground swings feel forebodingly sinister.\nBut buying \"post-human\" mythology wholesale has always sold the Knife a little short. After all, what was their breakthrough hit \"Heartbeats\" if not a heavy-breathing declaration of vulnerability? Even Silent Shout cut through the abstraction and found a pulse-- whether it was the strobe-lit dancefloor rhythms of “We Share Our Mothers’ Health” and “Neverland” or the palpitating storytelling of a song like “Forest Families”. The driving force of their music is the interplay between the uncanny and the familiar, though in all the theatricality its easy to forget the latter. But the early information that trickled out about Shaking the Habitual served as a reminder. We’re so used to experiencing the Knife at a cool, veiled distance that the most shocking things about their return were the ones that seemed uncharacteristically personable: their faces (on full display in the anarchic video for “Full of Fire”), their fingernails, their smiles (were they actually smiling in that photo?). For all their sinister, shadowy abstraction, the Knife are at their most disarming and affecting when you’re briefly reminded-- and you often are, over the course of their sprawling, magnificent fourth album Shaking the Habitual-- that Andersson and Dreijer are human after all.\nBoundary-busting in content and in form, the 2xCD Shaking the Habitual challenges plenty of perceived notions-- about extreme wealth, the patriarchy, the monarchy, environmental degradation, decreasing attention spans (“Its nice to play with peoples time these days,” Andersson says in explanation of the records marathon length), and not the least of which the Knifes own identity as a band. The winding, unbridled song structures and industrial-tinged, organic sounds are such a departure from the rest of their output that they’ve said they initially considered releasing it under a different name. Shaking certainly pulls from a wider aesthetic palette than any of their previous records: found sound drones (they crafted the 19-minute “Old Dreams Waiting to Be Realized” from editing hours of electronic feedback theyd recorded in a boiler room), zithers, an instrument they apparently made out of “an old bedspring” and “a microphone”-- all employed in the name of breaking their own habits. “We went temporarily acoustic,” they declared in the madcap manifesto that served as Shakings press bio. “Electronic is just one place in the body.”\nIn plenty of ways, Shaking seems to have “inaccessible” etched into every fiber of its DNA. It is 98 minutes long (about double the length of the already-epic-seeming Silent Shout). Six of its thirteen songs exceed eight minutes. The official statements released with its music videos (“A Tooth For An Eye deconstructs images of maleness, power and leadership. Who are the people we trust as our leaders and why? What do we have to learn from those we consider inferior?”) read like museum placards. There are two long, dissonant drone pieces-- and one of them has the feel-good title “Fracking Fluid Injection”. But once you surrender to these facts and descend into Shaking the Habitual, its atmosphere is strangely, surprisingly inhabitable. Moving fluidly between potent bursts of electro-aggression (“A Tooth for an Eye”), seductively uncoiling, meditative grooves (“Raging Lung”) and ambient stretches, Shaking the Habitual-- like Swans’ recent and similarly mammoth The Seer-- doesn’t demand the same kind of attention the whole time. Many of the things that might seem off-putting in theory are what make it hang together so well as a front-to-back listen-- the drone pieces are sequenced such that they act as intermissions, though the kind where the air conditioners at an uncomfortable full blast and the house lights remain, evocatively, dark. Put it on in a room and it snakes in and out of your consciousness, but on some level it’ll still have you in its chilling, atmospheric vice grip. \nFollowing Andersson and Dreijer down such a labyrinthine rabbit hole would be difficult if they didn’t hook you from the start, but luckily the first three songs are among the most immediately arresting 25 minutes of music the Knife has ever made. “A Tooth for an Eye” almost feels like a belated, revisionist do-over of the band’s relatively unremarkable early work. While 2003s Deep Cuts sometimes struggled to find common ground between punk aggression and bright, calypso-tinged synths, “Tooth” ties these competing impulses together seamlessly as it also deftly weaves in a political message. The song’s refrain comes from the experimental British writer Jeanette Winterson’s book The Passion (the interstitials \"Oryx\" and \"Crake\" also reference a Margaret Atwood novel), but Andersson brings a physicality to her delivery that muscles the line right off the page: “I’m telling you stories,” she seethes, until you can almost see the vein bulging in her neck, “Trust meeeee.”\nThe polyrhythmic, polymorphously perverse industrial throb “Full of Fire” feeds off the heat kindled by the opening track and rides it for a magnificently maniacal nine minutes, while the creaking, evocative “A Cherry on Top” has got to be one most deliciously creepy Knife songs yet-- of course, that’s saying a lot. (At times it sounds like Animal Collectives “The Bees”, but makes that haunting track sound like a lullaby in comparison.) Built around the bone-curdling sound of a zither warping in and out of tune, Andersson sings of riches-- “Strawberry, melon, cherry on top…The Haga Castle evening cream”-- in a heavy, manipulated voice so overripe it basically wafts decay. Shes clearly having fun inhabiting the role of the fat-with-power monarch here, but her roleplaying is also an act of resistance (the band has recently cited as an influence the gender theorist Judith Butler, who pioneered the notion of thinking about gender as performance), of cutting the omnipotent down to size and suggesting that the institutions expiration date has passed. As the instrument warbles in and out of tune, the castle walls-- and the confines of pop structure as we know it-- seem to be crumbling at her and Dreijers feet. \nNothing else quite matches this opening run, but the second disc has its highlights: The frenetic, gargling instrumental “Networking” recalls the best of Dreijers techno work as Oni Ayhun and proves he can still scramble the conventions of electronic music with an effortlessness that puts him miles ahead of the Knifes many imitators. Then theres “Raging Lung”, a dank, serpentine 10-minute groove that lifts its refrain (\"what a difference a little difference would make\") from Fugazis classic 1990 debut Repeater. Tipping its hat to the ideologies of punk rock, gender outlaws, enviro-anarchists, and outsiders of any stripe, Shaking feels at time like a guided, international tour through the last quarter century of political resistance and radical thought-- or maybe an epic, authority-fucking mural painted in the part of town where all the squatters and crust punks have migrated. The most difficult part of making a record so ambitious and conceptual is, of course, bridging the gap between thinking and feeling-- a divide that even Shaking cannot always conquer. But all things considered, its remarkable how seldom the Knife actually sound like theyre guiding these songs with their brains rather than their hips or fists. Even at its most cerebreal, this record is palpably, poundingly alive.\nThough not as challenging as their collaborative opera score Tomorrow in a Year, Shaking still knowingly, brazenly risks turning less adventurous listeners off-- and maybe those who dismiss the record for not trying to recreate the populist magic of \"Heartbeats\" or \"We Share Our Mothers Health\" have a point. The Knife would clearly like to use their music to incite the listener to rethink concepts taken for granted and challenge authority, but would a more effective method of shaking the habitual be, say, smuggling a subversive message into the greatest (and at press time, only) four-minute dancefloor anthem ever written about fracking? Regardless of the answer, thats a question the Knife are no longer interested in exploring. \"The most commercial way would have been to stick with a formula,\" Andersson observed in a recent Pitchfork interview, but then dismissed that option entirely, saying she and her brother had now moved on to questioning conventions \"on a structural level rather than a psychological level.\" And in the end, though, Shakings unruly structure-- a perfect union of form and content-- feels like a noble choice. In interviews, theyve spoken about \"the importance of making your privileges transparent in order to say something political.\" And the great privilege of being the Knife in 2013 is having a platform-- theyve earned a devoted audience ready to approach their wildest, most challenging and passionate vision with eager ears and an open mind. \nShaking the Habitual is, inarguably, an achievement. It is the Knifes most political, ambitious, accomplished album, but in a strange way it also feels like its most personal: It provides a glimpse into the desires, intellectual enthusiasms and (unsurprisingly dense) reading list guiding one of musics most shadowy duos. At its most mesmerizing, its conceptual rigor and occasional inscrutability are overpowered by a disarming earnestness: It is a musical manifesto advocating for a better, fairer, weirder world. Shaking the Habitual feels not post-human but profoundly humanist, fueled by an unfashionable but profoundly refreshing faith in musics ability to hypnotize, to agitate, and to liberate-- to become, in Wintersons words, \"the high note that smashes the glass and spills the liquid.\"",

        "article_text": "The concept of samsara, one of the Buddhas four noble truths, holds that all beings are trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Fueled by internal struggle, we turn along an endless wheel of suffering, passing through untold lives in our never-ending quest for enlightenment. Some meditate upon this truth for years; Kurt Vile, on \"Lifes a Beach\", nailed it for us in two mumbled words: \"Lifes awhile.\"\nViles music has exuded this unique stoner-Yoda wisdom from the very beginning, even if you werent searching for it. His sound-- warm, unhurried, and spacious-- doesnt demand close focus, but one of the joys of being pulled into Viles lonely, contented universe is in discovering that he is muttering sharply self-aware things to himself.  It adds another layer to Viles appeal; seduced by the soothing, watery-blue glimmer of that sound, which promised to make you feel like the only human in the universe, you slowly realized theres actually one other guy here, and hes kind of a wiseass.\nWakin on a Pretty Daze is Viles most spacious, becalmed record yet, and it contains some of his best-ever brand of cosmic stand-up. It opens, literally, with a stretch and a yawn: On the (almost) title track \"Wakin on a Pretty Day\", a wahed guitar rubs the grit out of its eyes while Vile beholds his furiously ringing phone with clinical detachment: \"Phone ringing off the shelf/ I guess somebody has something they really wanna prove to us today,\" he notes. Unperturbed, he moves along, concerned with something far more pressing: \"I gotta figure out what kind of wisecrack Im gonna drop along the way -- today.\" The music quickens for a beat or two at this prospect, but settles back down. In Viles universe, there is time enough for everything.\nAccordingly, Wakin on a Pretty Daze moves at its own stately pace and with its own serene logic and time. Songs unfurl for six, or seven, or eight minutes without peaking dynamically or changing; the tangle of finger-picked guitars on \"Was All Talk\" queue up like synth presets that Vile just lets roll. On most songs, four or five chords cycle for minutes on end, echoing upward into the records warm room tone. \"Pure Pain\" shifts between stomping, hard acoustic chording and two wide-open billowing finger-picked chords that simply hang while Vile muses: \"Every time I look out my window/ All my emotions they are speeding/ Zip through the highways in my head.\"  It can be occasionally frustrating to interact with a piece of music so fundamentally unconcerned with interaction, but like anything worth truly loving, Wakin on a Pretty Daze opens up slowly. The music, and the act of loving it, are exercises in patience. Or, as Vile puts it sagely on \"Too Hard\": \"Take your time, so they say, and thats probably the best way to be.\"\nViles releases are small variations on each other, and discerning the differences between them comes down to intangibles, things that are difficult to point to: The fact that he only yelps his little \"Woo!\" twice on \"Shame Chamber\"  the first time around, for instance, indicating his bone-deep understanding that two \"woos,\" for now, are plenty. Or the way the silvery guitar leads snake through the album without ever assuming the foreground, murmuring things that reward attention in the same way Viles lyrics do. The way the drums nudge gently into the title refrain on \"Girl Called Alex\", and how Viles \"I wanna-\" is abruptly cut off by a stinging guitar; these details, small by themselves, offer accumulated testimony to Viles mastery of his world. Wakin on a Pretty Daze breezes past like a Klonopin dream, and radiates an easy confidence that is as rewarding to return to as a melody.\n\"Sometimes when I get in my zone, youd think I was stoned, but I never as they say touch that stuff, \" Vile sings, with a hint of mockery, on Wakins closer \"Goldtone.\" The song is stunning, a desert island of Kurt Viledom. Ever since Vile signed to Matador, his music has grown warmer and more expansive as he receded further into the privacy of his own mind: On Smoke Ring for My Halos \"Ghost Town,\" he crooned gently, \"I think Im never gonna leave my couch again/ Cuz when Im out, Im only in my mind.\" \"Goldtone,\" and all of Wakin on a Pretty Daze, feels like the culmination of Viles quest to get away from people, noises, civilization and find somewhere to sit and whistle his own tune. If Kurt Vile could paint a storybook Heaven, it would look like \"Goldtone\", and he signs it with his most poetic, self-aware koan ever:  \"I might be adrift but Im still alert/ Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone.\" A guitar pushes a wispy cirrus cloud across the sky, sea-blue chimes glitter, and Vile mumbles his way into the sunset. ",

        "article_text": "At one point in the schlocky 1975 musical comedy Lisztomania, Roger Daltrey whips out an absurdly large phallus and no less than five women simultaneously straddle it like a cannon. Its as insane as it sounds. In the movie, Daltrey plays Franz Liszt, the 19th century Hungarian pianist and composer known for his flamboyant playing style-- hysterical women fought over his handkerchiefs at concerts more than a century before the Beatles. Whereas Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts music represented all things respectable and classicist, Liszt was a Romantic hero full of flash; Amadeus won eight Oscars, Lisztomania boasts lines like, \"Your big ambition was to stick your working-class cock up a piece of high-class crumpet.\" With their fourth album, Phoenix reference both composers and hone in on an elusive target somewhere between Mozarts formal wonders and Listzs dramatic flair. While the albums 10 songs are arranged and executed with virtuoso pop-rock precision, they chronicle nothing but angst, confusion, disappointment, and despair. Its truly universal-- everybody live, love, and die.\nMuch of the albums internal conflict is laid out in its first couple lines. \"So sentimental; not sentimental, no!/ Romantic; not disgusting yet,\" sings frontman Thomas Mars on opener \"Lisztomania\", sounding like a madman with two tiny creatures whispering into each ear. Mars keeps this treacherous divide in mind throughout Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and the rest of the record successfully avoids mush while keeping its beating heart intact. And the issue of thematic directness is especially important to Phoenix-- this is an established indie band writing songs about love that are armed with hooks primed for a mainstream embrace. Just listen to the invincible crescendo of Wolfgangs \"Countdown\"-- especially that little Coldplay-esque piano twinkle about three and a half minutes in-- and realize that these guys are a few Chris Martin-isms away from staggering ubiquity. Theyre a bona fide \"should be bigger\" band.\nBut, as their songs tighten into increasingly effective bursts of pop, Mars is breaking up his words and meanings into smaller and smaller fragments. His isnt a self-congratulatory, indie-nerd triumph, though, i.e., Mars isnt being cryptic to be an asshole. Hes getting better and more sophisticated as his band discards anything-- an outro, a bridge, an extra hi-hat hit-- that could be deemed superfluous. Sure: YouTube tells us this album will make a generation-spanning touchstone like The Breakfast Club that much better. Itll also hit your gut if you listen hard enough. There are layers here-- maybe too many layers for the biggest rooms.\n\"I feel too young,\" went the hook on Phoenixs innocent and bittersweet 2000 debut single. Back then, the quartet was following a wave of Gallic cool led by friends Daft Punk and Air. Nearly 10 years on and this casually chic group has grown into something unique-- Wolfgang isnt a tweaked Air record or a tweaked Strokes record as much as its a Phoenix record. Gone is the sometimes-flimsy blue-eyed soul of their first two LPs, replaced with a glossier take on the uptick guitars and sampled snare snaps of 2006s brilliant Its Never Been Like That. And theyre not feeling so young anymore, either. \"Do you remember when 21 years was old?\" muses Mars on \"Countdown\". Growing up, looking back, and peeking ahead usually isnt this enjoyable.\nIts unflappable sonic sheen gives Wolfgang some winsome 80s nostalgia, but smart modern touches-- a constant near-Auto-Tune vocal effect, Justice-lite keyboard stabs on \"1901\"-- ensure its of-the-moment-ness. Meanwhile, Mars hints at a time and space where hes everywhere-- or nowhere-- all at once. \"Acres/ Visible horizon/ Right where it starts and ends/ When did we start the end?\" he wonders aloud at the end of the krautrocking epic \"Love Is a Sunset\", just after the song has blasted into a stratosphere where a diminishing horizon line is the only clear thing in sight. \"Rome\" likens a collapsing relationship to a collapsed empire; \"2000 years remain in a trash can.\" And, on \"Countdown\", Mars ennui reaches its peak as he sings, \"True and everlasting didnt last that long.\" But hes not sad-sacking along, head down, no umbrella. Hes pumped. Excited. With the band going full-bore behind him, he concludes the most ebullient song about existential inevitability in recent memory with an impassioned rallying cry: \"Were the lonesome! Were the lonesome!\" All together now.\nAt another point in Lisztomania, Roger Daltreys entire body is sucked into a devilish princess underthings. (Seriously.) Before that happens, though, the cigar-chomping heiress quotes Oscar Wilde while explaining her unladylike smoking habit, \"Its the perfect form of pleasure, its exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one ask?\" Phoenix seem to understand this line of thinking-- and not just because they look like a group of guys who know their Gauloises. Theyre pleasure-pushers, filling tunes with riffs, phrases, and beats a five-year-old could love. But, on Wolfgang, those same songs are unfulfilled-- and this band wouldnt have it any other way. Theres beauty in a sunset. Phoenix are wringing it out.",

        "article_text": "The A-Team. CHiPS. The Great American Hero. Hunter. Riptide. Magnum P.I. Hardcastle and McCormick. For an all-too-brief moment in the early 1980s, network television seemed to cater almost exclusively to boys aged 7-15. I was lucky to be a member of this elite class, amongst the target demo of these kid-tested/mother-denied telecasts. But for all the hours I spent admiring Lee Majors proto-MacGyver ingenuity and B.A. Baracus oppressive unsilliness, I have no distinct visual memories of these shows; just a vague montage of military-grade explosives, dirt mounds, and white limousines.\nThe only thing I remember with any clarity at all is the music-- those awesome, supercharged theme songs that outblasted any onscreen artillery and promised more stunt-powered glory than Evel Knievels Snake River Canyon jump. And most of them were written by one man: the cruelly unsung Mike Post, stateside televisions own Ennio Morricone. The breadth of Posts stylistic range and uncanny knack for visceral impact have made him one of very few television composers worth remembering, and I guarantee you know more of his work than you think.\nI cant pretend to know which brilliantly Post-themed programs were broadcast in the UK (although many were), but six-strong Brighton brigade The Go! Team are clearly just as familiar with his work as any American my age. Their debut album, Thunder, Lightning, Strike, is a hazy blend of nostalgia, evoking that period through a melange of action hero theme songs, early hip-hop (from 1979-82, in particular), and traces of 70s sunshine funk.\nIn a contemporary context, The Go! Team-- not to be confused with Calvin Johnsons highly inferior 1980s collective of the same name-- could be shelved alongside The Avalanches and Rjd2, as all three share a party aesthetic whose reflection of bygone eras is just slightly wistful. But one immediately striking difference between them is The Go! Teams reliance on live instrumentation. Though they certainly do their fair share of sampling, they tend to use fragments as a means of fleshing out the battling, overdriven guitars, triumphant trumpet lines, and drum assaults that seem to break through walls with the barreling force of a thousand Kool-Aid men.\nThunder, Lightning, Strikes opener, \"Panther Dash\", wastes no time establishing the bands modus operandi: Its \"Hawaii Five-O\" crash-in mates with an open-range harmonica to evoke some lost Sergio Leone-directed \"Speed Racer\" showdown. \"The Power Is On\" pops like puffy rainbow stickers, rubbing determined piano chords against surly trumpets and cheerleader chants. \"Junior Kickstart\" is BMX banditos navigating mud-caked spokes and handlebars through flagged-off terrain. \"Bottle Rocket\" throws back to Saturday morning cartoons and Brooklyn b-girl breakdowns, with female rapper Ninja lunging from dusk-cast shadows to conjure a katana-wielding Sha Rock.\nThis record recalls, with striking exactness, a very specific time and place that The Go! Team could only have experienced second-hand, through imported television and culture. But then, it was vicarious for us all: Thunder, Lightning, Strike aspires to recapture the imaginary good-natured competitiveness of a period before realism dominated prime-time TV, when cars and helicopters could talk, and good guys always wore pleather. Its all dusky reds and yellows, shag-headed battle royales, exploding tanks, and getting up the next day to relive it on the playground.",

        "article_text": "01 Intro [w. Ryan Schreiber] For Shawn Carter, the last seven years have been ridiculous. In 1996, he came up from an impoverished childhood in New Yorks Marcy projects to record a debut that would eventually come to be considered one of hip-hops landmark albums, and spent the succeeding six years dominating Billboard charts, filling the East Coast void left by Biggies death, and building a hip-hop empire to rival Puffys Bad Boy Entertainment. In that time, hes seen as many failures as successes-- critics panned him for selling out after the critical reverence of Reasonable Doubt, La Roc Familia was a disaster from any angle, and, by Jays standards, last years The Blueprint 2 couldnt even claim to be a commercial success. Still, hes come out on top time and again: Today, hes reclaimed the title as hip-hops reigning emcee, and his Rocafella record label, clothing line, and film company together are said to be valued at more than $4.4 billion.\nSo why would he want out now, at the peak of his popularity? The Black Album, touted as his final release, offers some answers, though none as clear-cut as what may or may not be the truth: that its all an elaborate publicity stunt. Or maybe its not: Jay has cut an album every year for the past seven years; that hed want a break of some sort now is understandable. Certain lyrics hint that this isnt the last record hell cut, but if thats true, will his game still be as tight when gets around to the comeback? Its anyones guess, and that mystery is part of what makes this album such an intriguing listen.\nThe prospect of hip-hops finest producers laying down tracks for the final LP from the rap worlds brightest talent has made The Black Album one of the most anticipated rap records of the decade. Whats stunning is that it delivers raps greatest career-ender since Outkasts Stankonia. Even in falling short of Jays classics, Reasonable Doubt and 2001s The Blueprint, it manages to eclipse 1999s brilliant Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter as his third-best album-- which in itself makes it one of the years best.\nIn light of the hype this records received for its choice of beatmakers, we egomaniacally matched the personalities of our staff writers to Jays producers. (However, we regret that we could not take the concept to its logical extreme and cease operations after publishing it.)\n02 December 4th [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton] In this game of stick-and-move with triumphantly spiraling Chi-Lites strings, Hovas mother Gloria narrates a dizzying tale of growth through adversity, unusual childhood circumstances, and the catalysts for our protagonists career. The victorious overtone gives Carter the opportunity to apply his unwavering flow and powerful control of conceptual direction to his own personal experiences: When he details that he \"had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\" and that \"this is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me,\" the emotional context of the lines quickly turns to dumbstruck awe. Regardless of the reasonably simple Blueprint-tempered backing and familiar topical terrain, \"December 4th\" stands not just as one of Jays finest performances to date, but Blazes, too.\n03 What More Can I Say [p. The Buchannans; w. Hartley Goldstein] \"What More Can I Say\" is the sprawling pinnacle of every element that makes The Black Album an unrelentingly inspired future classic. Buchannans, one of two unknown producers featured here, supplies a triumphant instrumental that serves as a perfect counterpoint to Jays trademark hubris and incendiary braggadocio. I mean, the track is introduced by a sample of dialogue from Gladiator: It doesnt get more epic than that, people! Merciless horn blasts, tender guitar licks, and turbulent string crescendos distract you when he identifies Martha Stewart as \"Jewish,\" but the one element that makes \"What More Can I Say\" a true marvel is that, despite it serving as Jay-Zs alleged last hurrah, it manages to sound more like a celebratory changing of the guard than a self-penned elegy by one of hip-hops greatest emcees.\n04 Encore [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum] Its a little hard to take Jays claims of retirement at face value when The Black Albums first three songs all claim to be his last and this one makes reference to \"when I come back like Jordan wearing the 45.\" But the concept of \"Encore\" makes such nitpicking irrelevant-- a track like this leaves you waiting for the comeback. Kanye West whips up a soul revue backing band complete with melancholy trumpet line and miasma-happy backup singers (\"Hooo-woahhh-WOAHHH-ohvveee\") for an imaginary mini-gig, while Jay contributes a very live-sounding performance. A posse chants for the hook while an emcee encourages crowd participation and the band idles between verses two and three. Sure, it sounds gimmicky on paper, but if anyone can pull it off its \"raps Grateful Dead\"... whatever thats supposed to mean. Keep on truckin, Jay.\n05 Change Clothes [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber] The first single! And you know its a hit already cause its rocking the worlds most reliable (and expensive) hip-hop production team. But no, and heres why not: The Neptunes, talented though they may be, have spread themselves a bit thin lately, coasting on Neptunes-by-numbers beats and Pharrells by-now-goddamn-insidious falsetto. \"Change Clothes\" is, unfortunately, one of their worst productions since Bustas \"Pass the Courvoisier\"-- the vapid, forgettable chorus and cheesy piano loop are the obvious product of an off day in the studio. Jay fares no better, like he almost knows its subpar-- just spits out a couple recycled lines, and forgoes his visual style to make room for crap like, \"Young Hov in the house its so necessary/ No bra with the blouse its so necessary/ No panties and jeans thats so necessary.\" If they could afford to cut the Dre-produced \"The Theater\", surely this-- one of two Neptunes productions on a 14-track album-- could have been scrapped, too.\n06 Dirt Off Your Shoulder [p. Timbaland; w. William Bowers] If youre old, you probably macked in a maroon Fiero ten years ago, listening to Timbaland \"get sticky\" with Jodeci. If youre young, you could still spot him behind the curtain of this anthems anti-syncopation and arcade-shogun keyboard coils. Dont be fooled by the title; the song is not a cave-in to Charlotte Beers (the dandruff-shampoo ad-exec who was until recently Bushs Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs), but that doesnt stop it from being a commercial for itself and its brand. Recapping the story of how Jay clambered from shooting birds at God while holding his testicles to being synonymous with overexposure, the song lives and dies by Timbalands battering-ram beat and laser-tag riff. \"Dirt\" is gregarious but exclusive: Its meant to shake balcony barstools, but it coyly congratulates only those who have been beaten down. The chorus is about shedding a stigma, about the actualization of a capitalist dream, about legitimacy, about arrival-- for a guy ending his career, Jays tone is suspiciously akin to pre-game smack. Because Im old, I hear the Joeski Love (\"Pee Wees Dance\") in Jay-Zs obtuse voice. Because Im young, I acknowledge that hes larger than, er, life.\n07 The Threat [p. 9th Wonder; w. Sam Chennault] I cant decide whats stranger: that Little Brother producer 9th Wonder contributed a track on Jay-Zs final album, or that hes flipping a sample of R. Kelly. But its 2003, and the entire underground/mainstream divide has been so flipped and conflated that it should come as no surprise. Nor should 9ths tendency to sound both hopelessly derivative and endlessly enjoyable; the tracks rolling piano line and classic boom-bap breakbeat recall a smoother Primo, or a Pete Rock on autopilot.\nGiven a title like \"The Threat\" and Jiggas infamous street credentials, youd expect a fairly macabre affair, but remember: This is a post-therapy Jigga (who dates Beyoncé and listens to Coldplay), not the crack slinger Reasonable Doubt introduced us to in 96. As such, the tone of the track is more comical than maudlin, and Cedric the Entertainers guest spot wont let you forget it. Here, Jigga puts Larry King on his ass and namedrops Christina Aguilera, Bill OReilly, George Bush, Halle Berry, Warren Buffet, Joe Pesci, Sammy Davis Jr., Jet Li, David Blaine, and Frank Sinatra, and, in the second verse, even tries (only half-successfully) to twist them into verbs a la GZAs \"Fame\". The song is a disappointment, unfortunately-- an easy concept lazily executed. There are a couple of decent lines (e.g. \"I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again\"), but its far from Jays finest hour.\n08 Moment of Clarity [p. Eminem; w. Ryan Schreiber, c/o Mullah Omar] We asked Mullah Omar to write this part but he wanted all kinds of special treatment. Man, you should have seen his rider, it was totally nuts! It just proves Mullah makes the perfect Eminem: hes got his gimmick (\"I WILL NOT BE EDITED!!!\") and he just keeps beating you with it over and over. But for his outrageous demands, he still hits it out of the park; the same cant be said for Em, whose shit is all just the same these days: You get your minor-chord, downtempo horror-esque piano sample (a white boy copping a white boy-- wheres Shadows kickback on that shit?), your loping/plodding canned beat, some ominous strings, and youre done. The only difference between this and his Blueprint track, \"Renagade\", is that his sound was slightly less tired two years ago. Jay, fortunately, delivers a determined verse about his fathers death, and one for Beanie Sigel. But saying he wants to \"rhyme like Common Sense\"? I cannot express my disappointment.\n09 99 Problems [p. Rick Rubin; w. Brent DiCrescenzo] Aint-It-Cool rumor has it Hollywood plans for a live-action Transformers film. Feasibility of visual effects aside, the true question of the production is how to modernize Soundwave, the behemoth audio cassette \"ghetto blaster\" Transformer, for the MP3 generation. To the director, take a note from Rick Rubins Jay-Z soundbomb: Keep it old school. Some studio suit surely wants a giant robot iPod smashing trucks, but the original concept still slays. Likewise, \"99 Problems\" towers over The Black Albums supposedly forward-looking tracks. Carrying the Decepticon analogy: The 808 kick quakes like Rumbles pistons. As the back of his toy box boasts, Frenzys \"screaming voice and belligerent manner alone could shake up an opponent, but he can enhance this effect by spinning the drum-like devices in his torso.\" So, too, does Rubin eject seismic, metallic blasts from his decks chest like tornado-thrown telephone poles taking out a, um, transformer.\nAfter years of intimate, acoustic productions for Johnny Cash and Tom Petty and his sawing work with Slayer and System of a Down, \"99 Problems\" re-establishes Rubin as THE mutherfucker with a swamis beard who invented this minimalist trunk rumble. And unlike any other track on this record, it can be said that Jays vocals matter little. Close inspection reveals dubious claims such as, \"Got beef with radio/ If I dont play their show/ They dont play my hits/ Well, I dont give a shit.\" His lips rip like Lazerbeak, but the meaning is inconsequential. Do Jays problems run deeper than Rocawear inseam durability or Bentley electrical recalls? His self-aware braggadocio goes back to those days of comedic Jamaican toasts, which potentially amuse if youre ever tempted to turn down the volume.\n10 Public Service Announcement [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton] Dictating to a labored ringing piano roll and a thunderously high-toned extended organ riff, Jay-Z once again decimates his peers in their own game, handling the school of violent hubris in a manner that embodies not just mere lyrical supremacy but actual metaphorical depth. Hova is one of few artists who can ask his listenership to follow his fashion sense while simultaneously schooling the talent pool on rhyming style in a single line: \"I got a hustlers spirit, nigga, period/ Check out my hat, yo, peep the way I wear it.\" Its also a way of saying that the genres old hat to him these days, even while it was his style that so ridiculously raised the bar. A bold statement among bold statements, this track is mastery of a style, regardless of brevity, repetition, or random use of quotations.\n11 Justify My Thug [p. DJ Quik; w. Chris Dahlen] The big story behind this track is that Madonna was supposed to give it live vocals but couldnt make the deadline. Instead, they went with Sharlotte Gibson, a longtime backup vocalist for Whitney Houston, who pulls off an adequate impression. The track is all about DJ Quiks electro beat, though, which starts out whomping and wears itself out through repetition. Sadly, not much else happens. Its easy to tag this as the simplest, weakest moment on the record-- I dont think anyone could reasonably contest that-- but on the other hand, it is nice n nasty, and hilarious for how it makes Jays thug life lyrics so unromantic and just-for-show. The lyrics moan on about gangsta code and social ills, but over that beat, he just sounds like he wants to get some ass on his face.\n12 Lucifer [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum] On first listen, \"Lucifer\" comes off a bit too close to flavor-of-the-month material for an album that promised to avoid easy singles: The accelerated Max Romeo sample could be construed as pandering to the Jamaican influences back in favor with hip-hop, and the refrain, \"Im from the murder capitol where we murder for capital,\" is wordplay a little too beginners-level for Hov. Fortunately, his verses make up for these slights by following an incredibly intricate structure, somehow managing to land on religious imagery every time the sample comes up, while Kanyes beat retains a snaky bounce without going down the obvious ragga route. If it does indeed end up a single, like \"Beware of the Boys\" itll still be jagged enough to stand out in the trend-pile.\n13 Allure [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber] This is more like it. The Neptunes come back hard from their substandard earlier offering, riding a string section slick enough to rival Love Unlimited, a pulsing kick/snare combo, and gunshots for percussive effect and good measure. Jay is particularly on point, killing line after line like a Blueprint standout. Its the penultimate Jay-Z track ever, and buoyed on that stormy, oceanic orchestra, Hov comes damn close to teary-eyed: \"Shit, I know how this movie ends/ Still I play/ The starring role in Hovitos Way.\" \"Allure\" is Jay in eternal struggle with his vices, confident as ever he can give up the game, but even the title forebodes. He knows, and when the Neptunes downshift and the chorus kicks in, reality strikes: \"But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back/ OHHH NOOOO!\" This is the sound of a career high.\n14 My 1st Song [p. Aqua and Joe \"3H\" Weinberger; w. Scott Plagenhoef] After spending most of the record summing up his life and career, Jay thankfully doesnt try to end it with the Cliffs Notes version. He instead handles his \"second major breakup\" by coupling his typically self-celebratory language with avuncular advice-- from himself and Biggie, who drops in from the afterlife-- and a rare display of humility. Throughout the sentimental closer, Jay keeps his chin up and makes the song cry with emotive, bolero-tinged production from the previously unknown team of Aqua and Joe \"3H\" Weinberger. Always the entrepreneur, Hova abdicates his throne and slips into his full-time CEO role with a series of almost memoir-like shoutouts that double as teasers for his upcoming bio, The Black Book-- in stores soon!",

        "article_text": "My mother knotted her ovarian tubes when I was five years old, barring any chance I might have at one day becoming a juvenile hipster-prodigy. See, every \"cool\" person I ever knew during my formative years was partially subsidized by their siblings: the younger sibling strove toward trendiness to act as a role model to the following generation, while the older sibling had the less proactive role of wisely plundering the influences behind the younger kids record collections and recommending similar-- and often better-- bands.\nBeing an only child, though, I had to wait until I was well into my teens to start uncovering music that got my motor purring, and even then it felt like an arduously slow and expensive habit to maintain. Added to this late-to-the-game-shame was the deplorable fact that most of the bands I discovered for myself had broken up by the time I got around to hearing them, shattering my hopes of ever experiencing the full spectrum of their music in a live setting. Yep, its too late for me, but us Pitchforkers would like to think were preventing this from happening to other kids out there.\nSo let me just say that Wetheads Come Running is momentous. Absorbing a large index of musical inspirations, Austin, Texas-based newcomers Single Frame blaze through 20 songs in a scant 37 minutes, their countless influences congealing and materializing as short, clipped pop songs that stick around only as long as their hooks can remain fresh. This thing is packed with potential summer college radio hits-- \"Comm. Jet (Creepykid Remix)\" is chief among them, with its pronounced and cooing vocals blending Modest Mouse-style vocal timing with a bargain-basement synth and a fistpumping, anthemic chorus replete with nonsense lyrics so passionate they nearly convince you they mean something.\n\"Eavesdropper Goes Solo\" slows down the tempo for a quiet march that, augmented by clacky, reverbed percussion, continually builds to fake-out climaxes before dropping back down to its impossibly catchy chorus, relating to the angst-ridden introvert with such lines as, \"The fact of the matter is/ Im always behind/ The fact is/ Im always out of place/ In my own skin/ With my own friends.\" Though certainly not as poignant as Sly \u0026 The Family Stones \"Skin Im In\", Single Frame make their point just as sincerely, and with a melody no less vital.\nMeanwhile, \"Mod Style 68\"-- quite probably doomed to be known as \"the Fugazi song\"-- has the group saluting D.C. with a joyous, geek-hardcore riot over a loping beat with harsh and rapid vocal delivery. Above the sing-song chorus, two voices call-and-respond in what sounds like a guest spot from Ian and Guy themselves, before the near-bubblegum refrain is roped in by the harder edge of the guitars and synthesizers.\nOther tracks borrow heavily from the aftermath of the Electronic Poem, resulting in a large amount of found sound constituents, established mainly in interludes such as \"Rare Paintings\", \"In the Ground\" (which electronically modulates a female voice to an operatic effect), and to some extent on \"Post Daydream Forecast Endeavor\", one of Wetheads clear standouts. One of the albums only tracks to build brief interludes into the song itself, \"Post Daydream Forecast Endeavor\" works primarily because the band has a good sense of balance: the accompaniment co-opts elements of the post-punk tradition and incorporates strongly syncopated swing-percussion thats cut only intermittently by a keyboard drone and a buzzsaw guitar-- and its all an elaborate accent for a hook so perfectly simple you might wonder how its escaped 50 years of pop songs without having ever been used.\nBetter still: on top of all this early achievement, Single Frame possess that one characteristic so rare amongst the all-too-common indie sophomore slumps: even greater potential. That the trio is already this attuned to one anothers musical instincts is pretty impressive, but the slightly undercooked sound of a couple of these tracks (\"Ive Been to a Party at This House\", \"3 Bloodless Shadows\") give the impression that, with another year or two under their belts, they could easily develop into one of indie musics frontrunners.\nWith this in mind, its imperative that this bands music be brought to anyone and everyone that has an ear for it-- which is why I wholeheartedly suggest that, during your next beer-and-cigarette trip to the local secondary school (pervert), you bring a copy of Wetheads not just for your kinsfolk, but for the chubby antisocial kid, too. Maybe that person wont need something like Cobains drugged rants about Flipper, The Raincoats, and The Vaselines ten years after the fact to develop his or her own musical aesthete.",

        "article_text": "In her broken Eng-rish, about midway through \"Chair Girl\", Japans Mutsumi Kanamori, the wife half of Sheffield-based duo Mu, creeks out the maxim that \"DJs awh wock band,\" while her husband, Baltimorean Maurice Fulton, whips Model 500 basslines around submarine alarms and a dubbed-out salsa beat. It all makes sense for a second, until I re-read the lyrics and realize that shes actually saying: \"Deejays are rocked by an electric chair girl.\" I misunderstand her, but the two impressions, be they of a dancefloor-manifesto or the sensual-personal, are both extremes that get delved into on the couples debut, Afro Finger and Gel. Lasciviously sliding along that axis between their ten songs, the fluctuation only fuels my infatuation with Mu. Hers is the heavily-FXd split personalities; his is the manic approach to beat-chopping that swallows up classic Chicago house, second-line whistles, digital uprisings, even Cubano instrumentation; and together, the couple have birthed one bizarre, brilliant album.\nOver a hairy squelch, \"Jealous Kids\" opens as damning and acerbic as LCD Soundsystems \"Losing My Edge\", berating hipsters with lines like, \"Insecure kids cant [sic] close to me/ Frightened kids cant dance,\" and, \"Bored kids are trying to kick me off/ Are we still high school kids?\" As the beat turns into nasty bleeps and a steel door the size of the Grand Canyon thuds shut on the sweaty masses, Mutsumi flips her vocal presets to the \"Another Brick in the Wall\"-style chant-chorus of \"How many days can we life for?/ How many times are we smiling?/ How many people can we know about?/ How many music can we feel to?\" sneering at the onlookers as she morphs into a digital wraith and scares all the kids off the dancefloor with abrasive shrieks.\nIts all in good fun, though, as \"Lets Get Sick\" coughs up Liquid Liquids leftfield lugies at a ferocious pace with a full minute of air-raid sirens before Mus processed voice gets beamed down to walk on Yoko Onos thin ice, cracking cold cowbells and ice-picking timbales with each four on the floor. She barks direct orders about being positive and calling in sick to work so that she and her man can lay about all day, puffing on a spliff. She even goes so far as to rhyme \"we feel each others bodies\" with \"kisses to my oranges,\" which is ticklish enough, but then proceeds to go doot-doot ahhhhhh like Stereolab used to do, before snapping out of her haze with a scream of \"Fuck that!\"\nBetween the jackhammering title track, faithful hubby Fulton draws a post-coital Calgon bath and ambient cooldown for the missus, bubbling like classic Oval or Orb in between her distorted orgasms. The sexual frankness of this track and the glitchn geisha cuss-out of \"Hello Bored Biz Man\" isnt as blatantly gaudy as cuts by electrhos like Peaches or Avenue D, although its a hundred times more psychotic. Still, no amount of prophylactic protection or chemical inoculation can prepare you for the illness of \"My Name Is Tommi\". Based on a UK television show that pits couples against each other, Mutsumi simultaneously plays the cheating boyfriend, the hysterical girlfriend, the announcer, and the Jawa-voiced host while the entire set is destroyed around them, their personas melting into an icky id-mess that wallows in the nastiest, most petulant part of human nature, complete with commercial breaks for its viewers/listeners.\nThe last half of the album embeds the most enlightening messages in its manic and intricate beats. \"Tell You Something\" strangles a late-era Funkadelic lick over what could be the \"Billie Jean\" beat, while Mu shouts over a rubbery bassline that \"Jealousy doesnt give you anything/ Lets change the way people think.../ Make a revolution to yourself.\" I start to believe her as her voice distorts into a Kelis-like tongue lashing over a pole-axed break of broken Afro-Cuban percussion and flickering glitches. She explains her predicament further: \"I tried to be nice to everyone/ I said yes to everything/ Contradiction was getting bigger in my mind/ I found a lot difference between what I said and what I think.\"\nAppropriating the melody of Talking Heads \"Once in a Lifetime\" for \"Destroying Human Nature\", Mutsumis voice gets \"screwed\" down to a slurred baritone as she plaintively wonders, \"Do you have anyone who can comfort you?/ Drugs, money, fame.../ Too many things can destroy human nature.../ I really hope you dont let yourself to lose them.\" For what will most likely be played out on the dancefloor, its a weird question to ask the revelers and ravers, the anorexic models and fashionable kids.\n2003 might go down as a year in which some rock records learned how to dance (Electric Six, !!!, The Rapture, Ssion) and some dance records learned to rock (Basement Jaxx, T. Raumschmiere, Fat Truckers), but Afro Finger and Gel straddles the diametrically opposed genres obliviously, not giving a fuck. It lashes out at the p(r)etty people with their limited vision, imploring them to put aside their differences and encouraging everyone to be true to themselves (and their humanity) above all, either between two people or between the sheets. Simultaneously fun and dark, ludicrous and serious, its a fucked-up and uplifting record. \"So we are only human/ Misunderstand each other,\" Mu confesses at one point, and the message is undeniable, even if its a bit hard to make out.",

        "article_text": "Late last year, Anthony Gonzalez announced his next album was almost complete and would be \"very, very, very epic.\" With all due respect, consider the redundancy of that statement: Since 2003 breakthrough Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts, every new and increasingly colossal M83 studio record has led to widespread crowdsourcing of synonyms for \"epic.\" What exactly was he promising other than simply another album?\nWell, throughout the past decade, the 30-year old Gonzalez has honored the tremendous impact of growing up during the golden age of CD buying by implicitly serving as a patron saint for those who treat the weekly trip to the record store as a pilgrimage and still covet the album as a physical proposition: His output always comes stylishly packaged, with cover art worth obsessing over and credits that need to be scoured in order to spot the guest appearances. Unsurprisingly, he ups the ante here by aspiring to what is still the paradigm of artistic permanence, both in terms of legacy and tactility: the double album, that occasionally ambitious, usually decadent, and almost always fascinatingly flawed endeavor of musicians convinced (rightfully or otherwise) that theyre at the peak of their own powers. Hurry Up, Were Dreaming  might be all of those things, but above all else, its the best M83 record yet.\nBut lets talk about restraint for a moment: While each side of Hurry Up would be oddly slight for an M83 album, the demands of its 74-minute runtime are hardly daunting. Its actually the easiest M83 album to consume in one sitting, a reverse accumulation of past strengths that makes for Gonzalezs most compact and combustive music yet. He continues the path set by Saturdays=Youth by easing out of the mini-movie business in exchange for pop songcraft, while trading that LPs pretty-in-pink pastels for the urban neons and fluorescents of Before the Dawn Heals Us and embodying Dead Cities mile-wide expansiveness.\nBut the most crucial change is how touring with the likes of Depeche Mode has inspired a newfound showmanship in his vocals: Previously, Gonzalez enlisted outside help, piped in plot-advancing narratives, or sang in a low, tentative murmur that submitted to its massive surroundings. But here, within the first minutes of \"Intro\", hes matching blows with the juggernaut bellow of Zola Jesus Nika Danilova to the point where its much tougher than youd think to tell them apart. Its really not too different from the first chords of \"Planet Telex\" or Lil Waynes \"Tha Mobb\" in terms of being an unmistakable sign that youre going to be listening to this familiar act differently.\nM83 have never stood for half measures in any aspect, but Gonzalez is absolutely going for it here in a way that sheds new light on known tricks: The hair-triggered drum rolls of \"New Map\" recall Before the Dawns searing car-crash fantasy \"Dont Save Us From the Flames\", but Gonzalezs nervy punctuation at the end of each line sells the idea that hes along for the ride this time rather than being a passive observer. Dead Cities \"In Church\" was the sound of blissful acquiescence, but amidst the swaggering synth-metal of \"Midnight City\", Gonzalez hollers, \"The city is my church!\" empowered and present, finding a voice for the evangelical zeal always implicit in his work.\nGonzalez has stressed Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness  as a major inspiration (and by extension, its forefather, The Wall), and its influence can be spotted in Hurry Ups power ballads \"Wait\" and \"My Tears Are Becoming a Sea\", sumptuously arranged tracks that could still be played solo on an acoustic guitar. Thankfully, he didnt retain much from \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\" or \"The Trial\", and rather than one man lashing out at the world from the safety of his own thematic construct, you feel that Gonzalez is trying to connect with it.\nAs such, the moments of indulgence are in service of the albums most endearing and silly emotions: Some might consider \"Raconte-Moi Une Histoire\" a throwaway because its \"the one about a magic frog,\" but besides embodying the whiplash emotions of youth by following the magnificent melancholy of \"Wait\", its almost eerie brightness and Windows 95-era sound effects capture a technological optimism better than a lot of artists who are trying only to do that. Meanwhile, \"Year One, One UFO\" attempts to distill the percussion-mad, organic ecstasy of Vision Creation Newsun into three minutes, while on the opposite side, \"Claudia Lewis\" and \"OK Pal\" show a mastery of slapbass-poppin, corporate funk-rock comparable to Ford \u0026 Lopatin or Cut Copy without the twinge of pastiche.\nAs with any double album, theres a temptation to strip away the instrumental tracks or simply pick the best 50 minutes for your daily commute. But the interludes here are intended to be every bit as purposeful as the singles: The shorter the track, the more evocative its title (\"Where the Boats Go\", \"Train to Pluton\", \"Another Wave From You\"). While many of them stand as intriguing meditations on their own merits, they reinforce Hurry Ups intentions to be an immersive universe-- check in whenever you want, but the magics in the exploratory phases. And why leave out what falls in between, like the thermite burst of the two-minute \"This Bright Flash\" or the stately \"When Will You Come Home?\"-to-\"My Tears Are Becoming a Sea\" triptych that serves as the connective transit between Side 1 and Side 2.\nThen again, I cant blame anyone who takes shortcuts, since the traditionally structured songs here are some of the most thrilling pop music released this year. The heavily saturated synths Gonzalez favored early in his career invited plenty of My Bloody Valentine comparisons, but whereas pure shoegaze of that nature attempts to overwhelm and obliterate, Hurry Up is like a sonic planetarium, penetrable and totally geared toward enhancing the user experience. Few artists make more ingenious use of the sheer physics of rock to this extent-- defining which synth pads strike which emotional pressure points, using percussion as explosives rather than mere elements of timekeeping, coiling the tension of a verse to make every chorus feel phenomenally cathartic even without any words.\nAt this point in the year, youd think a saxophone solo would have lost all the novelty it had accumulated over decades of disuse, yet when one pops up at the end of \"Midnight City\", it triumphantly squires the track out at the highest point possible. After a streak of staccato guitar chords and splashy cymbal hits rev up \"Reunion\", the shouts from its chorus could come from a soccer stadium or a speedboat chase. \"Intro\" is typical of Gonzalezs love for zero-gravity arrangements of massed choirs and cathedral reverb, but theres nothing buzzy or clouded about it-- as high as he takes things, you can still see everything underneath in crisp, butterflies-inducing depth and detail.\nAnd then theres \"Steve McQueen\", which somehow makes the preceding hour of music feel like its prelude. Point blank, its as close as most of us will get to being strapped inside a space shuttle, as midway through an almost unbearably tensile verse, you dont hear drums so much as afterburners kicking in. By the chorus, it simply cannot go further up, and it explodes at the perfect moment into hair-metal guitar chords and synth-led skywriting. And yet, because its almost impossible to say what \"Steve McQueen\" is about (certainly not the actor), its capable of glorifying anything you choose-- a slow motion shot of Kirk Gibson rounding the bases in the 1988 World Series, a holiday fireworks display, or getting into your car and simply celebrating the end of an exhausting day.\nIs it a lot to handle? Of course, and those who have yet to connect with M83 may wonder if the sort of incapacitating longing expressed by \"Wait\" can possibly be experienced by anyone over the age of 16 or whether theyll ever be able to afford the stereo equipment seemingly required for its intended effect. But remember, its called Hurry Up, Were Dreaming: It doesnt attempt to be a comprehensive or even realistic purview of the human experience, and lord knows theres plenty out there thats meant to capture small moments.\nIts easy to mistrust something so irrepressibly optimistic about the affective possibilities of music and to attribute these feelings to the domain of some \"other,\" whether its the 1980s, teenhood, or a pop product. Does it share some sort of commonality with \"Born This Way\" or \"Firework\", or any other entry from 2011s chart music that attempts to convince you of your own superstardom? Surely, but Gonzalez never comes off like hes selling a brand, a lifestyle, or even himself-- his lyrics remain as opaque as ever. Hurry Up instead serves as a framework to realize the marvelous capability of our dreams and daily lives, should we be open to experiencing it.",

        "article_text": "If theres anything the happy New York kids in this band have learned from listening to African music, its the difference between \"pop\" and \"rock\": Vampire Weekends debut album announces straight off that its the former. The first sound on the first song, \"Mansard Roof\", comes from Rostam Batmanglijs keyboard, set to a perky, almost piping tone-- the kind of sunny sound youd hear in old west-African pop. Same goes for Ezra Koenigs guitar, which never takes up too much space; its that clean, natural tone youd get on a record from Senegal or South Africa. Chris Baios bass pulses and slides and steps with light feet, and most of all theres Chris Tomson, who plays like a percussionist as often as he does a rock drummer, tapping out rhythms and counter-accents on a couple of drums in the back of the room. And yet they play it all like indie kids on a college lawn, because theyre not hung up on Africa in the least-- a lot of these songs work more like those on the Strokes debut, Is This It?, if you scraped off all the scuzzy rocknroll signifiers, leaving behind nothing but clean-cut pop and preppy new wave, tucked-in shirts and English-lit courses.\nThis Afro/preppy/new-wave combination has a history-- Brits like Orange Juice, Americans like Talking Heads. For now, though, its one of the most deservedly buzzed-about things around: People have been chattering over Vampire Weekend ever since a CD-R demo of three of these songs started circulating last year. (Full disclosure: One of the sound engineers of that CD-R now does freelance audio work for Pitchfork.) The excitement isnt hard to fathom. People spend a lot of time poking around for the edgy new underground thing, convinced that plain old pop songs have been done to death. But Vampire Weekend come along like Belle \u0026 Sebastian and the Strokes each did, sounding refreshingly laidback and uncomplicated, and with simple set-ups that make good songs sound exceedingly easy. (The result being not \"this is mind-blowing,\" or \"this is catchy,\" but \"I have listened to this, straight through, four times a day for the past month\".)\nNo surprise, then, that their first hit mp3 would be a song called \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\", which is sly, quiet, and casual in a way that blows away so many other bands who actively try to get your attention. Their label seems to have understood this effect, and so theyve left these demos sounding as natural as they were: This release just fiddles with the mastering, switches out a few takes in ways you wouldnt much notice, plays with the sequencing, relegates one song to a B-side, and adds a couple of great ones that you can nonetheless understand being omitted the first time.\nMost of the credit will wind up going to Koenig, whos the star presence here. By the second song, \"Oxford Comma\", the band is ticking along on little touches of keyboard and the tap of a snare drum, and hes still keeping the empty space captivating: Theres a little indie yelp to his voice, but mostly hes relaxed, conversational, and wry. (Not unlike another guy whos tried on an Afro-suave sound-- though Paul Simon never sounded this exuberant.) The person wholl probably never get enough credit turns out to be Batmanglij, whose pat, classicist keyboard arpeggios lead the way through tempo shifts and transitions, occasionally locking in with some sprightly violin parts. It all comes off as simple, jaunty, and homespun, but theres a lot of precision lurking beneath-- exactly what happens when you combine a music major and indie-pop.\nKoenig is smart and lucky, in that he gets to play the preppy angle both ways: Like a guy whos read a lot of Cheever, he can summon up the atmosphere of kids whose parents use \"summer\" as a verb and give it all the hairy eyeball at the same time. \"Oxford Comma\" is spent picking on someone who brags too much about money: \"Why would you lie about how much coal you have?/ Why would you lie about something dumb like that?\" (Then again, theres nothing more moneyed than having the luxury to find money tacky, and when Koenig adds that Lil Jon \"always tells the truth,\" you kind of suspect Lil Jon wouldnt find how much \"coal\" someone has to be all that irrelevant.)\nLater, walking across the Columbia University campus, Koenig drops a detail whose delivery always gets a smile from me, even if its thrust is hard to gauge: \"You spilled kefir on your keffiyeh.\" Koenig is a detail guy, a happy observer who never much bores you with how he feels; mostly, as befits a recent college grad, hes singing about location, about where people will go and whether theyll come back with new faces. In non-album B-side \"Ladies of Cambridge\", he cant decide whether to move there with the girl or mourn letting her go alone; \"Walcott\" whirls you through Cape Cod and then suggests getting the hell out (\"Bottleneck is a shit show/ Hyannisport is a ghetto\"); the twitchy \"A-Punk\" sees one person off to New Mexico while another stays near college and finds a place in Washington Heights. And while the faux-African backing vocals on \"One\" might be the albums only real misstep, the final line sums up where its concerns are: \"All your collegiate grief has left you/ Dowdy in sweatshirts/ Absolute horror!\"\nOf course, while Vampire Weekend have certainly benefited from our new music world of internet buzz, plenty of people have found reasons to hate Vampire Weekend from the first note, many of them having to do with their prep aesthetic and Ivy League educations-- Oxford shirts, boat shoes, Columbia University. But it just so happens that were in a moment where such things matter to people: As interest grows in clean-cut, clever indie-pop, plenty of folks would like to hear things get dirtier, riskier, less collegiate-- and in a lot of corners of the indie landscape, they thankfully are. But heres another odd parallel with that first Strokes record: Vampire Weekend have the same knack for grabbing those haters and winning them over. Bring any baggage you want to this record, and it still returns nothing but warm, airy, low-gimmick pop, peppy, clever, and yes, unpretentious-- four guys who listened to some Afro-pop records, picked up a few nice ideas, and then set about making one of the most refreshing and replayable indie records in recent years.",

        "article_text": "A contemporary master of midnight ragas, acoustic noise, and finger-picking polysyllables, Ben Chasny doesnt snag as many magazine covers as Devendra Banhart, but theres no doubt the Oakland guitarist is an equally compelling-- albeit more taciturn personality. For starters, Chasny overlaps his Six Organs of Admittance monikers Buddhist origins with paganism, astral projections, prophetic dreams, surrealism, and a reverence for outsider folk masters. Then, of course, theres his day job as a psych monster in Comets on Fire, his craggy partnership with Deerhoof co-founder Rob Fisk in backwoods experimenters Badgerlore, a touring/recording relationship with Current 93s David Tibet, and a brief European tour with Joanna Newsom this April. As lazy as it is to pin Banhart to one specific scene or motif, Chasny proves even more difficult to jam within the confines of the \"New Weird America\" tag. Its like pigeonholing John Faheys ghost.\nNow add to all of that an obvious knowledge and love of Southern Lord metal/drone and early 1990s noise. Unlike those who list Vashti Bunyan and Harry Smith as forebears, Chasny cites Ghost, Dead C, Keiji Haino, the Japanese noise label PSF Records, and the vastly underrated contemporary avant guitarist Loren Conners. In the same breath, he talks about the importance of complimenting your Incredible String Band forays with Fushitsusha, Sunn 0))), the radio on white noise, and Skullflower. So while theres no doubt he works within a folk tradition on some level, instead of tagging Chasny with the full-on f-word, it makes more sense to link him with Supreme Dicks or Tower Recordings or other acoustic-minded experimenters.\nEither way, Chasnys incredibly prolific by any standard. In 2004, his Six Organs ouput alone included For Octavio Paz-- a shadowy collection of mostly instrumental steel and nylon guitar pieces (with lovely bells and chimes)-- along with the reissues of 2000s Manifestation and 1999s Nightly Trembling. The year before he turned Nikki Sudden with Compathia and his self-titled 1998 debut received the reissue treatment. As Lou Barlow once taught by example, being so prolific can present a dud-heavy obstacle course, but thus far Chasnys yet to lay an overcooked egg. Better yet, his newest foray (the first for Drag City) is his strongest, most satisfying effort to date.\nThough his past home-recorded output never felt thin, School of the Flower is his first recorded in a studio (gone is the borrowed cassette 4-track) and the result is a dense, more three-dimensional sound. Its also his most tightly composed effort, a Zen balance between Compathias lullabies, For Octavio Pazs melancholy six-string intricacies, and Dark Noontides drifting, fractured downer psych universe. If you havent heard Six Organs yet, this is where to start.\nThe album begins with the raucous \"Eighth Cognition\", wherein Sunburned Hand of the Man/Cold Bleak Heat drummer Chris Corsano does what he does best, sluicing up an elegant dust storm part tornado/part precision rap. The churning, cymbal crash lasts for a little over a minute before suddenly dissipating and blending into the fragile \"All Youve Left\", one of Chasnys gorgeous falsetto ballads.\nTaking the whirlpool of \"Eighth Cognition\" whirlpool a bit further, the 13-and-a-half-minute title track is a guitar/drum meltdown Chasny says was inspired by John Cale and Terry Rileys seminal 1971 collaboration, Church of Anthrax. On it, Chasnys guitar turns into an infinite loop under which Corsanos free to blow to and fro. Inititating a different sense of motion, \"Saint Cloud\" drifts patiently along Chasnys soft chants and dense \"Ohm\"s, some sort of droning, increasingly spiraled feedback, and crisp repetitious strings.\nThe spare \"Words For Two\" and \"Home\" (the later with a star-kiss, Loren Connors-style guitar launch) are Chasnys tightest, most affecting vocal-and-guitar pieces to come gliding round the holy mountain. Theres also a thoughtful cover of Gary Higgins folk classic, \"Thicker Than a Smokey\" from the 1973 album, Red Hash, which was recorded briefly before he went to prison on a two-year, nine-month sentence for possession of marijuana. Chasnys take perhaps lacks the distant small-town melancholia of the original, but when he sings its haunting opening-- \"What do you intend to do young man? Where do you intend to go?\"-- there are still chills. Chasny has often covered it live and decided to \"throw it on the record to put the word out so we could find Gary Higgins.\" In fact, Zach Cowie at Drag City started writing all the Gary Higgins he could find and eventually located the red-haired folkie, who just signed a contract with Drag City to reissue his lost 1973 masterpiece. (Like the best records, School of the Flowers legacy extends beyond just its songs.)\nAs intimated earlier, School of the Flower blooms and dies rather quickly. Put more prosaically, the whole thing runs its course in just under 40 minutes. This might seem like a minimalist shame for amped-up drone junkies, but really its a tasteful (and very very welcome) gesture. More practically speaking, when Chasny reaches the final jangling sustain of the guitar coda lullaby \"Lisbon,\" he still hasnt made a misstep or tapped a wrong note, so who can blame him for achieving something so sublime and not wanting to fuck it up? Whatever its duration, School of the Flower is one of those rare, understated but compulsive collections youll want to listen to on repeat until its time to blow out the incense, dump the wine in the sink, and step fuzzy-headed into the imperfect sunlight of the prosaic, but suddenly potentially transcendent world.\n ",

        "article_text": "Storys textbook, at first: Boy comes home from college. Boy forms band. Boys band drop a couple of startlingly great records. Boy doesnt seem to notice, and goes on waxing introspective as bands career seems more and more like a prematurely begun ride into the sunset. Boy dissolves band and stakes out on solo career, releasing a couple of startlingly MOR records, the merits of which are kinda halfheartedly debated-- by now, people have divested themselves emotionally of Boy. Somewhere along the line, Boy realizes he is no longer a boy. (Heres where it gets fuzzy.) Man discovers synthesizers and becomes, once again, gloriously, a boy. Excuse me: Boy.\nPardon the oversimplification, but that really seems to be what it took for Stephen Malkmus to recover his youthful mien. Face the Truth is SMs third solo album and his first to hold the line against the work of Pavement and Silver Jews. The album fuses seamlessly three distinct strains of his songwriting, which have jostled clumsily and often collided head-on throughout his career: The lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of \"sunset nostalgia\" it abets are nothing new; but Malkmus playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation is a more recent phenomenon. Behind this happy clash of stylistic preferences is a subtly but surely revivified Malkmus, confident to experiment more deliberately than ever.\nExperimentation, wha? If youre a Slanted \u0026 Enchanted devotee, you might read any stab at reinvention as a death knell-- even though you were probably bored to tears Malkmus previous solo efforts, you crank. But Malkmus is underdog personified, and unlikely triumph was one of Pavements key draws. Another was their ability to forge illusory stylistic coherence despite their records actual heterogeneousness. Appropriately enough, Face the Truth is dizzyingly eclectic, tracing a haphazard arc and often working exactly when, where, and how it shouldnt. Opener \"Pencil Rot\" supernovas with a boxy, towering synthesizer that would sound at home in a Lil Jon beat. In marked contrast are the tracks whip-crack beat and rollicking, John Squire-referencing guitars. But rather than blend, Malkmus stacks, and the result is comfy sonic largess. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rains \"Range Life\", which quotes the same Squire lick, sounds reedy by comparison.\nFrom \"Pencil Rot\" the album leaps light years to album teaser \"It Kills\", which condenses Malkmuss jammy kick (see: Pig Libs nine-minute \"1% of One\") into something infinitely more manageable-- a lightly swung pop song streaming with sinewy lines. The pilot ad for Face the Truth features an anachronistic female model, all seafoam green jumpsuit and sprayed-stiff coif, prostrate before the camera in a sexually self-servicing pose. As \"It Kills\" makes clear, the masturbatory insinuations arent unintentional: Synths et al. aside, Face the Truth is, at its core, a great guitar record.\nIf \"It Kills\" is the fried egg squatting atop a bed of noodles, let \"No More Shoes\" stand for the whole Pho shop. Now, this sunset nostalgia business, I can see it getting pretty soporific if it werent so well executed-- especially when stretched across an eight-minute, Kiss-quoting, free-soloing odyssey. Unlike \"1% of One\", however, here Malkmus drops a quick pilot verse and hes off. Fuck that check back in periodically crap, melody. You aint my mom. \"No More Shoes\" rips for a full five minutes before returning to Earth, and when it does, its changed. Espresso buzzing. Post-coital glowing. Ate-too-much tummy aching. A tousled Malkmus yowls like a scatological beat atop the entrails, before conceding one final verse. Its virtuosic, sure, but hardly wanky: Malkmuss guitar playing has matured from artful sloven to artful sloven capable of moments of electrifying spontaneity and elegantly verbose phrasing, much the way latter-day Sonic Youth have blossomed into punk Mozarts.\nHow better to follow Face the Truths most musically longwinded number with its most lyrically concise? Malkmuss word play is generally more unabashed here than on Pig Lib, as witnessed by aforementioned \"Pencil Rot,\" which blithers in stream-of-(altered)-consciousness: \"Im here to sing a song, a song about privilege/ The spikes you put on your feet when you were crawlin and dancin to the top of the human shit pile/ Shit pile.\" But \"Mama\" forgoes the invisible ink, painting a bucolic family portrait at a canted angle: \"Mamas in the kitchen with onions/ Daddys in the back with Old Hank/ Talkin bout the lasers and bunions, talkin disability rank/ No, we didnt have too much money.\" Ive omitted the last line in the sequence because, delivered in a brittle falsetto and matched to the Jicks taut upbeat kicks, its shatteringly beautiful, and Id rather not spoil the moment by trying to decipher whats being said. Other highlights include the balls-out sloppy joe anthem \"Baby, Cmon\" and the soft-twinkling \"Freeze the Saints\", which is bathetic in the most charming way.\nFace the Truth might serve as a first encounter for a young generation of Pavement-uninitiated. If thats the case, congrats. Im genuinely excited for you. It gets even better from here. But I get the sense, also, that a growing contingent of Pavements alpha fans find Malkmus new millennium solo conquests excessive, watered down, sappy, old, etc. Well, fuck, arent we a party pooper? The reason Malkmus remains so vital is because hes aged gracefully; his music shows none of the sagging flesh of existential panic. In fact, theres still a breeziness to it that, while not as spry and unvarnished as Pavement, bespeaks a man who has no illusions about his age: Thirty-eight is young, and if \"Oil Can\" Boyd can still throw a fastball, why cant one of his generations greatest songwriters and his Jicks master a few new tricks?\n ",

        "article_text": "Beyond, the first album to feature the original Dinosaur Jr. lineup since their 1980s heyday, was so surprisingly good it was tempting to call it a fluke. Tempting, but wrong-- two years after its release, it still sounds great, on par with the early, hallowed triumvirate of Dinosaur, Youre Living All Over Me, and Bug. For any cynics still chalking Beyond up to luck, Farm should blast the scales from your jaded eyes. Energetic, confident, and catchy, its even more compelling than Beyond.\nIt certainly boasts more stick-in-your-head tunes than Beyond, or virtually any other Dinosaur Jr. album. Who knows why J Mascis writes better songs when Lou Barlow and Murph are around-- maybe theres something to the old cliché of \"chemistry,\" maybe the pair just know how to push his tunes from solid up to stellar. But whatever creates this spark, its spurred Mascis to pack Farm with riff-heavy slacker classics that rival past gems like \"Little Fury Things\" and \"Freak Scene\". Opener \"Pieces\" is a vintage display of Dinosaur Jr.s knack for grafting unruly riffage to unabashedly bittersweet choruses. The lumbering \"I Want You to Know\" follows with chunky chords that sound both heavy and bright. As David Raposa pointed out in his recent track review, the tune is impressively assured, as if Mascis has shed the need to add an apologetic tone to his guitar anthems.\nBut even when Mascis is lyrically mopey, the music pulls this sad sack up off the couch. Take the caffeinated chug of slacker-self-help guide \"Over It\". \"Can I make it here?/ Get over it,\" Mascis tells himself. \"Ive been feeling weird/ Get over it... Ive been on the fence/ Now its making sense I see.\" Even better is the pity-filled \"Plans\". The man who Thurston Moore imagined as Slacker President in Sonic Youths \"Teen Age Riot\" moans about pain, loss, and apathy-- \"Ive got nothing left to be/ Do you have some plans for me?\" But the musics adrenalized bounce makes his misery more sweet than sad. In Farms world, a good melody cures all ills.\nAs catchy and well-crafted as these songs are, they never feel restricted or overly polished. Each track is given room to grow, stretching into extended intros, impulsive solos, and oft-repeated verses. The result is both shapely and sprawling, like the mossy cartoon characters on the album cover. The aching \"Said the People\" seems to climax with Mascis crying solo in the middle, but then spreads out into another great three minutes. \"I Dont Wanna Go There\" sprawls into fuzzy detonations, like a mellowed version of Bugs noise-bomb \"Dont\". And Barlow approaches his two excellent songs with similar openness, hitting especially hard on the dark \"Your Weather\".\nWith Farm coming out around the same time as the first installment in Neil Youngs Archives project, its tempting to make a grand statement about Mascis and Dinosaur Jr. as heirs to the Young and Crazy Horse throne. Youngs genius is pretty inimitable, but there is something about this band-- the way they mix noisy guitar and punk-ish slam with sugared melodies and faded choruses-- thats Young-worthy. And as long as J, Lou, and Murph keep shooting as high as Farm, theyll end up with the kind of discography worth buying over and over again.",

        "article_text": "Alex Zhang Hungtai of Dirty Beaches isnt shy about his influences. A year after 2011s breakthrough Badlands elicited comparisons to retro-damaged ancestors Suicide, he released a recording of an improv-heavy performance in Norway that featured a \"loose adaptation\" of Suicides \"Ghost Rider\". Earlier this year, Hungtai shared the title track to the second disc of his new double-album, Drifters/Love Is the Devil, accompanied with a quote attributed to wastrel poet and professed inspiration Charles Bukowski: \"Love is a fog that burns with the first daylight of reality.\" And the YouTube account used to host the song was an abused portmanteau of Chinese director Wong Kar-wais name.\nHungtai told Pitchfork around the time of Badlands release that his media-saturated theatricality spoke to his own experience as a perpetually displaced stranger in strange lands-- he was born in Taiwan, but raised in Montreal: \"Nostalgia can be a sickness or melancholia, like how immigrants that came to North America feel homesick. I dont really have a place where I can say I was born and raised. Home is a collage of all these different, fractured landscapes that I try to piece together.\"\nBadlands was an impressive work, but it was also sonically limited, switching almost exclusively between howling open-road antagonism and evocative, soft-focus balladry. On Drifters/Love Is the Devil, all previous limitations are off the table. The double album, recorded in Montreal and Brian Jonestown Massacre frontman Anton Newcombes Berlin studio over a period of six months, is both sprawling and detailed, a sonic travelogue that takes the textural aspects of his work to impressionistic heights. Though few have heard his earlier material, Dirty Beaches catalog is more diverse than the two-headed focus of Badlands suggested. But Drifters/Love Is the Devil is more robust and eccentric than anything hes ever released before.\nThis pair of albums also represents some of Hungtais most experimental work yet, a hard left-turn from Badlands song-oriented approach. There are a few excellent echoes of that previous records sound on Drifters-- the junkyard roll of \"Night Walk\", \"I Dream in Neon\"s bad-vibes glow, the raw blast of \"Casino Lisboa\"-- but song structure is less of a concern here. This music isnt impenetrable, but for those who listen more for song structure, it might take a few listens to lock into what Hungtais doing. Much of the material collected on both discs-- each is about 37 minutes long and has its own title, though they are sold together-- comprises vignettes of varying length that exist in their own space. But a front-to-back listen starting with Drifters is the best way to take in the rich, haunting soundscapes on display.\nDrifters, focusing more on songs, is the more accessible record, but its also a confrontational work. The sole instrumental, \"Belgrade\", featuring synthetic oscillations matched with a perpetually doubled-over bass line, is chilling. Its electronic textures are submerged in pools of echo, bringing to mind vast, empty spaces that create an uneasy atmosphere; \"ELLI\" is a gothic, coldwave-leaning song about aspirational love (\"In my dreams Im always with you\"), while \"Aurevoir Mon Visage\" finds Hungtai shouting in French over tumbling drums and a low jet-engine roar: \"Goodbye my face/ It is nothing\".\nAnd then theres \"Mirage Hall\", which towers over Drifters and proves its most satisfying surprise. Hungtai has flirted with electronic music before, on 2010s Night People-released cassette Night City, but hes never operated with this kind of scope. Over nine harrowing minutes, he and collaborators Shub Roy and Bernardino Femminielli build a thick monolith of clattering techno, broken up by ethereal moans that eventually dissolve into high-pitched howling noise. Five minutes in, Hungtai enters screaming in Spanish, his vocal performance turning from muscular to absolutely blood-curdling. \nThe weatherbeaten horns and underwater ambience of Drifters closing track, \"Landscapes in the Mist\", act as something of a portal to Love Is the Devils drastic shift in sound. Hungtai has hinted that Love is a breakup album, but you dont need any context to hear this music as impossibly sad and lonely.\nBy design, Love Is the Devil is much more abstract than its counterpart; \"Woman\" is four minutes of synth and distant, irregularly plinked piano, while the second section of \"Like the Ocean We Part\" is a minute-and-a-half of what sounds like railroad field recordings. Give it time, though, and the album reveals itself as the more impressive of the two, a dense and cinematic exploration of grief and loss that is as pretty (the title tracks swelling strings) as it is desolate (\"Like the Ocean We Part (I)\"s dolorous vocals and radiant, solitary guitar). The highlight of the record-- and, possibly, the collection as a whole-- is the centerpiece \"Alone at the Danube River\", a seven-minute that features a guitar solo eventully overcome by waves of shimmering synths. In sound and spirit, it brings to mind Neil Youngs masterful soundtrack for Jim Jarmuschs gloriously empty 1995 Western Dead Man. \nFor me, \"Alone at the Danube River\" has an uncanny ability to lodge itself in my mind. After months of listening to Drifters/Love Is the Devil, its central guitar figure loops endlessly in my head, something I want to hum or whistle. And I think fits with Hungtais overall artistic intention and shows why hes such an interesting artist. These records, steeped in reference and atmosphere, draw on memory but, being so textured and tactile, they bring the focus back to the present moment. ",

        "article_text": "Change has been boiling under ever since the decade clicked to double zeros. Weve wanted more of something, and slowly weve realized what. What youre increasingly witnessing at every club, at every show, with every passing night, is the death of the horrible, awkward, uncomfortable tension of devoted music fans pretending not to enjoy music they have paid to see. Finally, we are shaking off the coma of the stillborn slacker 90s and now there is movement. Arms uncross, faces snap to attention, and clarity hits like religion. We have buried irony and pissed on its grave and for the first time we are realizing what rock music, rock shows are all about.\nFuck, was that a dream? Pavement playing the Showbox in Seattle to throngs of unwashed hippie revivalists acting as if theyd been imprisoned there by a cruel master of ceremonies, their peer and equal Stephen Malkmus? Eddie Vedder iconically scrawling PRO-CHOICE up his left arm like he bore the weight of the entire fucking world and was the only living person with this Great Important Answer to all the worlds problems? That the Dismemberment Plan-- among the first to envision this future at which weve now arrived-- called us out to our faces with \"Doing the Standing Still\" and we actually still just stood there? Its almost impossible to believe in light of music like this, music that finally places as much emphasis on real, true, palpable fun as it does on art.\nAs brilliant as this music sounds on paper and CD, nothing compares to experiencing it live. I saw it taking shape (\"but I was there!\") at the beginning of this summer in Chicago: The Rapture unleashing their primal digifunk on Chicagos stuffy Metro. As the band took the stage, two kids behind me absolutely lost their shit. Whatever it was they were doing, they were doing it alone-- at first. Ive never seen anything like that: You could see it visibly sweeping the whole room. And these kids didnt have a clue \"how to dance,\" which was part of the brilliance of it: For one, it complemented the overcompensating freaks onstage not knowing how to play, but beyond that, it was the very spirit of punk. The revelation that you didnt need formal training to start a band in 1977 and the realization that you dont need to be Merce Cunningham to dance are one and the same. Fucking nobody knows how to dance at these shows-- in fact, youd look like a jackass if you did.\nThis perceived, grand-scheme \"Importance\" of Echoes, however, is irrelevant: What matters is that it wants you to get off your ass and work it, and that youll be thrilled to oblige. Its trance-noir opener, \"Olio\" (here revised from a rougher take on the Mirror LP) sets synthetic programmed 808 beats, handclaps and ride cymbals against vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tortured wails mash Robert and Patti into one solitary Smith. Jenner is almost impressively tuneless, and whats more, it even seems unintentional-- as though hes really trying to hit that high C and settling for a half-step down after 30+ takes. Good thing it works for him stylistically, striking as totally unhinged and wildeyed, as if he cant sit still at a mike with all that rhythm whizzing past him.\n\"I Need Your Love\" sends needling synths and a growling, discordant sax subtly buzzing around Jenners nervous vocal while a punched-up house beat smacks against a minimalist bassline and sampled guitar. \"House of Jealous Lovers\"-- the unparalleled champion of 2002s summer anthem sweepstakes-- appears at a slightly more album-friendly length (five instead of almost seven), showcasing bassist Matt Safers most convincing shrieks over the slapping guitar chords that won the band their first comparisons to Gang of Four.\nOne of the greatest things about the way this record sounds is how the DFA production team has coated it in their trademark style, pitting a gritty lo-fi aesthetic against the most state-of-the-art equipment the 1980s had to offer-- which is where it differs from the dancefloor stereotype, whose overt glossiness has remained the industry standard for decades. The albums title track is one of the better examples of what Im talking about: Misleadingly opening like something off The Strokes first record, it quickly bursts into one of Echoes hottest tracks, with a sloppy, tumbling bassline, those dirty conga breakdowns, tinny guitar hits (an updated relative to the outmoded orchestra hit), and the deafening, careening carwreck ending, punctuated by Safer repeatedly screeching \"WHHAAAAAT!!!!\" at the moment of greatest impact. This is anti-gloss, but it mixes as cleanly into any DJ set as it does into indie rock mixtapes.\nVirtually every track is a highlight: I feel like Id be doing a disservice to this record by not giving a more in-depth read on the Duran Duran guitar stabs and 80s cokehead atmosphere of \"Sister Savior\", the Neptunes-esque beat of \"Killing\", or any of the three non-dance-oriented tracks (\"Open Up Your Heart\", the truly beautiful \"Love Is All\" and the somber, almost Talk Talk-ish closer, \"Infatuation\") that sound entirely out of place yet somehow manage not to disturb the flow of the album. But then Id be covering every single track on Echoes, and they cant all be that great, right?\nThe Rapture are only one of about 10,000 bands ushering in this thing thats gotten labeled \"dancepunk,\" but its important to note that they were among the first. Echoes was cut and complete over a year ago-- their \"House of Jealous Lovers\" single was intended as a teaser, but delays too numerous and boring to list deterred its release. As the record was continually pushed back, the cacophonous buzz that surrounded the single faded. People had been so excited: Here were the dance and rock undergrounds finally uniting, indie rock cultivating a new loathing and defiance for tired hipster poses and demanding the chaos of which safety and careerism had stripped it. Yesterday, after having been available on file-trading networks since June, Echoes finally saw official release in the UK (the U.S. is being made to wait until the end of next month), and its no exaggeration to say its been met with about 20% of the anticipation it would have, and should have, garnered-- if only it had come out on time.\nThats another rant altogether, but its true that the timing seems all wrong on this release, particularly since weve been inundated with a million Rapture knockoffs whove already released their own sad imitations. Liars They Threw Us All in a Trench and Out Huds S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. aside, dancepunk hasnt even offered tangible evidence of actual potential. The fact is, paradigm shifts dont happen overnight, and if the release schedules for the next few months are accurate (!!!, Out Hud, Liars, and Erase Errata all have new albums coming out), the lull in publicity this genres seeing right now is the calm before the storm.\nMeanwhile, people arent wasting time: over the course of the past few months, Ive seen them going nuts at shows youd expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Out Hud, !!!, Radio 4, Liars, The Postal Service, Rjd2), shows youd never expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Comets on Fire, Black Dice, Broken Social Scene), and shows by bands that dont deserve to be danced to in any climate (Hint Hint, Dance Disaster Movement). Bands like The Rapture have sent their message: The rock show was not meant to be a collegiate study. We have all stopped caring what snotty academics find acceptable, because now there is real, true, palpable fun, and it is the greatest liberation. You people at shows who dont dance, who dont know a good time, who cant have fun, who sneer and scoff at the supposed inferior-- its you this music strikes a blow against. We hope you die bored.",

        "article_text": "Everyone should be wary of pulling out the following two statements, but they fit Justice like a pair of $500 jeans: 1) If its too loud, youre too old, and 2) Age aint nothin but a number. Given the hilariously horrified reaction that many in the dance music community have when confronted with the music of French duo Justice, youd think they were two 300-pound rampaging Huns who sacked Berlins Panorama Bar and made off with Ricardo Villalobos and Ellen Allien over their shoulders. Instead, Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay-- high school kids when Daft Punks Homework dropped over a decade ago-- grew up, like many a young Parisian, filtering hard rock (never a French strong suit) through disco until it sounded more Judas Priest circa 1983 than Stardust circa 1998. Their \"new French touch,\" as the genres being termed, actually feels like the caress of a sledgehammer.\nThroughout †, Justices long-awaited debut album, Augé and de Rosnay genuflect again and again in front of the Stations of French Dance Music: The metallic ripples of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christos Crydamoure label, which once sizzled your ear hairs; Thomas Bangalters Roulé imprint, and its champagne kisses and Chaka Khan dreams; the coke-mirror reflections of idealized 80s keyboards in Alan Braxe and Fred Falkes work; the tongue-lolling hip-hop buffoonery of TTC; Mr. Oizos spritzing-sphincter bass and convulsing keyboards; and Jacksons OCD vocal edits. Listen to the Cassius-esque disco-twang of \"Genesis\" and tell me these guys are somehow dance-ignorant. But like two naughty schoolboys, theyve got their fingers crossed behind their backs the whole time; one thing the duo is not is reverent.\nJustice takes this history of the French rave era and blows it out by embracing 21st-century stadium-rock production. They squeeze everything into a mid-range frequency band so loud that the riffs on tracks like \"Let There Be Light\" and \"Stress\" practically cock-slap you in the face. (\"Stress\" in particular sounds like a disco-era string arranger came to an in-house orchestra with the injunction \"make it sound like Emergency Broadcast System.\") The drums on \"Let There Be Light\" and their big breakthrough single \"Waters of Nazareth\" are the rat-a-tat rhythms of electro scraping like Freddie Kruegers fingertips along the slimy walls of some basement dungeon. Thats it-- engorged electronic riffs, dizzying astringent strings, vocal samples torqued to all hell, and nasty metallic drums. Its astoundingly unsubtle stuff and bracing as fuck, a decades worth of French electronic music stripped down like a Peugeot parked overnight in a bad neighborhood.\nOf course, if thats all † was, it would be unbearable for a full hour, and Justices critics might have half a point. But the albums more varied than most folks will give it credit for. (Unfortunately, that variety also includes \"The Party\", featuring Ed Bangers abhorrent in-house female rapper Uffie.) \"D.A.N.C.E.\"-- the albums slightly incongruous, Schoolhouse Rock-esque filter-disco track-- is Justices only obvious stab at a capital-p pop crossover hit and youll certainly be humming \"Do the D-A-N-C-E, 1-2-3-4-5\" whether you want to or not after hearing it. But like Homework, † is a harsh and mostly instrumental set that nonetheless plays like the ideal crossover electronic-pop record. Justice knows how to sequence a dance album to avoid drag and boredom, a skill more suited to hook-friendly architects than a putative demolition crew. The wistful instrumental vignette \"Valentine\", coming after the one-two slap of \"Phantom Pt. 1\" and \"Phantom Pt. 2\", is like a sour, palate-cleansing appetizer between fat-rich courses in big ol French meal.\nBut well-sequenced or not, † is also a sensation-for-sensations-sake record, something French house has always excelled out-- even when its been more classy than crass. Cheekily disregarding so many things that good dance music is \"supposed\" to have-- especially, you know, bass-- and in a post-microhouse era where \"quality sound design\" is a fetishistic obsession, Justices digital distortion, 128kb-grade hyper-compression, and sometimes aggressively un-funky house sprays good taste with its pissed-up, pissed-off 3 a.m. musk. Theyve somehow managed to split dance music into a brother-against-brother battle, turning message boards into minefields and blog posts into mini-manifestos. Theres no mystery to Justice tracks, true. But whether its deep house revelers out of their heads on jacked-up gospel or folks in German basements getting down to their own form of minimalized riffing, club rats all over the world are just trying to have a good time. Even if Justice is more about throwing devil horns than doing the hustle, well, were all still in the same gang.",

        "article_text": "Sounds like Boards of Canada. In the early years of this century, you heard many electronic music aficionados using that phrase, usually in the context of an endorsement. The Scottish brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin didn’t invent a new sound, but they did take various strands of music floating around and pull them into one place and essentially perfect them. And their particular fusion was so distinctive that their name became shorthand. The appetite for the BoC was so voracious that the group’s actual output, which was actually fairly prolific in its first decade, wasn’t nearly enough to satisfy it. But that was a long time ago. Since 2006 we’ve heard a lot of music that seems spiritually connected to Boards of Canada, from Burial to chillwave, but we haven’t heard a note of music from the originators until the surprise announcement of Tomorrow’s Harvest. \nWhile BoC have always seemed comfortable inside their core sound, their records are still easy to distinguish. On Music Has the Right to Children, they mixed creepy pre-erased drones with childhood nostalgia and drums that drew from hip-hop; on 2002’s Geogaddi, the beats got harder and the unease grew more intense, resulting in an album that was still playful but far darker. Campfire Headphase, from 2005, brought acoustic guitars to the table and aimed for a more pastoral feel, but it lacked the tension of what came before. And Tomorrow’s Harvest is in some ways the flipside to Campfire, the bucolic tint swapped out for moody drones and encroaching dread. It is the most internally focused of Boards of Canada’s records. Rather than working around the edges of their sound in search of new territory, Tomorrow’s Harvest finds them drawing back toward the center.\nGiven its hermetic feel, it makes sense BoC have indicated that soundtracks were an especially big influence. They specifically invoke the work of John Carpenter, Mark Isham, and Wendy Carlos, all of whom constructed some of their most enduring scores in the late 1970s and early 80s. That was a period where analog synthesis was reaching full maturity but digital synthesis was in its earlier stages, when the tape-driven Mellotron competed for studio space with the digital Fairlight and new timbres were being explored. If the earliest Boards of Canada music still seemed inspired by Warp’s post-techno Artificial Intelligence movement, beats on Tomorrows Harvest are secondary. The tempos are generally slow, and there’s not much trickiness to the percussion. The tracks tend to create a groove and stick with it for the duration. \nThe creative energy here is directed toward building textures, which are very deep and rich indeed. The most visceral sound design in Boards of Canada’s music has tended to occur during their short interludes, but here they’ve taken some those ideas and explored them at length, filling the tracks with details that can take some time to soak in. On headphones, you can explore the tracks one motif at a time, as if each were a small landscape. “Jacquard Causeway” has a series of metallic-sounding twinkles that seems to grow out of the chords that swell underneath, and they slip in and out of phase with the underlying drums in a manner that imparts an extra measure of uneasiness. “Split Your Infinities” has bird sounds and distant noises that sound like lasers, both of which are so subtle so as to function subliminally. “Nothing Is Real” is a swirl of deep bass, stop-start drums, and a continual surging synth line that sounds like a swarm of bugs, but it also has a distant, echoing keyboard line that haunts the track like a ghost. The layering of the various sounds on a given track offers a different way in each time, so they can take on an M.C. Escher-like quality, where the tone and emotional content varies according to what you choose to pay attention to. There are sounds behind sounds and sounds underneath sounds and you can find yourself sifting through the layers, turning the pieces inside-out. \nIf Boards of Canada’s sound construction has reached a new plateau, they do seem to have left some appealing elements of their earlier approach behind. Returning again to Music or Geogaddi, it’s striking how tuneful those records were. Whether they’ve lost that ability or no longer choose to incorporate it, melody is not the focus on Tomorrow’s Harvest. These tracks unfurl, grow, and shrink, but they don’t exactly develop, at least not in the same way. The early playfulness, too, is no longer part of the equation. It’s easy to forget about “childlike” for Boards of Canada at one point didn’t just mean the ache of nostalgia or the fear of nightmares but actually pleasurable activities like clapping hands and laughing and saying funny words. And the lightness and humor-- the repetition of the word “Orange” in \"Aquarius\", say-- are something they don’t seem remotely interested in here. It’s not hard to imagine a certain kind of Boards of Canada fan missing that variety. \nSo that’s what is not here. What we’re left with is Boards of Canada’s moodiest record, a full-length tinted with atmosphere that unfolds slowly and is happy to allow you to come to it. Creating a new way to hear electronic music, as they did in the first half of their career, earned them that right to make a record that is absorbed through osmosis. And true to its patient nature and long gestation period, Tomorrow’s Harvest’s last third is its best. As they move from the ultra-simple, Music for Films-like “Sundown” through the soot-dusted “New Seeds”, with its quiet guitar grind and bell-like percussion, and then on through the arpeggiated Tangerine Dream-style “Come to Dust” and the the closing bass-pedals of “Semena Mertvykh”, it’s clear that they still, after all this time and all the imitators, own this world. And it’s nice to hear that they’re still inhabiting it.",

        "article_text": "The National became popular in a very traditional way: by releasing some really good albums, then touring the hell out of them. Theyre boilerplate indie, free of hot new genre tags or feature-ready backstories, which is something their detractors derive great joy from pointing out. If the National are important, rather than merely good, its for writing about the type of lived-in moments that rock bands usually dont write about that well. The characters in National songs have real jobs, have uninteresting sex, get drunk, and lie to one another. They do so during the regular course of a workaday week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The National arent \"dad-rock\" so much as \"mens magazine rock\": music chiefly interested in the complications of being a stable person expected to own certain things and dress certain ways.\nOn the Nationals fifth album, High Violet, those constraints are starting to wear on them, which makes a lot of sense: they wear on most people. In between patches of obtuse imagery, singer Matt Berninger sounds increasingly self-destructive. The records upbeat numbers dont cheer him up so much as commiserate with him. All of this makes High Violet a dark affair, even for a band with a reputation for sad-bastard melodrama. The National have never sounded triumphant, but they can still be reassuring, with Berningers lyrics acting as salves for our own neuroses. Six drinks in, tired of your coworkers, wishing you could just go home and laugh at sitcoms with someone? Maybe get laid? The Nationals got your back.\nWith an ever rising profile and plenty of indie-famous friends-- Sufjan Stevens and Bon Ivers Justin Vernon guest here-- the National were afforded the opportunity to obsess over High Violet. They couldve holed up and recorded an idiosyncratic, expectation-defying mess. Instead they produced an ornate, fussed-over record that sounds like no one other than themselves. Given the amount of flack they take for being a no-frills bore, simply refining their sound was arguably the braver option. They miss, occasionally-- the string-drenched closer, \"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks\", is too decadent for its own good-- but mostly, they construct gorgeous, structurally sound vignettes. There are few bands that could craft a song like \"Sorrow\"-- in which emotion acts as a character and the band turns Berningers balladry into a well paced jog-- without stumbling over their own ambitions. The guitars on \"Afraid of Everyone\" actually sound nervous; \"England\" speaks of cathedrals over properly magisterial drums. These are triumphs of form.\nBerninger is still, for the most part, a socially obsessed claustrophobe. He has upper-class guilt on \"Lemonworld\" (\"Cousins and cousins somewhere overseas/ But itll take a better war to kill a college man like me,\" \"This pricey stuff makes me dizzy\"). \"Bloodbuzz Ohio\"s magnificent chorus (\"I still owe money/ To the money/ To the money I owe\") addresses the familiar, harrowing financial burdens of adulthood. Hes best when he tones down the angst in favor of reflection or confusion. High Violet seems less likely to engender the personal connections of Boxer, but its also bigger and more engaging-- a possibly offputting combination for a band following the footsteps of Echo and the Bunnymen, Wilco, and Arcade Fire. After all, eagerness often trumps execution, and the National arent immune: For his part, Berninger looks increasingly like Dos Equis Most Interesting Man in the World, and his cryptic lyrics seem like an application for the title.\nBut the National rarely miss; when they aim for powerful or poetic, they get there. High Violet is the sound of a band taking a mandate to be a meaningful rock band seriously, and they play the part so fully that, to some, it may be off-putting. But these arent mawkish, empty gestures; theyre anxious, personal songs projected onto wide screens. Even if you dont consider yourself an upwardly mobile stiff with minor social anxiety, the National make it sound grand, confusing, and relatable.",

        "article_text": "Let me come out of the gate stating the obvious: The summer of 1996 was a fucking long time ago. I was fresh out of high school then, living with my parents in the outlying suburbs of Minneapolis, trying to craft an embryonic Pitchfork into something respectable without any prior writing experience. In the throes of that disgustingly humid, buggy summer in which it seemed I would one day die as Id lived-- navigating the road construction obstacle course on Hwy 5 and despising an oppressive day job, yet forever hopeful of some distant, supernatural delivery-- Secaucus was sunwarmed bliss, the infinite pleasure zone I couldnt stop hitting.\nBursting immediately at its seams with the serrated dual guitar blast of \"Yellow Number Three\" and \"Built in Girls\" steam-engine roar, Secaucus welcomes with a warm immediacy rare in even the most revered pop treasures, and a density whose every layer hides another secret synth melody, jagged hook or vocal harmony. The depth of realization in this record is unparalleled: every angle is perfected. Its surplus of pristine pop hooks and energetic discharge rivals the best of Built to Spill, Guided by Voices, Pavement, or any other heralded indie rock band, and tracks like the anthemic, accelerating \"Ive Made Enough Friends\", the wistful malaise of \"Wont Get Too Far\", the hurtling \"Surprise, Honeycomb\", and the emotive high-school slowdance number \"Jane Fakes a Hug\" reveal proof in spades: Beyond their euphoric harmonies, melodic rapture, and marblemouthed vocals lie some of the greatest lyrics the genres seen yet. Respectively, these songs contain tales of a nationwide murder rampage (\"Being good made me burst/ The killing got worse/ It almost got fun\"), a lovestruck abandonment of social lives (\"A rush of wonder/ This charm were under might last/ Are we too hoping/ Our years are showing and fast\"), a hopeless high school graduate who fears he wont live up to his fathers achievements (\"I cant believe Im grown/ None of my friends live at home/ Not since fall\"), and the harrowing play-by-play of a brutal divorce (\"Our oaths, our realty, a good job, a husband/ A husband or what/ Christ, Jane, Im not/ I never was\").\nBut as long ago as all of that was for me, for The Wrens, its been an eternity. The band always made themselves accessible via Internet, and as the years passed, I would frequently email to wonder when a follow-up was due-- and even as I knew they had respectable careers and families, I didnt expect it would take seven years to see release. I also hadnt known that, at the height of their 1996 U.S. tour, all promotion for Secaucus was, allegedly, pulled in a huff by Grass Records labelhead Alan Melzter when the band dared question a million-dollar contract hed tried to strongarm them into signing. It was just another in a long string of sloppy breakups that would eventually sour the band on the music industry. After endless reassurances that their third album would be out \"in a few months, we promise,\" hope began to fade that the record would ever see light of day at all. Then came word that they had actually finished the record, and-- to celebrate and prevent them from further second-guessing-- were holding a party to destroy the master tapes.\nThe package finally arrived from the band themselves: an advance, unmastered CD-R labeled The Meadowlands with makeshift artwork and tentative song titles. Excitedly, I threw it into the car stereo, and waited. Waiting. Waiting. What the fuck happened to these guys? It had been seven years, sure-- no one was expecting anything as powerful as Secaucus from middle-agers, but to say The Wrens had mellowed would almost be a joke: There was little trace of the youthful, resonant joy or ecstatic intensity of Secaucus. This was a completely different band. These Wrens were defeated, miserable, hopeless, and-- in their own words-- exhausted.\nDisappointed, I shelved the disc and stubbornly refused to listen to the final pressing, even after it arrived at the Pitchfork P.O. box loving wrapped in Tiffany-blue ribbon and paper. Which was about when everyone I knew began raving. People were stunned at my reaction: Surely wed just heard different albums? And we had, but upon finally listening to the finished version after heavy persuasion from friends, it began to make more sense. This was a completely different band, defeated, miserable, and exhausted, absolutely, but not hopeless. Defying the unwritten rule that any band breaking a five-plus year hiatus must return lethargic and sapped of inspiration before retreating again to obscurity, here The Wrens prove themselves even more shockingly relevant than before-- they have survived extinction, and, fully inspired, they are telling the tale: The Meadowlands is a crushing confessional, documenting every disappointment of the past seven years, every difficult breakup, every bad gig.\nIf The Wrens were lyrically powerful when writing from third-person perspectives about trivial fantasies on Secaucus, theyre devastating delivering their own personal failures, hardships and resignations. The breakup tracks are the least of it, and even those are masochistically autobiographical with recurring characters and story arcs bridging songs. \"She Sends Kisses\" opens on an acoustic strum and reflective accordion, increasingly piling on layers of instrumentation (electric guitar, drums, piano, vocal harmonies) while Charles Bissell reflectively croons, \"A sophomore at Brown/ She worked lost and found/ I put your face on her all year.\" \"Ex-Girl Collection\" is upbeat on the surface and conflict beneath: \"Ann slams in/ Another lightning round begins.../ Charles, I found out/ Wipe that smile off your mouth/ I think its tell-me time.\" \"13 Months in 6 Minutes\" is somber and damp-eyed, dewy guitars drenched in wet reverb and whispered vocals at the end of a relationship: \"Im a footnote at best/ I envy who comes next.\"\nBut the first-hand accounts of the bands own struggles are what really hit hard, particularly for listeners whove waited the full seven years or who have intimate familiarity with similar situations. \"Everyone Choose Sides\"-- backed by crusty guitar fighting determinedly through tape falloff, electric piano, and Jerry MacDonnells insistent, urgent drumming-- is a notable album peak: \"Bored and rural-poor at 35/ Im the best 17-year-old ever.../ Were losing sand/ A Wrens ditch battle plan.../ Everyone choose sides/ The whole to-do of what to do for money/ Poorer or not this year and hells the difference.\" And then theres \"This Boy Is Exhausted\", which blends the records brightest hooks with its bleakest lines: Over two layers of blaring guitars (one pulsing, the other jangling), more of MacDonnells colossal drumwork, and resolute background vocals, Bissells hardened vocal buzzes: \"I cant write what I know/ Its not worth writing/ I cant tell a hit from hell from one sing-along.../ But then once a while/ Well play a show that makes it worthwhile.\"\nThe Wrens are now old enough to be considered indie rocks elder statesmen (their ages range from 33 to 40), and in trading the adolescent kick of Secaucus for ripened resignation, meticulous refinement for crippling maturation, they have realized their magnum opus-- the only album to eclipse Broken Social Scenes staggering You Forgot It in People on my year-end list. The Meadowlands exemplifies what every fan hopes for when a band announces a reunion or returns from more than a half-decade of silence: that they might have somehow improved exponentially each year they hid from the limelight, resulting in a payoff so cultivated it could be called their defining achievement by consensus. Its the reason we continue to harbor mixed feelings about a Pixies comeback: odds are, it ends in disappointment-- it always does-- but The Meadowlands is that one example left standing to offer a glimmer of hope. Black Francis, tomorrow this could be you.",

        "article_text": "When it comes to spazzing out, it pays to be mindful of the basics. Sure, convoluted meters, intricately layered guitar noise, and vintage synthesizers made of only fishing wire and toothpaste are nothing to scoff at. But the essence of spaz has little to do with the aesthetic goodies that so often adorn it. And at the core \"spazcore\" lies a mixture of energy and humor that, when done right, can be just ridiculously infectious. While countless forgotten bands have turned out generic garbage in hopes of hitting the big time and getting chicks, artists like Gary Wilson and Brainiacs Timmy Taylor seemed driven by an uncontrollable impulse to not look cool, tempered by a profound understanding of their own ridiculousness.\nWhen Need New Body dropped their insane, fractured and brilliant debut in 2001, it was abundantly clear that they deserved a place in this esteemed tradition. That albums centerpiece, the epic \"Gamble On/Banji\" was not only one of my favorite songs of 2001, but one of maybe ten songs ever that invariably inspires me to jump around like a total jackass, regardless of social setting. UFO, Need New Bodys much anticipated sophomore effort, offers up both more variety and more focus than its predecessor, as the band plows through under-a-minute goofs and involved jams with equal conviction and care.\nAs with their debut record, Need New Body hardly decided to put their most accessible foot forward with UFO, opting instead to open with the distorted drums and seemingly random noise patterns of \"Giggle Bush Meets CompUSA\". Just as the song disintegrates into hard-panned video game noises, in comes \"Hot Shot\", a standout track and a pretty good template for the more accessible side of the album. At their most basic level, these songs consist of the band playing a \"My Sharona\" bassline and banging on things, but what makes them so spectacular is the unchecked energy with which the band approaches them, fueled in no small part by Chris Powells frenzied drumming. UFO is a remarkably dense record, but even more remarkable is the fact that every single sound is integrated so masterfully into the framework of Powells insistent 4/4 beats.\nNeed New Body achieve some of their greatest moments when the aforementioned beats are transformed into something loosely resembling a pop song. \"Show Me Your Heart\" is equal parts video game soundtrack, spy theme, and banjo-driven klezmer jam. Banjoist/emcee/\"singer\" Jeff Bradbury may not be the most traditionally skilled vocalist, but he has a knack for rhythmic sing-speaking that perfectly complements the rest of the band. Bradburys contribution to live favorite \"Pen\", with its unforgettable chorus of \"Pen pen pen/ Wheres my pen,\" is not only hilarious, but lends the song yet another layer of rhythmic intensity.\nThere will always be artists who go through the motions of \"freaking out\" in the hopes of soliciting a few extra cheers at shows, or injecting some energy into an otherwise painfully dull record. But Need New Bodys enthusiasm, coupled with their adeptness at creating music both substantive and brilliantly eccentric, proves legitimate. Make no mistake, friends, this is the real thing.",

        "article_text": "Its that moment every indie kid irrationally fears: your favorite band gets the call-up to the majors. Now that theyve come to prominence via the California-based indie Darla Records, its My Morning Jackets turn to risk their careers and financial stability for a shot at recording a real statement album backed by a serious budget. But somethings not right here, or maybe somethings too right: Jim James high, lonesome croon is still recorded in a grain silo, and the bands sound is still a cathedral of reverb, but where you might expect grandiose 40-piece orchestras, bombastic gospel choirs and glossy, state-of-the-art digital effects, you will find only the vast, empty space that has always accompanied the bands instrumentation, allowing each note to resonate indefinitely, unhampered by unnecessary density. Rest assured, the faithful will have no problem kneeling here.\nLast years exploratory Chocolate \u0026 Ice EP left quite a few open questions about the bands future direction, many signals of which could be found in the 24-minute electro-funk centerpiece \"Cobra\". But It Still Moves almost immediately confirms that the spacy Southern psych that My Morning Jacket built their name on remains their bread and butter. \"Mahgeetah\" is full of the long, drawn-out vocals that made \"Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?\" such an affecting and seemingly meaningful question; it also carries over the texture of that song, building a small epic out of the same elements. The band reacts to each verse differently-- once with explosions of glimmering arpeggios, later with Johnny Quaids beautiful, understated guitar solo-- before bringing the whole thing to one of those thunderous conclusions that makes classic rock live albums such a guilty pleasure.\n\"Golden\" trots through a glowing haze of reverb on Patrick Hallahans steadily brushed beat, its lilting finger-picking and ghostly harmonies falling somewhere between The Bands stately Canadicana and The Byrds \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". \"One Big Holiday\" doesnt look like much from the lyrics in the liners, but when James grabs hold of the opening line, \"Wakin up feeling good and limber,\" and draws it out in his singular way, it feels about a million times more weighty than it probably should. Near the albums midpoint, the reverb reaches such titanic proportions that James drifting vocals begin to rival Sigur Rós Jon Thor Birgisson for shear ethereality, particularly on a track like \"I Will Sing You Songs\". Its like listening in the throes of a lucid dream.\n\"Easy Morning Rebel\" puts your feet back on the ground with its swinging arrangement and Memphis horns (actually played by veteran Stax session men-- one of the rare frills here made available by major label dollars). And then, finally, the band leaves James alone in his silo to close the album with the searching, desperate \"One in the Same\", a song that finds him seemingly trying to sort fragmented memories into coherent thoughts. When he hits the lines, \"It wasnt till I woke up/ That I could hold down a joke or a job or a dream/ But then all three are one in the same,\" it should put a lump in your throat.\nAnd with that, It Still Moves strums to a close, an album by turns beautiful and possessed, by others raucous and fiery. If youre standing by the record racks trying to choose between this and the bands other major achievement, At Dawn, flip a coin; either way, you win. My Morning Jacket have made the move to the bigs in tremendous style, and as far as I can tell they havent compromised a thing to be there. If theres one major flaw I could point to here, itd be the albums length-- 74 minutes is a long runtime for any record, and as a result, the album is usually better off listened to in chunks-- but thats a small concern considering the riches that await inside.",

        "article_text": "WERE JUST TALKING... TO THE KIDS!\nWhen you start to measure the amount of music you listen to in gigabytes and jumbo-size Case Logics, its easy to forget the awesome power of the simple declarative statement. Nothing against all those 30-piece ensembles, nautically focused concept albums, intricate field-recording pastiches, and three-hour drum circles that dominate our musical neighborhood, but sometimes its refreshing to hear a band maximally juicing a single sentiment down to two-minute concentrate. Meet South Londons Art Brut: Theyre here to fill that vacancy.\nIVE SEEN HER NAKED, TWICE! IVE SEEN HER NAKED, TWICE!\nThat its difficult for me to find a recent point of reference for Art Brut is a testament to just how self-serious indie rock has become-- although they do share a refreshingly bratty quality with proto-punks like the Buzzcocks and Television Personalities. Frontman Eddie Argos even appears to share Joey Ramones love for first-person narratives that sound no more complex than a transcript of just-some-guys thoughts on a completely unremarkable day. Ruminations on ex-girlfriends, new girlfriends, little brothers, modern art, his band, other bands, Italian currency, Los Angeles-- all are expressed in language too shallow for even diary-scrawling, but lifted up to anthemic status through sheer multiple exclamation-point enthusiasm.\nI CANT STAND THE SOUND OF THE... VELVET UNDERGROUND!\nOh my God, heresy! But of course, its only half-serious, a joking reminder to todays bands that VU ended up writing (gasp!) unabashedly fun songs like \"Sweet Jane\" and \"What Goes On\", too. If these sloppy, succinct three-chord bashers fail to tread any ground that isnt already well-worn, they do so in an appealing way that underscores Argos oscillations between humility and delusions of grandeur. Art Brut might display more versatility than one-tempo Ramones, but not by much, contenting themselves with fast songs (\"18,000 Lira\", \"Bad Weekend\") or slow songs (\"Rusted Guns of Milan\", \"Stand Down\"). Its just enough to give these minutiae-obsessed songs their paradoxical fist-pumping grandeur, and not a bit more.\nNO MORE SONGS ABOUT SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK N ROLL... ITS BOOOOOORING!\nThat this line comes amidst the albums most straight-ahead rock number-- and that about 90% of Argos lyrics discuss these very topics-- is probably the best joke on the album, though its not wanting for humorous company. The sly origin story \"Formed a Band\" and art-fetish celebration \"Modern Art\" (both re-recorded here from their 2004 single versions) may have laid the foundation of Art Bruts blog rep, but Bang Bang Rock \u0026 Rolls new material is equally hilarious when it aspires to be. Argos paints the perfect picture of musical awakening in \"My Little Brother\", the subject of which expresses his frustration through mixtapes of \"bootlegs and B-sides,\" and makes \"Emily Kane\" more than just a casual remembrance of young love by being able to recollect the last time he saw her, right down to the second. Its tempting to think of Art Brut as the foreign replacement for the catchy/clever observances Weezer used to traffic, the escape fantasy of \"Moving to L.A.\" obliterating the clichés of \"Beverly Hills\", with its shirtless motorcycling, hanging with Axl and Morrissey, and foolish tattoos.\nHAVENT READ THE NME IN SO LONG... DONT KNOW WHAT GENRE WE BELONG!\nWell, let me try to help. See if you can follow this: Art Brut, through their thoroughly unpretentious embrace of pretentiousness, are the most punk new band Ive heard in years, punk having lost itself long ago to the pretentiousness of unpretentiousness. So even though Argos boasts of wanting to \"write the song/ That makes Israel and Palestine get along,\" and planning to perform Art Bruts hit eight weeks in a row on \"Top of the Pops\", any chance you might take him seriously is deflated by the little meta-moments like the one caps-locked above. As with the best LCD Soundsystem singles, Bang Bang Rock \u0026 Roll is at times some of the best music criticism going right now, and far better than our boringly verbose bullshit cause you can dance to it.\nAND ART BRUT, WEVE ONLY JUST STARTED!\nThe optimism of that statement is infectious and hard to argue with, though Im perfectly aware of the large pile of empty Brit-hype firecrackers that went off with a barely a whimper Stateside. Given their reliance on dry English humour (yes, two us) and lack of a timely U.S. distribution deal, its unlikely Art Brut will fare well as well with North American listeners as fellow countrymen Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads. But then, just a year ago, it seemed unlikely that any of those bands would find fans in the States at all, let alone enough to spark yet another small-scale British invasion-- and all told, its not hard to imagine their dagger-sharp guitar lines and pop-fueled bash carving its own niche in those other bands wake if given the opportunity. The only thing to do is start a letter-writing campaign, suffer the import prices, and hope Art Bruts got enough in their tank for another album or two. I cant wait to hear \"Recorded a Sophomore Album!\"\n ",

        "article_text": "Sometimes I think it cant be a matter of simple coincidence that sound, when rendered visually, appears as ever-changing green fluctuations stretched over an infinite black void. The power of music to seemingly construct, alter and distort space can be staggering. Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts, the second album from French electronic duo M83, nicely epitomizes this: The sound is absolutely huge, its relentless attention to detail eclipsed only by the stunning emotional power it conveys. For fifty-seven glorious minutes, its impossibly intricate tapestry of buzzing techno synthesizers, distorted electric guitars, cheesy drum machines, and subdued vocals generate a sense of bodily movement through a landscape of beauty, disappointment, glory, and decrepitude. Dead Cities not only envelops you, but also affords you room to explore its vast expanse.\nOne remarkable attribute of Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts is how vastly M83s sound palette differs from the ones most often used to create music possessing this much beauty and depth. Countless musicians have humanized electronic sounds by generating tones that feel warm or organic, but M83 have undertaken a different challenge: to convey beauty through the familiar, filtered buzz of the kind of cheap synthesizers usually found in techno and dance tracks. Paradoxically, the sounds that have constituted some of the most vapid, hedonistic, and forgettable music of our time have now returned to make us cry.\nM83 open Dead Cities with one of their most striking misappropriations of trite instrumentation. In \"Birds\", a tinny sample of chirping birds is combined with swells of synth strings and a computerized voice repeating, \"Sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are growing, clouds are looming and I am flying.\" The computerized voice is run through an odd, wavering melodic filter that affords it just the right degree of harmonic dissonance with the accompanying synths, and it takes on a decidedly unsettling feel, repeating its mantra-like invocation of the unsteady world youre about to enter.\nOnce inside, youre exposed to a landscape of seemingly infinite depth and complexity. Rather than just ending, sounds and songs disappear off into the horizon, continually bringing a promise of something familiar but unforeseen to follow. \"Unrecorded\", the first full-fledged song on Dead Cities, makes clear the reason M83 have drawn so many My Bloody Valentine comparisons. Building upon a foundation of fuzzed-out guitar, rich bass, synth strings, and a drum machine that sounds surprisingly like the acoustic drums of Loveless, the duo layers burbling techno synthesizers into complex rhythmic intersections as the songs vast backdrop slowly fades away. Just as My Bloody Valentine refashioned distorted electric guitars as instruments capable of divine and volatile sound, M83 recast harsh sawtooth waves as voices of reflection and regret. On \"Run into Flowers\", almost-real strings and whispered vocals are juxtaposed with overdriven drum machine clicks, as an insistent 4/4 beat evokes lush, green fields as easily as abandoned factories and polluted rivers.\nThis kind of contrast factors heavily into \"In Church\", as a clear pipe organ and an angelic, reverb-laden chorus are assaulted by blasts of white noise. Finally, a wrenching, synthesized melody enters, providing a profoundly moving counterpoint to the sterile beauty that preceded it. By the time you get to \"0078h\", its impossible to tell whether the heavily altered vocals are of human or computerized origin; its also completely ceased to matter. Oftentimes, the most organic sounds on Dead Cities are the most formless, and the most glaringly synthetic sounds the most emotional.\nDead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts ends fittingly with the 14-minute epic \"Beauties Can Die\", which recalls at first the melodic, pastoral electronica of Múms Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is OK. This peaceful opening is soon overtaken by a sound that gradually transforms from a low, earthquake-like rumble into a blast of synthesized static. Synthesizers and harmony vocals are layered and layered until the sound is so explosively, beautifully gigantic that you wont mind its damaging your hearing. More earthquake rumbles follow, each ushering in even more layers of ungodly gorgeous sound and evoking a stomach-turning combination of fear and excitement. At the crash of a synthesized cymbal, the song descends into submerged ambience, and ultimately into a long silence, before resurfacing with distorted radar blips and shrieks of howling noise.\nAs \"Beauties Can Die\" fades, youre left with the feeling that youve just returned from a journey-- that the images passing through your mind for the last hour couldnt possibly have been the result of mere imagination. An album like this extends far beyond your speakers, guiding you through an impossibly rich, detailed world of sound while also giving you room to explore it yourself; you dont listen to Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts, you inhabit it.\n ",

        "article_text": "When Pitchfork electronic music guru Mark Richardson notes that theres been a \"perceptible dip in interest in experimental electronic music in recent years\"-- as he recently did in his review of Fenneszs exceptional Venice-- Im inclined to trust his judgment. Whats always reluctantly been called IDM does seem less compelling by the day, victimized by both process music that makes for a better backstory than listening experience and a roughly three-year flood of experimental electronic refuges seeking shelter in the more rewarding and head-turning world of tech-house.\nThe rise of tech-house-- and its annexation of the best work of former Clicks \u0026 Cuts-style producers such as Vladislav Delay, Hakan Libdo, Reinhard Voigt, and Jan Jelinek-- may seem like a very large nail in IDMs potential pine box, but it also pointed a way forward for electronic head music. The message: Shave your beard. Loosen up. Have fun. Since then, several artists have pulled off the trick by re-engaging with clubland, making music that-- while compelling in any environment-- often works best in a dancefloor context.\nJason Forrest doesnt make dance music, but unlike most IDM producers he doesnt shy away from the vitality and immediacy of it, either. Forrest is still probably best known as Donna Summer, former host of WFMUs \"Advanced D\u0026D;\" radio program and leader of the impish breakcore collective Cock Rock Disco. That tag is essentially what The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash sounds like: brash and big, furious and frantic, and best enjoyed loud. And its performed with a sly wink and nods to everyone from Prefuse 73 to dj/Rupture, while drawing samples from sources as diverse as Talking Heads, Elton John, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and The Who.\nForrest isnt much for minimalism. Perhaps a lesson learned from his WFMU days, he offers his listeners instant gratification-- which is a good thing, as these days, our fingers twitch just as impatiently over the iPod dial as they do the radio tuner. So, like The Avalanches Since I Left You or Basement Jaxxs Kish Kash, this is a maximalist record. Sounds and ideas come quickly, make their points, and never outstay their welcome. In that sense, The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash is also inclusive, a post-mashup dragnet that sweeps metal, drill-n-bass, gabba, disco, and familiar FM rock staples into a single pie and then slices it with precision.\nFor about 40 seconds, album opener \"Spectacle to Refute All Judgments\" seems like another example of music-making that struggles to make the leap from idea to execution, as Forrest applies to disco the slice-and-dice aesthetic that Scott Herren has used on hip-hop. Then comes the first guitar solo. And the big glam stomp. And the second guitar solo. And the drum solo. And... well, it quickly becomes clear that Forrest has a lot of cards up his sleeve, and little interest in holding any of them close to his chest for any length of time. Which works beautifully: \"Satan Cries Again\" tears through CCRs jungle, pausing only for a motorik pep rally; \"An Event (helicopter.passing.(edit).251001.mp3)\" is solemn and hypnotic from a distance before being swept up in the winds of a clusterfuck of organ sounds; and \"180 Mar Ton\" sounds like the Amen break crossing the river Styx.\nThe liberal sampling of classic rock on what is at heart a disco-cum-noise record shouldnt be much of a hurdle for potential fans to jump: The arena-ready guitars serve the same sort of capacity as breakbeats do in Big Beat records-- as patient, friendly guides for those who dont normally listen to electronic music-- while the sensual futurism of \"Ceci Nest Pas du Disco\" or deep house tribalism of \"INKhUK\" is far too infectious to be ignored, even by the biggest guitar-phobics.\nForrest does, however, have The Who to thank for his show-stopping album closer, \"10 Amazing Years\". The records most ferocious and Unrelenting track, its also oddly the most patient and straightforward, eschewing most of the ADD tendencies of the rest of the album. Except for a heavily reprogrammed Ringo Starr drum solo and an extra kick of guitar at the end, its essentially filter disco meets classic rock. Its The Who in their prime covering \"Da Funk\", with a half-dozen or so bare and, yes, fairly minimal elements drifting in and out of the track at different times before they all come crashing together for one glorious finale. Were it at the start of the record, it would cast a long shadow over the rest of it. As it is, it just makes you want to dive in and hear the whole thing over again.",

        "article_text": "Its no secret: Les Savy Fav like to fuck shit up. Baldly transgressing the most basic assumptions about rock singers, the bands frontman is a pudgy, bearded, wild-eyed freak whose unpredictable stage show tends to scare off men and women alike. Their studio output varies from barked, discordant indie anthems to synth-heavy art-punk. And their new singles record, Inches, reverses all the usual rules that compilations of its ilk abide by.\nFor most rock bands, a singles compilation is an afterthought-- an offhanded concession to fans who may have missed out on the limited pressings. For Les Savy Fav, a singles compilation was a forethought, conceived before the band had even recorded a song for it. Now, seven years after its conception, the career-spanning project finally comes to fruition, collecting the A- and B-sides of nine seven-inches, all originally released by different labels.\nFor those whove been keeping up with these singles, the excellence of Inches is a foregone conclusion. While many contemporary indie bands reserve their singles for the release of marginal or subpar material, Les Savy Favs tend to offer songs that are not only better than the bands album cuts but, despite the disparate conditions of their production, more consistent as well. For a band so prone to brilliant and exhausting outbursts, its not surprising that their defining album would come in this form.\nAnd without a doubt, this is Les Savy Favs defining album. The high points on Inches are not only the finest songs the group has ever recorded, but are also the most indicative of their strengths as a band. \"Our Coastal Hymn\", released in live form as a hidden track on The Cat and the Cobra, is possibly the catchiest song in their entire repertoire-- hook after blistering hook, all energized by the bands trademark frenetic grandiosity. Never overpowered by its angularity, \"Our Coastal Hymn\" is less an anthemic punk song than it is a pointy anthem, unconventionally catchy and tremendously forceful.\nTracing the bands chronology backwards, Inches shows Les Savy Fav continually reshaping and revitalizing their sound with new textures, and expanding their palette of both sounds and approaches to recording. The albums newest track, \"Meet Me in the Dollar Bin\", is a sparse and direct dance-punk epic, with Harrison Haynes terse, robotic drumming perfectly anchoring frontman Tim Harringtons pained screams. Les Savy Favs most recent LP, Go Forth largely failed to sustain itself, as the bands energy was substantially defused by Phil Eks production, but Inches diverse pacing allows even the Ek-produced \"Fading Vibes,\" on which the band revisits the more straightforward guitar-rock sound of their first album, to stand out as one of the best and most unique recent Les Savy Fav tracks.\nOf all the remarkable tracks on Inches, \"Yawn Yawn Yawn\" remains my personal favorite. Here, Seth Jabours endlessly inventive guitar playing is in top form, masterfully and subtly building from a clean, rhythmic figure in the verse to a soaring, distorted chorus. Lyrically, the song is further proof that Harrington has more in common with Daniel Bejar and John Darnielle than he does with his harder-rocking contemporaries. Like many of Les Savy Favs songs, \"Yawn Yawn Yawn\" explores themes such as sex, partying, decadence and disaster. And, as usual, Harrington relishes his words like a storyteller, delivering them with both conviction and humor.\nThe first pressing of Inches comes with a bonus DVD that further solidifies its status as Les Savy Favs most essential and representative release. Videos of three songs from a 2003 performance at Brooklyns Northsix provides a welcome glimpse of the awe-inspiring Les Savy Fav live experience. Although Harringtons theatrics are usually the most frequently discussed aspect of Les Savy Favs live show, the distance provided by the footage puts the emphasis largely on the virtuosity and spontaneity of the bands individual players. And the video of \"Who Rocks the Body\" is just fucking hilarious, as Harrington asks a stuffed rabbit, \"Who rocks the party that rocks the bunny?\"\nUnfortunately, Harringtons notorious live antics have resulted in many people writing off Les Savy Fav as a joke or a novelty. And without a doubt, the bands previous recorded output has largely failed to demonstrate the musical prowess spoken of by their fans. But Les Savy Fav have always demonstrated a uniquely off-kilter sense of humor, and it seems strangely fitting that the very album their fans have been waiting for has, in fact, been underway since the band formed. With Inches, Les Savy Fav brings together a full seven years of solid musicianship, deviously catchy songwriting, and explosive punk rock energy, discarding all the gratuitous dissonance and convoluted song structures that often plague \"post-punk.\" Finally, this is Les Savy Fav.\n ",

        "article_text": "Like so many honky-tonk singers of her own and previous generations, Loretta Lynn was always a little country-come-to-town, a rural-raised girl in the big city whose pre-fame struggles lent her music grit and authenticity. Born in a Kentucky mining town called Butcher Hollow, a teenage bride and a mother several times over before she even arrived in Nashville, Lynn sang with a hill-country accent (notably different from typical Music Row stars) and with the unchecked candor of her toughening experiences. In this smoothly defiant voice, she sang of her mans and her own cheating ways, as well as the hardships of motherhood, wifehood, and celebrity as if each were one and the same-- and they probably were.\nIn Nashville, she was a rough in the diamond: Her hard-edged songs like \"Fist City\" and \"Rated X\" were backed by pristine countrypolitan production-- mostly courtesy of Owen Bradley-- which helped sell her to a wide audience. At the same time, the disparity between her voice and her accompaniment created a fascinating rural/urban friction that never let listeners forget that she was less a superstar than a small-town girl at heart. Crucial to her image and her success, the depth of Lynns noncelebrity is perhaps why her old material still bristles and burrs even today.\nOn her new album, Van Lear Rose, producer and admirer Jack White (who dedicated White Blood Cells to Lynn in 2001) immediately erases that friction with a rawer, in-one-take live sound that adds texture to her songs without overpowering her voice. Whites intention isnt to update or revise Lynns music or her persona, but simply to recast her voice in a new setting, to make her sound like shes right back in Butcher Hollow.\nTo this end, White has corralled a backing band that consists not of Nashville veterans, but of young uns from the decidedly non-rural locales of Detroit and Cincinnati. Dubbed the Do Whaters by Lynn (\"I named them that because they got in there and did whatever we needed them to!\" she explains in the liner notes), the group consists of The Greenhornes rhythm section Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, with Blanches Dave Feeny adding elegant pedal steel and slide guitar flourishes. Together, they prove a dynamic backing band, able to set a warm country atmosphere but not afraid to make some rock noise.\nAnd they do just that on the first single, \"Portland, Oregon\". Lynn and White exchange verses about sloe gin fizzes and drunk lovin, recalling her adultery duets with Conway Twitty but with more of a boisterous sound, courtesy of Whites Zep blues riffs. On \"Mrs. Leroy Brown\", the band bang out a bar-stormer to match Lynns adventures riding around town in a pink limousine. Even bigger than that limo, though, is the unmistakable smile on her face as she disses her man and his floozy: \"I just drawed all your money out of the bank today/ Honey, you dont have no mo.\"\nIf Van Lear Rose recasts Lynns sound, it also revisits the subject matter of her earlier hits, following her stories through to their sometimes dire ends in songs like \"Womens Prison\" and \"Family Tree\". But on the albums most memorable songs, Lynn tells her own story, singing in no other voice but her own, and it still soars with surprising grace and with all the sass and intimacy of her younger self. Most of Van Lear Rose is autobiographical, relating her life in both Butcher Hollow and Nashville with evocative detail and steady candor. The title track, for example, recalls her fathers stories about her mother and \"how her beauty ran deep down to her soul.\" Her voice trembles with a tender, nostalgic wistfulness, especially when she remembers how the miners teased her dad: \"Youre dreamin, boy, shell never look your way/ Youll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose.\"\nAfter the spoken-word reminiscence \"Little Red Shoes\" and the devastating widows lament \"Miss Being Mrs.\", Van Lear Rose ends with \"Story of My Life\", which is exactly what its title purports. The coal miners daughter happily relates the events of her life-- early marriage, motherhood, stardom-- leading up to the present, but instead of dwelling on hardship and tragedy, she sounds satisfied, even joyful. Its perhaps a testament to her modesty that she winds up this autobiography in less than three minutes, but by songs end, her contentment feels undeniably hard-won and admirable: \"I have to say that Ive been blessed/ Not bad for a country girl, I guess.\"\nLynns triumphant return on Van Lear Rose isnt exactly unprecedented: Ten years ago, Johnny Cash won a younger audience with the Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings, and George Jones, Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, and Willie Nelson have all released strong albums late in their careers. Nor is it surprising that fans would flock to such sturdy music, that critics would celebrate such a comeback or pursue such a great story. But the rating above does not reflect critical sentiment as much as it does critical amazement: Van Lear Rose is remarkably bold, celebratory and honest. Its a homecoming for a small-town musician gifted with poise, humor and compassion, but at its very heart, its happy to be just a kick-ass country record.",

        "article_text": "Its a bit late to be talking about New Years Resolutions, but mine was to dig through the boxes upon boxes of promos that arrive at the Pitchfork mailbox each month, and listen intently to hundreds of them in one sitting, in an attempt to discover those rare, impossibly great bands that would otherwise slip through the cracks. Its been an absolute bitch so far, and awfully disheartening, but Ive hit paydirt a couple of times, and in those moments of glory, its been worth wading through every cut-up Cuban big beat record, every generic Midwestern rock record, every bar band, every swing band. See, the problem is, its impossible to know whats what; you have to just dive in and hope for the best, because sometimes the bands with the worst names and most hideous packaging are just great musicians who would make terrible image consultants.\nCase in point: Broken Social Scene. No one wants to admit that they like a band that goes around calling themselves this-- a band who, judging from their artwork, stands around all day looking pensive, crouching, and feeling the music in dramatic grayscale, a band that finds its home on Arts \u0026 Crafts/Paper Bag Records, who puts the message \"break all codes\" above their own barcode, and who dedicates their album to their \"families, friends and loves.\" I already had them pegged! How could they not be the most unimaginative, bleak, whiny emo bastards in the whole pile?\nI dont know. But this disc is nothing like youd imagine. Not even almost. Ive been over it again and again looking for some cause, some reason, anything, that would compel a band with this much unfiltered creativity and kinetic energy-- a band without even the slightest suggestion of tear-stained poetry or bedroom catharsis-- to fall victim to the worst possible Vagrant Records clichés. I cant find it. All I know is that when I press play, and this disc whirrs to life, it inexplicably sheds its crybaby façade and becomes... sort of infinite.\nIve been listening to this disc for months on repeat-- sometimes just this disc for days-- but it wasnt until I began doing research for this review that it began to make sense how a band like this could materialize from out of nowhere with such a powerful and affecting album. I knew from the liners that the group has ten members (fifteen if you include guests); what I didnt know was that all of them have been wandering from band to band within the wildly experimental Toronto music scene for years, or that they all came together from groups like Stars, Do Make Say Think, Treble Charger, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Mascott with the unified goal of making, of all things, pop music. One of its members told a Toronto weekly that \"wed already made our art-house albums... the whole ideology of trying to write an actual four-minute pop song was completely new to so many of us.\"\nWho could have imagined it would come so easily? You Forgot It in People explodes with song after song of endlessly replayable, perfect pop. For proof, pick virtually any track: the sound barrier-bursting anthem \"Almost Crimes\", the subdued, gossamer \"Looks Just like the Sun\", the Dinosaur Jr.-tinted \"Cause = Time\", or the shimmering, Jeff Buckley-esque \"Lovers Spit\". And theres plenty more where that came from. How about the chugging guitar-pop of \"Stars and Sons\", which spins a distant, churning keyboard drone beneath the best moments of Spoons Girls Can Tell and punctuates it with a barrage of percussive handclaps. Or \"Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl\" which showcases Emily Haines melting alto caught in a beautiful, cyclical refrain and intensely modified by vocal effects while violins float atop subtle banjo plucking and cascading toms. Or \"KC Accidental\", which blasts searing, super-melodic guitar, a drumkit alternately galloping and relentlessly beaten, and an impenetrable wall of accelerating orchestration, before crash-landing into a deliquescent pop lullaby.\nThe bands aforementioned art-house pedigree goes a long way toward making You Forgot It In People more than just another fantastic pop record: One of its foremost traits is its airy spaciousness. On many of its tracks, the sounds seem to resonate indefinitely, as if played at top volume on a Greenland hillside and recorded miles away. Simultaneously, the album is dense with the baroque instrumentation of all fifteen players, each part beautifully arranged, and all of them bleeding together in perfect harmonic unison. Chalk one up for heretofore unknown producer David Newfeld, who isolates the songs key instruments upfront in the mix, and captures all others as delicate nuances-- an expansive, pillowy bed of ethereal violins, muted trumpets and flutes to softly support the traditional guitars, bass and drums.\nRock critic Michael Goldberg recently speculated that what makes music fanatics thirst for the obscure is the desire to discover music that is \"uncontaminated by the commerce machine.\" This, he says, is the reason we cling to the abstract and unmarketable, the outlandish and abrasive. And yet, this is also the guy whose favorite album of last year was the painfully vacuous adult-contempo masterflop by Beth Gibbons \u0026 Rustin Man. Granted, not all of us share Goldbergs taste for sub-folk cheddar, but theres something like that record in each of our collections. So, how can there be room for both challenging, forward-thinking music and straight-up accessibility?\nWell, were not total fucking assholes, right? We can kick back with Ekkehard Ehlers or Electric Light Orchestra-- theres inherent greatness in both. But the holy grail for people like us is the record that combines outright experimentation and strong hooks, something that engages us mentally while appealing to the instincts that draw us toward pop immediacy. Some of the best records ever have been ones that put these two seemingly disparate elements together-- and you can go as recent as The Notwists Neon Golden or as far back as Sgt. Peppers (and probably farther, if you want). This kind of music shouldnt be hard to come by; its just that not many artists are able to perfect that balance.\nBroken Social Scene have, and even made it seem effortless. I wish I could convey to you just how perfectly this record pulls off that balancing act, how incredibly catchy and hummable these songs are, despite their refusal to resort to pandering or oversimplicity. I wish I could convey how theyve made just exactly the kind of pop record that stands the test of time, and how its ill-advised packaging and shudder-inducing bandname seem so infinitesimal after immersing yourself in the music. And I hate to end this saying, \"You just have to hear it for yourself.\" But oh my god, you do. You just really, really do.",

        "article_text": "Craig Finn isnt a singer. His voice is a harsh, nasal, confused, emphatic bleat, clamping down on certain words and rolling tricky internal rhymes around in his mouth until they come out all broken. He sounds more like the sketchy drunk guy yelling in your ear at a show, asking if you know where to buy drugs, than like the frontman of the band onstage. Finns voice may be difficult, but dont let it be a deal-breaker.\nFinn may not be Art Garfunkel up in this piece, but he uses his adenoidal rasp to blurt twisted, dense shards of squalid back-alley imagery and bruised druggy lamentations, broken teeth and broken bottles, and tattered hotel-room Bibles and hidden knives. Hes the poet laureate of the loading dock behind the mall where the runaway kids get together to sniff cheap coke at 5 a.m.\nThe Hold Steadys first album, last years ...Almost Killed Me, was a tangled mess of damaged character sketches and triumphant bar-rock thump-- Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle reimagined as an epic of Russian literature. But Separation Sunday is something more, the elegiac Biblical lost-innocence junkie odyssey that Denis Johnson never wrote.\nLike Fiestas \u0026 Fiascos, the final album from Finns former Minneapolis post-punk band Lifter Puller, its an album-length story that forces us to pull bits of narrative from Finns tangles of words. In Separation Sunday, a confused Catholic girl named Hallelujah hooks up with a motley assortment of shady characters, does a gang of drugs, gets born again when some guy with a nitrous tank dunks her in a river, wakes up in a confession booth, and maybe dies and maybe comes back from death. But the real story is in Finns virtuoso evocations of menace (\"When they say great white sharks/ They mean the kind in big black cars/ When they say killer whales/ They mean they whaled on him till they killed him up in Penetration Park\"), hedonism (\"You came into the ER drinking gin from a jam jar/ And the nurse is making jokes about the ER being like an after-bar\"), and brief shining moments of lucidity (\"Youth services always find a way to get their bloody cross into your druggy little messed-up teenage life\").\nNone of this would work if Finn didnt have an expert rock band backing him up. Finns songs wheel precariously from one unhinged lyrical idea to the next, almost never stopping for choruses or going out of their way to fit into any sort of structure, but the band plays these songs like long-lost fist-in-the-air classic rock anthems. Its well-schooled in every bar-rock cliché, and executes these moves with joy and conviction: the pick-slide before the climax, the weeping Hammond organ on the bridge, the pregnant pause before the big riff kicks back in. Since ...Almost Killed Me, the band has beefed up its sound with the help of Rocket From the Crypt producer Dave Gardner and keyboard player Franz Nickolay, and its Meat Loaf pianos, greasy George Thorogood blooz choogle, and wheedling Journey guitar carry more heft and authority than they had on the last album. This stuff would sound great behind just about any garage-rock hack, but it turns Finns dirtbag chronicles into something epic and huge and molten and beautiful.\n ",

        "article_text": "College Dropout Mini-Course Syllabus\nWeek 1: Allow Myself to Introduce Myself. Backstory. Discuss humble beginnings making beats in bedroom, car accident in October 2002 that nearly killed him. Consider rise to fame: Currently has three singles in the Top 20 (\"Slow Jamz\", \"You Dont Know My Name\", \"Through the Wire\") bearing his name. Compare/contrast rise of hip-hop artist/producers with singer/songwriter movement of 1970s; Is Kanye West Neil Young or Neil Diamond?\nWeek 2: Chitown, Whats Going On? Discuss the failure of Chicago to produce a bona fide hip-hop star despite possessing more than enough fertile neighborhoods of racial segregation and socioeconomic difficulty. Uncover reasons why Common and West needed to move NYC-wards to attain widespread success.\nWeek 3: First Nigga with a Benz and a Backpack. Analyze the fast-disappearing line between mainstream and underground hip-hop, as personified by College Dropouts guest appearances, and Wests personal rap style. Compare/contrast to analogous rock divisions, in regards to how rock collaborations of similar caliber (Nickelback ft. Xiu Xiu?) would be greeted with indignant horror by fans.\nWeek 4: School Spirit. Engage the anti-education themes of College Dropouts songs and skits, discussing why this particular message is greatly emphasized by West. Acknowledge the groaner irony of discussing an albums anti-intellectualism in syllabus form.\nSo many extracurricular angles, so little time; so lets just suffice it to say that College Dropout is the first great hip-hop album of the still pre-pubescent 2004. Runner-up in its first week on the Billboard album charts only to Ravi Shankars jazz-waif kid, the record is poised to be a huge coming-out party for one of the top producers working today, possibly even winning him the Outkast Triple Crown of acceptance from pop radio, hip-hop purists, and reactionary rock critics. Frequently delayed, retooled, overdubbed, teased on the mixtape circuit, overloaded with skits and guest stars, and dispersed in multiple misleading forms over the Internet, the retail version finally takes the form of a flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album.\nIn a way, its strange that West would be the first of the current producer bumper crop to find such success with his own name on the spine, with The Neptunes and Timbaland having colonized the charttops for a much longer period of time, and with much more adventurous and characteristic sounds. Wests style is far less future-vision, as he typically reworks old records with the playfulness of a kid enthralled by playing 33s at 45. You can write it off as a safer or less original approach, but the sugar-high soul technique tends to be an addictive substance in Wests hands, as anyone whos had the hook from \"H to the Izzo\" stuck in their head for a week or eight can attest.\nBut Kanyes success through the studio glass is more drawn from his surprising abilities as an MC: He possesses a sizable amount of his Rocafella boss charisma while hiding his occasional technical shortcomings with his gift for comedic timing. Mixtape downloaders have known this for a while, thanks to his whip-smart verses on \"Heavy Hitters\" and \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\", but College Dropout brings a new evidence file, whether hes probing creative tax accounting on \"We Dont Care\" or puncturing the air bag of designer materialism in \"All Fall Down\". And when words fail, Kanye can always fall back on his day job, camouflaging even less-inspired lyrical moments with affably absurd beat constructions like the vocoder/strings/handclaps amalgamation that carries \"The New Workout Plan\" past its lyrical juvenilia.\nOne begins to wish there were even more examples of Kanyes mic-work, as the album is also laden with distracting guest appearance speed-bumps-- spots that safety-net the albums bottom line but dilute the spotlight on its lead performer. Strangely, the biggest names fare the worst, with Jay-Z already sounding groggy from retirement on \"Never Let Me Down\" and Ludacris sounding groggy from something less legal on the hook to \"Breathe In Breathe Out\". The small names of Kanyes Chicago crew fail to impress as well, with GLC and Consequences laconic verses deflating the menace of working-class lament \"Spaceship\".\nAs a result, the mid-level MCs steer around the flank to steal the show, particularly on the quietly tense \"Get Em High\" where Kanye coaxes Talib Kweli into lightening up and fellow Southsider Common into getting serious. Chart-topper \"Slow Jamz\" appears in a slightly longer (and slightly weaker) form featuring overkill Jamie Foxx and depleted Twista, but if you havent reached your quota yet, it remains the best getting-it-on song ever written about getting-it-on songs. The ferocious \"Two Words\" up-ramps a Mandrill sample into an ominous choir and violin-fed war cry flexibly savage enough to allow Mos Def to spit about his politics, Kanye about his Grammys, and Freeway about Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Steven Seagal.\nThat \"Two Words\" is sequestered (along with the chock-full-of-clever \"Through the Wire\") behind a painful stretch of three clunker skits in four tracks (with the song island, \"School Spirit\", one of the albums weakest) shows that Kanye hasnt quite soaked in the lesson of the Jay-Z album that made his reputation: less skits = longer shelf life. Fortunately, listeners can take the editing into their own hands in this age of the iPod, also axing the once-interesting, twice-tiresome biography speech that fills out the 12-minute \"Last Call\". Deleting the skits also cuts down on the strange logic of the albums anti-college stance-- someone should tell West that not everyone on the street has the ability and/or luck to make a living in the music biz. (Full disclosure: Your reviewer may be biased by the fact that hell probably be spending his lifetime in the Ivory Tower.)\nBloated tracklist, guest star overload, lyrical paradoxes: It all might sound a bit critical for an 8+ album, but College Dropouts flaws tend to only help make Kanye West all the more personable as an artist. With the fat playlist trimmed, the album lays down a sky-high standard for hip-hop challengers in 04, featuring enough singles in reserve to fill out the calendar year. Ideal weather conditions of Chicagos rap void, producer name-dropping, and mainstream/underground bleedover may have handled the advance work for Kanye Wests arrival, but College Dropout doesnt muff the kick.\n ",

        "article_text": "Ever since the release of their 2002 debut Knife Play, Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart has been hard at work redefining the concept of \"challenging\" music. Rather than obfuscating songs with grating noise and ostensibly atypical structures, Stewart challenges the most fundamental conventions of musical expression and honesty with an intensity thats often been misread as parody, irony or cheap theatrics. Thus, while Xiu Xius music has continued to gain support in recent years, its rare to hear a recommendation that isnt qualified with some sort of hesitant apology for the bands atypical instrumentation and over-the-top delivery.\nWell, all that can end right now. After showing tremendous musical growth on last years A Promise, Stewart has come frighteningly close to producing his masterwork-- an album thats as accessible as it is unconventionally affecting. On Fabulous Muscles, Stewart plays with dissonance without succumbing to it, contorting electronic drones, drum machine beats and his own haunting tenor into a propulsive and elegant record. The songs are often tremendously dense, but the combinations and contrast Stewart teases out of the mix are always immediate and striking. Indeed, the quality of the melodic and instrumental interplay here is right up there with many more straightforward pop bands, but Stewart manages to use it to an entirely different end. Detached from the safety and set form of traditional pop music, Fabulous Muscles is an album bursting with tension, tenderness, pain, and restraint-- concepts that have informed Xiu Xius music from the beginning, but which the band has never so deftly expressed.\n\"Crank Heart\" immediately establishes Fabulous Muscles as both accessible and deeply layered. Perfectly balancing melody, energy and chaos, the song sounds as if its ready to blow apart at any minute, held together only by a hauntingly present force of will. The tension increases on the albums title track, which appeared last year on a split EP with the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up. This new version foregoes the spooky atmospherics and whirring spaceship sounds of the EP version in lieu of a chilling, almost self-punishing restraint.\nThis restraint is often shaken by an underlying intensity, best conveyed on \"I Luv the Valley OH!\", quite possibly the finest single track Xiu Xiu has ever released. \"I Luv the Valley OH!\" is an immediately accessible song, but also a profoundly subversive one. Mimicking traditional pop forms while simultaneously defiling them, the intrinsic discomfort of \"I Luv the Valley OH!\" comes through in both its structure and its articulation. The songs titular scream provides the frozen emotional centerpiece for a feverish and insistent dirge, and a rare moment of absolute release amidst an album often marked by a chilling sense of emotional confinement.\nOnly once does Fabulous Muscles threaten to descend into absolute cacophony. On the harrowing \"Support Our Troops (Black Angels OH!)\", Stewart tackles politics with characteristic intensity. Rather than hiding behind tried-and-true anti-war sloganeering, Stewart delves into the troubling psychology of war. Whether or not the sentiments expressed here are \"correct\" is entirely moot-- whats striking about the song is not so much its direct political implications, but the overwhelming and sincere sense of human terror that permeates it.\nPart of what makes this record so powerful, though, is the fact that this darkness often lifts. On \"Clowne Towne\", Stewart sings, \"Your true self has become weak, alone, and annoying/ A true ridiculous dumbass,\" in an oddly sweet combination of fondness and frustration that fits perfectly into a disarmingly catchy song. \"Little Panda McElroy\", which first appeared on the same split EP as \"Fabulous Muscles\", remains one of the most poignant and complicated love songs Ive ever heard. With lyrics like, \"I can stop wanting to kill myself.../ Because of you,\" this is about as far from your typical, rote and sterile love song as you can get. This version offers an even more moving musical exploration, as Stewarts breathy voice is subsumed by pulsing electronic drones into a single, insistent beat.\nThough there are many notable high points to Fabulous Muscles, its overwhelming consistency is what cements its place as Xiu Xius finest. The album does not contain a single hiccup or yawn-- no extraneous noise, no potentially offputting histrionics, no throwaways and no dull moments. Fabulous Muscles, like the best of Xiu Xius catalog, is challenging not because its particularly dissonant or noisy, but rather because it addresses you in a manner thats categorically different from what youve come to expect from any kind of music-- pop, experimental or otherwise. With Fabulous Muscles, Jamie Stewart continues to explore and expand this mode of address, and in doing so has made an album that is profound, innovative, and absolutely vital.\n ",

        "article_text": "There was a David and Goliath quality to the simultaneous performances that closed out the 2009 Pitchfork Music Festival. Against the Flaming Lips grid-draining light show and extravagant confetti budget, the Very Best pitted a grinning guy in a rakishly cocked plaid hat, a stocky Euro-hipster with a console-laden table, and a couple of head-wrapped backup singers. The crowd seemed thin and politely engaged during the first song. By the last, the audience had swelled considerably, and everyone was bouncing up and down-- a sea of genuinely happy faces. Thats the simplest and most important thing about the Very Best. Their enthusiasm is contagious.\nThe group debuted last year with the superlative mixtape Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit Are the Very Best. The Malawi-born singer ran a secondhand shop in London, where he met Etienne Tron of Radioclit (Tron is French; his partner Johan Karlberg is Swedish). Radioclits prior work had leaned heavily on grime, Miami bass, crunk, and other aggressive genres; they dubbed their style \"ghetto-pop.\" But with the Very Best mixtape, they turned from dark, druggy hedonism to effervescent productions that blended Afropop-laced originals with mixes of M.I.A. and Vampire Weekend. It was feel-good music that felt fresh and healthful, just like Mwamwayas voice. He sang ebulliently in Chichewa, English, and other languages, and the foreignness of the words only cleared the way for the life-affirming feeling that shined through them.\nWarm Heart of Africa, the groups official debut, rises to the high standard set by the mixtape, from which only two tracks are held over: \"Kamphopo\", where Mwamwaya swaggers through sun-streaked Architecture in Helsinki samples, and a dance mix of \"Kada Manja\", with added drums and some of its strings gathered up into a loping rhythm. A couple of guest stars also return. Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend duets with Mwamwaya on the title track, which will probably be the first song on the album that knocks out most listeners. \"The boys move fast/ You should take it slow,\" they advise coquettishly, in an irresistible hopscotch cadence, over splashes of sampled guitar and hand percussion. And M.I.A. appears on \"Rain Dance\", panting and purring over a taut drumline, in one of the albums few respites from blaring melody. This sense of continuity with the mixtape is bolstered by the fact that some of these songs are so immediate youll swear youve heard them before, like \"Julia\", which sounds like some kind of sublimely cheerful G-funk.\nRadioclit deserve a lot of credit for keeping the vibe upbeat but diverse: Whether theyre cooking up a snap track with pizzicato accents on \"Yalira\", pinging 1980s synth-pop on \"Chalo\", tropical dreams on \"Angonde\", or kwaito-inspired pulses on \"Ntdende Uli\", they stay out of Mwamwayas way, using small and tactile rhythmic embellishments to give him extra kick-- always lively, never cluttered. Which is smart, because Mwamwaya is a scene-stealer, for the uncomplicated reason that he sings like an angel and takes evident pleasure in doing so. On \"Zamdziko\", his voice weaves in and out of itself, adorned only with sporadic drum claps. For Mwamwaya, a hot beat is always nice, but pretty much optional. The albums biggest asset has to do with his presence, and its hard to put a name to-- \"spiritual generosity\" sounds too grand, but thats what it feels like.\nSome people tend to get up in arms whenever African music gets mixed up with Western genres-- as if they havent always been in a dialogue, like how marabi is related to American jazz. The Very Best inspired me to learn more about some of the genres they employ, and if you do the same, thats great-- but an Afropop primer isnt what Mwamwayas about here. In drawing lines between older African genres, like highlife, and newer ones, like kwaito, and then linking those to international pop styles of various eras, Warm Heart of Africa pictures a glittering web of connectivity where national and cultural boundaries dissolve. People care about socio-cultural chin-stroking; music does not. This record simply wants to be heard, by whomever will listen and enjoy. Theres no cynical play for authenticity, no implication that Afropop is somehow piously cordoned off from Western music. Its a true global-pop album, and a hopeful template for things to come.",

        "article_text": "In January, Portishead founder Geoff Barrow took to Twitter to snip at James Blake. \"Will this decade be remembered as the Dubstep meets pub singer years?\" he asked, not naming the 22-year-old producer who, only that morning, was highlighted in the BBCs Sound of 2011 poll. When dubstep boomed and shuddered from Croydon at the dawn of the last decade, Blake wasnt yet a teenager. Barrow, on the other hand, was almost 40 and already on hiatus from one of the previous decades most influential bands. Hed heard the rise of dubstep-- its cavernous bass, quick-click rhythms, bent vocal hooks-- and the tall, plaid-wearing kid from Enfield must have sounded a lot like its populist fall.\nBarrows dismissal of Blake is, presumably, a defense of dubstep-- the gesture suggests a purist, an elitist, or both. Reconsidered from the other artistic end, however, the implication is that maybe this is the decade where singer-songwriters-- longtime wastrels of pianos and six-strings with three chords-- finally get interesting, manipulating their pretty little voices and best love songs for something more than plain ballads and pleas. In that case, Barrow is right about Blakes full-length debut. Composed of tender torch songs, elegiac drifters, and soulful melodies, Blakes first puts him in the rare company of fellow singers-- Thom Yorke, Karin Dreijer, Antony Hegarty, Justin Vernon, Dan Bejar-- whove recently bent their own lavish voices, not samples, to make interesting pop music shaped with electronics. These songs are bigger than the defense of any microgenre, and, chances are, theyll soon make Blake a star. He deserves it.\nDubstep producer Untold released \"Air and Lack Thereof\", Blakes first single, on his Hemlock label in 2009; it was solid, slightly spooky dubstep, with drums darting around a sample that kept eroding. Since that debut, though, Blake has slowly focused on crafting songs-- bona fide, three-to-four minute builders-- around hooks. Last years \"CMYK\", for instance, spliced Blakes voice with cuts from American R\u0026B to place an indelible hook inside a number that actually progressed through its four minutes. Blakes more recent Klavierwerke EP draped its dance floor intentions around his own sweetly sung voice. And now, he moves still further from abstraction, to verses and even an occasional chorus.\nWhile the songs are the magnetic center here, Blakes musicianship and sonics are equally striking. A \"dubstep\" producer with a gentle piano touch and an ear for granular synthesis so sharp it will make fleets of laptop toters envious, his toolkit is seamless. The two-part \"Why Dont You Call Me\" / \"I Mind\", for instance, opens with only voice and piano, played with the studied delicacy of a classical student. But Blake cuts it short 30 seconds in by splicing and resampling the piano line. He then bends his own voice and sings the lone verse twice, editing and re-shaping it into a new form that bears only the faintest resemblence to its opening source material. In the suites second half, the vocals become spinning smears that fall into the background. Its the only time on the album where the drum clicks, static bursts, and piano splashes become the essential motion. Its the type of track you might have heard on one of his recent EPs-- the kind Blake purists lament this albums supposed lack of.\nWith this new LP-- released on a major label on both sides of the Atlantic, no less-- odds are, a lot of people are going to listen, and I dont mean in the tail-eating, blog-bite-blog sort of way. \"Lindisfarne II\" takes what Bon Ivers For Emma, Forever Ago did best and turns it into a simple, poignant mantra; if it doesnt score the seasons end of some prime-time drama, a music director should be fired. The same goes for the album-ending \"Measurements\", which somehow pulls the sound of a Southern black gospel choir from Blakes laptop and white-boy coo. Feist cover \"Limit to Your Love\" works in just enough of dubsteps bass flutter and snare snap. If Blake really does cross over and become the pretty white male who introduces a broader audience to dubstep, with its foundations in Jamaican music and black musicians in South East London, hell receive the tired, requisite backlash. But these 11 songs-- gorgeous, indelible tunes that are as generous in content as they are restrained in delivery-- will last a lot longer.",

        "article_text": "Talking to us over the summer about his then-forthcoming album, Steven Ellison said he felt like he was progressing as a producer. \"Im finally getting to the point where I can make the kind of records... that I wanted to make when I was younger, things that I dreamed about making,\" he told us. That sounds modest-- hes been persistently pursuing a singular vision for years now-- but his first two albums did share common traits with his forebears. Even the excellent Los Angeles from 2008 took some of its cues from J Dilla, one of Ellisons idols. But with Cosmogramma, its not enough anymore to talk about Ellisons sound as \"post-Dilla\" or even \"post hip-hop.\" Its his sound now.\nIndeed, Cosmogramma is an intricate, challenging record that fuses his loves-- jazz, hip-hop, videogame sounds, IDM-- into something unique. Its an album in the truest sense. Even on Los Angeles, which hung together well as a full-length, there were moments you could pick out as singles or highlights-- the distorted pop of \"Camel\" or the maniacal electro-house of \"Parisian Goldfish\". But Cosmogramma is conceived as a movement-- bits of one song spill into the next, and its individual tracks make the most sense in the context of what surrounds them. In this sense, it feels almost like an avant-garde jazz piece, and so it takes more than a few listens to sink in-- one or two spins and youre still at the tip of the iceberg.\nJazz is a big influence on the record, and its a good place to start talking about the individual sections that make up the whole. Ellison is, of course, the nephew of jazz great Alice Coltrane and has said in interviews that his albums are in part dedicated to her. Thats clear on Cosmogramma, as there are distinct passages that pursue an elaborate kind of digital jazz and the album is constructed to move through different sections, as one of Coltranes might. There are roughly three of these passages-- the first is an aggressive three-song suite based loosely on videogame sounds. On \"Nose Art\", FlyLo puts raygun squiggles alongside woozy synths, grinding mechanical noises, and about 10 other sonic elements. Like much of the album, it sounds almost frustratingly unstable until you hear it a few times and the pieces begin to interlock and congeal.\nTrue to its title, Cosmogramma then moves through a heady astral stretch and finally a more downtempo jazz-heavy period. The latter partly serves as a necessary breather from the complicated sounds earlier on. FlyLo shows ridiculous talent in each section-- the things he can do with and to beats just arent common. In \"Zodiac Shit\", he makes a heavy, loping bass thump sputter out on cue, creating a physical rumbling quality. The beat of \"Computer Face // Pure Being\" trips over itself again and again like clothes tumbling in a dryer. These arent just tricks-- in each case they push the song toward a groove. And its not just beats: \"Satelllliiiiiiite\" is as dreamy as anything FlyLos done to date, its distorted vocal samples and steam-building arrangement not unlike something out of Burials repertoire and frankly just as good.\nThe song that will likely get the most attention here is \"...And the World Laughs With You\", a collaboration with Thom Yorke. Obviously an electronic-music fan, Yorke has done these guest spots before (for Modeselektor and others) and with such a high-profile contributor its easy to make the song all about him. But FlyLo doesnt pay Yorke any undue deference, just treats his vocals like another element to manipulate and weave into the mix. Its so subtle, in fact, that if youre not paying close attention you might miss his appearance altogether. Its this level of confidence and commitment to his vision that ultimately makes Cosmogramma so fascinating. FlyLo is working at the height of his creative powers right now, and the scary thing is its reasonable to think he could get better.",

        "article_text": "Steven Ellison called his breakthrough album as Flying Lotus Los Angeles, and his music still has a strong metaphorical connection to the city. Hes an admirer of producers like Dr. Dre, but Ellisons vision mixes the pulse of contemporary urban life with an extra dose of sci-fi futurism. He has his ear to the ground in terms of whats happening now and whats real, but his mind is fixated on what might happen tomorrow-- part Boyz n the Hood, part Blade Runner. And since Ellisons musical palette always circles back to the Eastern-tinged textures that infiltrated jazz when his great aunt Alice Coltrane was helping set the pace (assorted bells, harp plucks, the pings of steel and knock of wood), his music feels cosmic, bound to L.A. as a geographic idea but not necessarily of this earth.\nIn the last five years, Flying Lotus has become a standard-bearer for 21st-century beat construction by looking forward and backward simultaneously and making music that feels like an exploration. So what happens when such an artist reaches a cul-de-sac? After Flying Lotus 2010 landmark Cosmogramma, further density was not an option. That album was packed so tightly with rhythms, instruments, and textures that adding more to the mix would have meant risking identity; just a few more samples could have turned the music into an indistinct mush that contains every color at once. Cosmogramma felt like an end game, and the new Flying Lotus album, Until the Quiet Comes, finds Ellison lighting out in a new direction. Hes thinking in terms of air, mood, and simplicity. In an interview with the UK magazine The Wire, Ellison described Quiet as his attempt at \"a childrens record, a record for kids to dream to.\" While theres nothing cute or naive on the album, you get a sense of what Ellison might mean when it comes to dreaming. \u2028\nThe albums opening section, including \"Until the Colours Come\", \"Heave(n)\", and \"All In\", functions as a sort of miniature suite of downtempo jazz. This is Flying Lotus at its most vibe-heavy and mystical, where rooms are thick with purple incense and its always 3 a.m. The sound is not new-- tracks like these were a cornerstone of 1990s trip-hop of the Headz comp/Ninja Tune variety-- but the sheer beauty of Ellisons design sets his music apart. This is a quality he shares with the very different Ricardo Villalobos: By pulling back and giving his meticulously-constructed elements room to breathe, Ellison allows us to hear them as if for the first time. \"Tiny Tortures\" begins with a rhythm thats all bones-- a simulated wood block, snare, and hissy cymbal tracing out an off-kilter beat. Against this backdrop the bass guitar of Stephen \"Thundercat\" Bruner enters, and the contrast between his gliding, harmonically rich runs and the spare opening is breathtaking. Thundercats expressive bass work also adds character to the comparatively thick title track, as a gong and handclaps flow continuously like water over rocks while an unstable Dilla-fied keyboard wedges in between the beats. But even here, when theres more going on, the ear can fixate on any one sound and extract feeling from it.\nAs the album progresses, it changes in feel, but the shifts are organic. If the tracks in the opening section bring to mind an abstraction of spaced-out jazz, elsewhere Ellision conjures the blocky colors of videos games. See the thick 8-bit synths in \"Sultans Request\", the curlicue melody in \"Putty Boy Strut\", the simple refrain of the title track, which makes me think of a digital hero on a quest. These lighter moments are careful and reserved. You can feel Ellison putting a smaller frame around each individual part.\nThe hushed world Ellison has constructed here is hermetic and internally focused, even for him, and the albums guests dont break the spell. The featured players meet Ellison on his turf and adapt to the landscape of the record. Erykah Badus connection to Flying Lotus broader aesthetic is readily apparent, as her sense of mystical earthiness is grounded in tradition but free to wander outside of it. On \"See Thru to U\", she does away with soul singing in its formal sense and allows herself to become an instrument. The result is a satisfying melding of creative personalities but it wouldnt work on an Erykah Badu album-- its too vaporous, too unconcerned with personality. The same goes for Thom Yorkes contribution on \"Electric Candyman\"; Ellison turns him into a ghost, which makes perfect sense.\nFollowing the shattering Cosmogramma, Until the Quiet Comes is disarming at first. It sometimes feels like an experiment in how much can be stripped away while still sounding like Flying Lotus, but the reduction offers a new perspective into what Ellison is about. Los Angeles and Cosmogramma brought to mind the L.A. that thrives on acceleration. The energy here is just as strong, but its concentrated into a smaller space. So while this might be Flying Lotus most accessible record, its less about being pleasant and more about deep focus. Each of these 18 tracks tends to introduce one or two emotional or musical elements and meditate on them for a brief time before easing back into silence. Quiet is a series of suggestions or clues and it always feels just out of reach, but that leaves a lot of room for the listener. The surface is a gorgeous invitation to return and see if you can figure out what it all means.",

        "article_text": "Every great rap group has one MC who is-- possibly unfairly-- perceived to be slightly lesser than the other. DMC. Parrish Smith. Malice. Pimp C, at least up until he died. Big Bois been on that list ever since André Benjamin started rocking pith helmets and neckerchiefs. Big Bois not underrated, exactly; everyone who knows rap knows hes a great rapper. Its more that hes taken for granted. Virtually every OutKast review of the past decade and a half has posited Big Boi as the earthy, street-level anchor to Andrés spaced-out visionary, the guy responsible for securing the groups cred when André was trying to invent new colors. Expect Sir Lucious Left Foot to change those conversations. We havent heard a major-label rap album this inventive, bizarre, joyous, and masterful in a long time, and its almost impossible to imagine André putting out a solo album this strong anytime soon.\nAt this point, Big Boi has every right to indulge in the bitter-old-man invective thats tempted so many other rappers of his generation. Even though hes half of one of the most successful groups ever, Big Boi has had to go through years of release-date delays and label drama (some of the topical lyrics here sound like they were written years ago), until he finally left longtime home Jive just so he could release a damn solo album already. Label machinations kept Andrés voice from even appearing on Sir Lucious Left Foot-- heartbreaking when you think about Andrés jaw-dropping display on the early advance single \"Royal Flush\". But instead of letting these setbacks infect his music, Big Bois made an album that explodes with ideas at every turn, that glides and twitches and mutates with delirious urgency.\nMusically, the album drips with 1980s synth-funk signifiers. The keyboards glimmer as they roam, and talkboxes mutter and blurt. But these tracks arent the stoned miasmas that someone like Dâm-Funk cranks out. Instead, theyre itchy and fleet-footed. New melodic elements flit in and out of tracks just as you start to notice them, and theres a lot going on at any given moment. Consider, for example, album closer \"Back Up Plan\". The track, from old comrades Organized Noize, finds room for cheerleader chants, disembodied grunts, a weird little synth whistle, processed funk guitar, orchestra hits, frantic scratching, a lowdown wobbling bassline, and probably some other stuff that Im missing-- and this is one of the most laid-back songs on the entire album.\nEvery once in a while, well get a nod toward some current trend, but these arent market capitulations; theyre more opportunities to play with what the kids are doing now. \"Follow Us\", for example, has a generic rock-dude chorus from Vonnegutt, and virtually any other rapper wouldve built a hackneyed half-rock song out of a chorus like that, but producer Salaam Remi instead piles bubbly synthetic melodies all over each other. And the robo-voices on \"Shutterbugg\" arent airy Auto-Tune; theyre more of a deep rumble that you can feel in your gut. \"Tangerine\" somehow simultaneously sounds like strip-club ass-shake material and Funkadelic covering Morricone. Looking at the production credits, its surprising to see names like Scott Storch and Lil Jon-- hitmakers who dont really make hits anymore, and who havent been all that interesting in a while. So Big Boi, then, is someone who encourages his collaborators furthest-out ideas, and who knows what to do with those ideas when he gets them.\nAs a rapper, Big Boi is something else. He just does so many things with his voice and cadence, letting his words fall over the snares one moment and fighting upstream against the beat the next. He never falls into any particular pattern of delivery, instead using his flow to knock beats back and forth with relish. Sixteen years after the first OutKast album, hes still coming up with dizzy combinations of words: \"My recitals are vital and maybe needed for survival,\" \"The slickness that get your chick hit quick,\" \"Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on a smash/ When your ass cross paths with this half of the Kast.\" Even if he were saying nothing, the tumble of his words is a thing to behold.\nBut then, hes never saying nothing. Sir Lucious Left Foot is an album blissfully free of both old-man hectoring and drug-rap nihilism. A few times Big Boi brings up the idea that its really not too smart to rap about selling crack all the time, but he doesnt dwell on it, and he confines most of his skepticism to awesomely worded asides (\"Snow? Thats for toboggans.\") Hes hard enough to tell you to get the Souths dick up out your motherfucking mouth and draw blood with the command, but hes also clever enough to slide away from threats just as quickly. He spends a large chunk of the album talking about sex, sounding like a fired-up 11-year-old goofing off in the back of some sort of prodigy-level English class.\nTheres a lot more to like about Sir Lucious Left Foot. Some of the skits are actually pretty funny. The guests-- who range from masterful fast-rap newcomer Yelawolf to a stirringly gritty Jamie Foxx-- all turn in top-shelf performances. Old Dungeon Family associates Big Rube and Khujo Goodie make feel-good cameos that actually contribute to their songs. But the real story is the rap veteran whos done everything he could possibly do in the genre but who still finds new ways to have fun with it. Last years best rap album came from Raekwon, another wily old vet who hit a serious late-career stride. But Raekwon did it by inhabiting his older styles, making a record that couldve conceivably come out in 1996. On Sir Lucious Left Foot, Big Boi does something even more difficult: He gives us a great album that sounds nothing like any of the great albums hes already given us. From where Im sitting, thats an even greater achievement.",

        "article_text": "No one ever wants to admit that summers totally over, but its even tougher this year considering how fun it all was-- seems like every other day, an evocatively named band would come about and contribute to this glo-fi/dreambeat/chillwave thing that was perfect for those unbearably humid August nights rife with possibility, imagining an alternate universe where the narcotic of choice in danceclubs were Galaxie 500 and Saint Etienne records.\nMore than a few of these singles came from Philadelphias Dayve Hawk in the guise of either Memory Cassette, Weird Tapes, or Memory Tapes. To this point, hed served as something of a microcosm for this sound, which has created intriguingly hazy, wistful but beat-informed one-offs and EPs, but nothing weighty enough to get it past \"something we did that one summer,\" as if it were a road trip or ill-fated romance recalled years later. That was before Seek Magic, a record of achingly gorgeous dance-pop that captures both the joy of nostalgia and the melancholic sense that were grasping for good times increasingly out of reach.\nInitially, Seek Magics power derives from an intensely personalized ability to unlock hidden chambers in our memory banks. The half-submerged guitars that introduce \"Swimming Field\" suggest this is as a soundtrack for a restless evening, but between its F-G chord progression and aqueous thumb-piano and panflute synths, Im reminded of scorching July days vibing out to Wilcos A Ghost Is Born. Instrumental breaks \"Pink Stones\" and \"Run Out\" recall the unconventional beauty of Apehx Twins Richard D. James Album. \"Green Knight\" smacks of Polices \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" in its verse and any number of mid-80s light funk with its guitar licks, the sneaker squeak in the instrumental break is one of the most evocative found sounds Ive heard in a while.\nSeek Magic is something of an inhabitable universe that proves theres far more to Hawks sound than a way with reverb and passing familiarity with dance loops. The rubber-smacks-road beat of \"Bicycle\" would be content to mirror its titular vehicle, but nearly every minute packs some sort of detailed compositional surprise: the widescreen breakthrough where Hawks androgynous vocals shake lo-fi two minutes in, the bass breakdown that soon rights itself into the second halfs backbone, and the choral coda that lays a euphoric vocal sigh over wave-running New Order guitars. By comparison, \"Plain Material\" is streamlined, but not by much-- the way Hawks voice hits the fuzzed-out guitar chords, you might think this was an unearthed Flaming Lips track, and at first, it sounds like the first time on Seek Magic that hell adhere to a standard verse-chorus structure. It does, but only after a drum beat cribbed straight from Organized Noize turns in a bridge of teen screams imported from In Ghost Colours nastier breakdowns.\nAnd yet in Seek Magics centerpieces, you sense a nocturnal unease usually attributed to more spare albums. \"Stop Talking\" couldve been content to ride out its gummy bass riff to infinity, but it morphs through so many phases in its seven minutes that the half-time post-rock finale doesnt feel tacked-on. On the following song, \"Graphics\", Hawk offers an unnervingly lonely sentiment-- \"I dont even recognize the sound of your voice, the feel of your touch, you could be alone even though Im here by your side.\" Lyrics are mere suggestions through most of Seek Magic, but Hawk lays out an \"I cant go on, Ill go on\" vibe throughout. One second, he sighs \"this is the last time\" and immediately thereafter, \"one more time, baby, one more time.\" Its a sentiment thats underpinned great works of art from Daft Punk (\"One More Time\" natch), F. Scott Fitzgerald (This Side of Paradise), Kanye West (\"Why cant life always be this easy?\"), and um, Old Milwaukee-- the times where you think \"it doesnt get any better than this,\" and its simultaneously the happiest and saddest thing you can say.",

        "article_text": "Erika M. Anderson has talked about finding \"true bliss and terror\" in the live performances of her former band, Gowns. The pressure-cooker atmosphere she and her partner in that group (and in life) Ezra Buchla immersed themselves in had to crack at some point, and it did, fatally and finally, at the beginning of 2010. Andersons way of propping open an escape hatch from the bruised purging of Gowns was to retreat into herself, by gathering her collective musical ideas and putting them out under her own initials. But its immediately apparent on hearing Past Life Martyred Saints, her debut full-length as EMA, that shes still all tangled up in \"bliss and terror.\" For the most part, its a white-knuckle ride. Theres no pretense or pose here. No pulling back from the brink to foster an air of cool detachment. Andersons music has the power to plummet to the depths and drag you right down there with her.\nTheres a lack of timidity in the way this music is expressed. Its almost as though Anderson snoozed her way through the past decade and is picking up threads that have mostly lain dormant since the early-to-mid 1990s. The boldness in her language, which thematically pings back and forth between emotional and physical duress, has the same naked volatility as Kat Bjelland circa Spanking Machine or Courtney Love in her Pretty on the Inside phase. Its often terrifying, distressing stuff. Theres a feeling that youre watching someone in the midst of several life crises. Its a strange kind of testament to Past Life Martyred Saints that it often feels like a daunting proposition to listen to, as if spending too much time with it will leave you as scarred as its creator.\nThe lyrical fixations here frequently zoom in on Cronenberg-ian body horror, with Anderson exploring the gnarly elasticity of the human frame when its placed under threat. EMA songs often duck into little mantras; \"Butterfly Knife\" bears one of the most unnerving of those in its \"20 kisses with a butterfly knife\" line. \"Marked\" is similarly nauseating and obsessed with physical abuse. Over a noise that sounds like water chugging down rusty steel piping Anderson devolves into repeating: \"I wish that every time he touched me he left a mark.\" It dwells in the same kind of unsettling territory as Goffin/Kings \"He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss)\", and the bare-bones musical arrangement heightens the severity of the message just as Phil Spectors production did on the Crystals song.\nThat ability for her arrangements to acutely reflect her lyrical mood is one of Andersons trump cards. She knows exactly when to add and subtract elements, bringing \"Marked\" out of the doldrums at its close with a warm organ tone that she deploys whenever things get a little too heavy (see also: \"Milkman\"). The opening \"The Grey Ship\" is one of her most ambitious conceits in that regard. It shifts in style several times, from its earthy, folk-y opening to a midsection where all the instrumentation vanishes suddenly as if the bottom just fell out of the world.\nIts a sign of her confidence and ambition that she can open the record with such a multi-faceted song, full of odd diversions and unexpected twists that need multiple plays to really sink in. But the hit-rate here is high. \"California\" is among Andersons best works, a stream-of-consciousness rant about displacement and alienation set to a musical backing that feels like civilization collapsing around her. \"California\" shows off her enviable talent for finding a comfortable place where big-topic sloganeering and personal tales can coexist. Its that sweat-soaked head-rush of repulsion, sadness, anxiety, and nostalgia you get when you feel the tug of home.\nPast Life Martyred Saints is a fiercely individual record, made by a musician with a fearless and courageous approach to her art. Crucially, the desire to let such raw emotion out in song never feels forced. It simply wouldnt work this well if there was a hint of artifice, or a suggestion that Anderson hadnt regurgitated all these feelings of loss, loathing, and rejection from a pit of genuinely volatile emotion. Theres a conviction to her delivery that leaves you in no doubt that this is something she needed to flush out of her system. Comparisons can certainly be drawn to artists such as Patti Smith or Cat Power, and her dry, deadpan delivery occasionally orbits the same sphere as Kim Gordons vocal work with Sonic Youth. But this is Andersons own brittle unease. It hits as hard as a cold slap in the face-- and will leave its mark on you.",

        "article_text": "Girls frontman Christopher Owens grew up in the Children of God cult. His older brother died as a baby because the cult didnt believe in medical attention. His dad left. He and his mother lived around the world, and the cult sometimes forced his mother to prostitute herself. As a teenager, Owens fled and lived as a Texas gutter-punk for a while. Then a local millionaire took Owens under his wing, and Owens moved to San Francisco. There, he and Chet \"JR\" White formed Girls, and recorded Album, their debut album, under the influence of just about every kind of pill they could find.\nAs band origin stories go, this one is so epically sad and squalid and ultimately triumphant that nobody could make it up. Its the sort of story that can overwhelm a band so completely that you never really hear their music; you only hear the story. So its a tribute to Album that you dont need to know one word of that first paragraph to hear it as what it is: a dizzily powerful piece of work. Thats partly because you dont need to know Owens story to intuit that theres something going on here. When I saw the band play SXSW, knowing nothing about them beyond their compulsively listenable \"Hellhole Ratrace\" single, I wrote that the bands music sounds \"like the work of one deeply weird and possibly sad person.\"\nThats largely because of Owens enormously evocative voice, a hiccupy thing that feels like a direct descendant of every sad nerd genius in pop history. The immediate obvious reference point is Elvis Costello, but you can also hear shards of Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison and Paul McCartney and Morrissey. Owens never brays or moans or snarls; he sings simple songs about heartbreak with the internalized classicism of someone whos been listening to oldies radio in his sleep his whole life. Hes playful; he has fun with it. But theres always a wounded, raggedy quaver at the back of his throat, one that implies worlds of hurt beyond the simple breakup songs hes singing.\nAnd make no mistake; most of the songs on the Girls album are about, well, girls. Owens reportedly wrote much of the album in the aftermath of a bad breakup. Theres one song called \"Laura\" and another called \"Lauren Marie\", so hes presumably got someone in mind. But he never falls into emo laceration, instead delivering his sentiments with conversational directness: \"Youve been a bitch, Ive been an ass/ I dont wanna point the finger; I just know I dont like this, I dont wanna do this.\" But even his most innocuous classic-pop lyrics hint at a deep-seated fucked-upedness. On \"Goddamn\", he gets downright creepy over glimmering acoustic guitars and \"Ghost Town\" percussion-rattles: \"Just give all your attention to me.\" \"Headache\" is just as fragile and reverby, and Owens cops a half-joking lounge-singer baritone to sing, \"Lets be the people that we want to be/ Lets live like we could never part\"-- implying, of course, that hes not already the person he wants to be. And he starts out \"Hellhole Ratrace\", the bands first single, with this: \"Im sick and tired of the way that I feel.\" Hes a broken man.\nMusically, Album is mostly sunny Beach Boys pastiche, but its not the kajillionth indie attempt at orchestral Pet Sounds majesty. Rather, its simple and forthright early Beach Boys stuff: compact guitar-jangles, sha-la-la harmonies, muffled heartbeat drums. It sounds great. And even though it has a basic core sound, Album manages to cover a lot of aesthetic ground in its 44 minutes. Without being showy about it, they swing from rushing power-pop to acoustic campfire laments to \"Morning Light\", which is one of the most fully realized slices of shoegaze revivalism Ive heard in years. If theyd made an entire album of songs like \"Morning Light\", Girls would be getting a ton of blog love, but they decided to go for something at once messier and simpler. And theyre getting a ton of blog love anyway.\nTheres a pillowy quality to many of the sounds on Album, but this isnt lo-fi or glo-fi or whatever. Rather, every little production flourish is so much a part of the whole that you dont notice it until the 10th or 15th listen. On \"Lust for Life\", for instance, theres a melodica that bubbles up on the second half. \"Big Bad Mean Motherfucker\" is joyous beach-party stuff, but theres a beautifully discordant guitar solo in there. \"Hellhole Ratrace\" builds to an epic guitar whoosh halfway through its seven minutes, but the beats hammer never quite falls; the drums stay just slightly off. The guitars on \"Lauren Marie\" twang like Duane Eddys. All this stuff functions like the sleigh bells on Liz Phairs \"Fuck and Run\": subtle little intuitive details that you might never notice but that add to the devastating whole. The canniness of Albums production choices and the scuzzy depression of the lyrics and the gut-level songwriting instincts, along with everything else about the record, add up to something elusive and fascinating-- maybe even heartbreaking.",

        "article_text": "Doom is a broad category, one of those descriptors that needs an extra word like \"stoner,\" \"funeral,\" \"sludge,\" \"death,\" or \"drone\" to help narrow things down a little. It can bring to mind the slower, low-tuned psychedelic metal of post-Sabbath American groups like Saint Vitus, Trouble, and Pentagram along with Swedens Candlemass, UK act Cathedral, and descendants who are crustier (YOB, Asunder), more flatlining (Sunn O)))), seemingly suicidal (Loss), and exceedingly smoked-up (Sleep). Then come the backward-glancing modern traditionalists like weathered North Carolina crew Hour of 13, Rhode Island upstarts Pilgrim, and now, even more gloriously, Pallbearer.\nThe Little Rock, Ark., quartet sounds much older than its years on its fantastic debut LP, Sorrow and Extinction. The band released a three-song demo in 2010, but reach greater heights here, due to both sharper songwriting and better production. Really, even though they end their Sorrow thank-you list with a blushing \"and, of course, Black Sabbath,\" they go much deeper than that. You could throw in Saint Vitus and early Candlemass (1986s Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, especially), but it almost makes more sense to reference post-Sleep duo Om for the way each song insistently, specifically reaches for a focused transcendence. That said, theres more variation and catharsis here, despite the occasional Mick Barr/all-nighter riffing. It seems like a simple formula, and maybe it is, but the executions flawless. It also shifts subtly and continually: They mix in psychedelia, 1970s prog melodies, clean vocal harmonies, and ambient keyboards without sacrificing a certain smoked-up genre purity.\nWe get five songs in just under 50 minutes, each mountain of slow, majestic chords bleeding into one glorious cathedral of riffs and soaring vocals. Here is where their insistence on an overall flow pays off. The longest and best piece is the scene-setting opener, \"Foreigner\". It starts with tentative, pretty nylon-stringed acoustic guitars that, after two minutes, are joined by carefully played, delicate drums until everything crashes with a huge distorted crescendo. The riffs are beautiful and memorable, somehow both gentle and crushing, but the real key here is vocalist (and guitarist) Brett Campbell, who I first heard via his soaring (and surprising) guest spot on Loss beautifully bleak 2011 collection, Despond, an album that more usually features a guttural vocal gargle.\nThat contrast is an essential aspect of the band, which is why when we posted an \"An Offering of Grief\", I mentioned the Pallbearer featured \"[a] vocalist who sings.\" Campbell has been described as a young Ozzy Osbourne, and that influence is certainly there, but imagine if a young Ozzy had the ability to transform into Geddy Lee. This is music that would be interesting as instrumentals-- the guitars are that good-- but when you add a singer who can match that kind of dynamic surge, it goes somewhere else entirely. The songs have room to be extra patient in part because Pallbearer possess this weapon. On \"Given to the Grave\", for instance, we get more than five minutes of the acoustic strumming before the crunch and an ever-escalating Campbell. Theres no need to rush when the climaxes are that huge, and with his voice, theres always one new wrinkle on the horizon.\nThe clean, anthemic feel is reminiscent of 40 Watt Suns 2011 LP, The Inside Room. That band features vocalist and guitarist Patrick Walker of the 1990s UK doom group Warning taking five songs to just about 50 minutes, but with a more obviously introspective feel than we have here-- The Inside Rooms an apt title-- with moments that feel a bit like slowcore heroes Codeine. Sorrow and Extinction isnt first-person in that way, and its more clearly metal: This is sweeping, outdoor, mountaintop music. The lyrics have a mannered, sword-and-sorcery feel, situating death and sadness in towers, pyres, journeys, and the ancients; but even if you dont follow along with what the songs \"mean,\" Campbell has one of those deliveries that brings shivers regardless of what hes singing.\nThats the other thing that sets Pallbearer apart: As \"down\" and death-focused as the words and band name might be, this is uplifting stuff. (When the overlapping solos and subtle, arcing synth haze of \"Given to the Grave\" bring Sorrow and Extinction to an ecstatic end, youll be thinking more about life than death, believe me.) Ultimately, it feels like Pallbearer have created their own version of a traditional jazz funeral march, or like they went ahead and invented some sort of \"celebratory doom.\" Whatever you want to call it, the records a triumph.",

        "article_text": "Always different, always the same. This phrase was used by the late John Peel to describe his favorite band, the Fall. His observation about the Fall captures a broader idea about music fandom, describing what its like to follow along with a gifted artist who has created her own style but is no hurry to move outside of it. Always different, always the same. Its a phrase that comes to mind for me when I listen to the charred ambient music of Liz Harris Grouper. Her body of work is of a piece. She layers ethereal vocals that feel less like floating in the clouds and more like sinking into the dark earth, possibly while inside of a coffin; her music is a downcast mix of strummed acoustic guitar and defiantly analog sounding drone and noise-makers. With this small clutch of elements, shes made more than a half-dozen full-lengths and a number of singles and EPs, all of which sound like they could come from no one else. Indeed, the distinctiveness of Grouper is easy to take for granted. There are so many people making music that could fall under the broad heading of \"dream pop,\" but nobody sounds like Grouper. \nThere is one record in the Grouper catalog that, while certainly cut from the same frayed cloth, stands just slightly outside of the rest. Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill, first released in 2008, mostly forgoes the drones and minimalist experiments of her other work and focuses on Harris voice and strummed guitar. Its her \"folk\" record, in a way, even though it slots in easily next to her more drawn-out and noisy releases. It is also her best album, a classic of subtly devastating songwriting (its also an album Pitchfork initially underrated). Around the same time she was recording Deer, Harris cut a handful of songs in a similar vein for a planned album that was never released. Five years on comes The Man Who Died in the Boat, a companion record to Deer (which Kranky is also reissuing on vinyl) that shares many of its characteristics and essential appeal. \nGroupers most obvious contemporary is Julianna Barwick, but while the latters music has a certain formality and sense of communal ritual, Grouper is disconcertingly interior, as if youre listening in on something private. That feeling is reinforced by the more abstract moments here, which often feel like something tinkered with over many hours in a dark room. The opening \"6\" finds Harris voice on a damaged tape, bubbling up from the depths and mixing with swirls of feedback. The haunted \"Vanishing Point\" consists only of warbly metallic pings over a deep bed of tape hiss. The instrumental interludes arent necessarily much to listen to on their own (and Harris personal stamp on them is not as strong), but they do serve a purpose on the album, mixing up the flow of acoustic songs that might otherwise start to bleed together. But placed in relief by the abstracted bits, the individual character of the acoustic songs becomes apparent.\nDragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill had one of the more striking album covers in recent memory. Its a photo of Harris as a small child, wearing heavy makeup and a black dress that could look like a witchs costume. Though she doesnt generally seem interested in conveying the exact meaning of her songs and leaves a certain amount of that to the listener, the unsettling side of childhood innocence is a pervasive theme in her music. On the best of the songs here, like \"Clouds in Places\", the title track, \"Cover the Long Way\", Harris sounds very much like shes taking sing-song rhymes from childhood and running them through a cracked and ashen filter. They radiate a beauty that is simultaneously light and dark, with bright melodies draped with the inevitability of death.\nThe title of this release extends that idea, alluding to a scene from Harris childhood where she and her father came upon an empty boat that drifted to shore after the person in it disappeared. Its one of those flashes from long ago that stays with you, an early brush with the idea of mortality at a time when youre not capable of understanding exactly what it means. That sense of confusion, the difficulty of processing and articulation, seems built into Groupers art. Talking to people about her music, people who are typically ready to share half-formed opinions about music of any kind, I find they often have trouble coming up with words; when it really hits, as it often does here, the music of Grouper creates a feeling that can only be defined as awe, an uncanny mixture of wonder and dread that nobody does better. ",

        "article_text": "A$AP Rocky violated rule number one of the 10 Crack Commandments: Never let no one know how much dough you hold. The cheddar bred $3,000,000 worth of jealousy after the 23-year old New York rapper disclosed the value of his deal with Sony/RCA last month. The offer was tendered largely off the strength of his first two videos, \"Purple Swag\" and \"Peso\", a pair of codeine fever dreams that recast Harlem World as a slick-talking color-corrected suburb of Houston.\nTo cool-hunting 360-wielding record executives, the videos might as well have been advertisements for the A$AP lifestyle: Colt 45, purple weed and purple drank, dice games, bike riding, brandishing Berettas, clothing designers ostensibly known only to Kanye, and a pretty blonde girl in a grill mouthing the phrase: \"this is for my niggas getting high on the regular.\" Picture an episode of \"Gossip Girl\" where Blake Lively watches Traffic and subsequently opts to explore the Danger Zone of 125th and Lennox.\nUnavoidable in the conversation is the enduring absence of a New York commercial force under 30. Since the emergence of Dipset and G-Unit in the first half of the last decade, NYC rap aspirants have largely fallen into four categories: ringtone wunderkinds (\"This Is Why Im Hot\", \"Chicken Noodle Soup\"), technically skilled personality voids (Papoose, Saigon), artful traditionalists (Action Bronson, Roc Marciano, Ka), and Maino.\nBy contrast, Rocky was telegenic and chanting swag. His lead singles poured syrup-slow Houston ride music atop the malt liquor melodies of Harlems Max B. What Rocky lacked in lyricism, he made up for in narcotic charisma. Seeking street-cred, Drake announced plans to take Rocky on tour. Seeking swag-cred, Lloyd Banks and Jim Jones hopped on tracks with him. Hype metastasizes fastest in New York, and its easy to conflate the need for a standard bearer with the desire for a savior. Rocky was the chosen one. Hence, $3,000,000.\nCommence the hating. Odd Futures Hodgy Beats called him \"A$AP Copy.\" Old heads looked askance at his appropriation of styles alien to the five boroughs. Blogs painted it as the worst New York investment since the Yankees gave Brien Taylor $1.55 million. Rocky didnt help matters when he allegedly punched out a soundman at the Fader Fort and announced that he and his whole crew had adopted vegetarianism. Thus, every mention of his debut mixtape, LIVELOVEA$AP has pondered whether it justifies the price tag of a Bugatti and several dozen ivory backscratchers. Good isnt enough. People expect Rakim Mayers to be the second coming of his namesake.\nOf course, the odds are slanted in your favor when youre a rapper named Rakim. You cant exactly sell life insurance. And throughout LIVELOVEA$AP, Rocky embodies the sweat-free cool of someone who has stolen the test and memorized the answers ahead of time. It sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the heavily anticipated debut; there are no ill-fitting famous rapper cameos or last-cup leftovers from $10,000-a-beat producers. Rocky makes no cornball radio plays, nor any awkward attempts to prove his depth. Even on \"Demons\", the records most emotionally raw track, Rocky is preternaturally self-assured. Hes got stomach pains but dreams with the inevitable triumphalism of someone who can convince RCA/Polo Grounds to hand over their Pitbull blood money. After about a minute of complaining, hes back to \"fucking the chick youre next to.\" By rough estimate, Rocky fucks about 13 or 14 different girlfriends in the course of the albums 56 minutes. There are two different mentions of Naughty by Natures \"O.P.P.\". He is nothing if not efficient.\nThats the thing. Its pretty easy to point out the pitfalls of LIVELOVEA$AP. Thematic and lyrical concerns are basically limited to Rocky being a pretty motherfucker, repping Harlem, doing drugs, and getting more women than James Worthy in Houston. Rocky raps effortlessly, switching back and forth between Midwestern double-time to something that resembles Wiz Khalifa auditioning for Byrd Gang. The dark, drugged visions of Memphis rap also creep in throughout. But to his credit, he doesnt waste much time persecuting haters, preemptively striking only once on \"Leaf\": \"They say I sound like André/ Mixed with Kanye/ A little bit of Max/ A little bit of Wiz/ A little bit of that/ A little bit of this/ Get off my dick.\"\nIts more difficult to point out where exactly Rocky excels. Hes a good rapper, but hes not Kendrick Lamar. Hes melodic, but hes not a walking hook like 50 Cent. His voice is strong but not completely singular. Instead, Rocky has great instincts: the moment when he abruptly switches to his Bone Thugs-N-Harmony flow for a few bars in \"Trilla\", the bizarre song structure of \"Bass\", where he just repeats \"Bass\" in lieu of a hook; the last minute and a half of \"Demons\", where his scrambled lo-fi refrain fades into the chlorine fog of the Clams Casino beat.\nIf anything LIVELOVEA$AP is a triumph of immaculate taste. Rockys ear for beats is worthy of Rick Ross or early Game. Courtesy of Clams Casino, Burn One, Beautiful Lou, A$AP Ty Beats, and SpaceGhostpurrp, the stellar production makes this something like a swag-rap generation The Documentary. He cherry-picks from the best of internet micro-trends-- taking celestial based weirdness, the funk of country rap, the stoned pace of screw, and the tape-warp of Memphis. But at the core is the French-braided, gold-toothed kid from money-making Manhattan, inflecting his songs with hints of third-generation Spanish Harlem and West Indian patois. For someone who brags, \"the only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror,\" Rocky wisely cedes the spotlight to well-chosen guests, including Oaklands Main Attrakionz, Houstoner Fat Tony, and the larcenous intensity of L.A.s Schoolboy Q. Meanwhile his A$AP crew shows few signs of being there for reasons of nepotism or weed carrying.\n\"Houston Old Head\" might be the best sign that Rocky can deliver on his seven-figure potential. Its not necessarily the most memorable song, but its his most surprising-- a swaggering lean-sipping version of Neil Youngs \"Old Man\", with its chorus, \"If you listen when your old head talk/ Youll be straight.\" Its basically the opposite of Odd Futures youth worship-- the admission that occasionally your elders can put you up on game. It shows hes willing to listen and soak up different styles and sounds-- crucial elements for evolution. Even if the fusion initially seems unorthodox, LIVELOVEA$AP is exactly the sort of record youd expect to hear in 2011 from a New Yorker who was 13 when \"Big Pimpin\" came out. Rocky did what shouldve been expected of him; he made a very good record. Now we wait to see if hell get clientele.",

        "article_text": "For a mix of songs made at different times, Real Estates self-titled 2009 debut was impressively consistent. Given how well the New Jersey band fused disparate moments, you had to figure they could reach even greater heights were they to craft their next set all at once. They did just that last winter, and the result is indeed a step forward. Cleaner, sharper, and just plain stronger, Days is like a single idea divided into simple statements-- a suite of subtle variations on a theme.\nIts coherence sounds remarkably effortless, as if stringing together catchy gems is as easy as, in the words of one song, \"floating on an inner tube in the sun.\" Interestingly, Real Estate actually acknowledge this sense of ease. The opener is bluntly titled \"Easy\", and references to carefree simplicity abound. As singer/guitarist Martin Courtney puts it, \"If it takes all summer long/ Just to write one simple song/ Theres too much to focus on/ Clearly there is something wrong.\" But the bands celebration of the uncomplicated is less about how Days was written than about the beauty of life seen in retrospect, especially young life in small towns.\nLike the stirring scenes of suburban Texas in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life, these songs find meaning in daily mundanities-- in houses and gardens, phone lines and street lights, names carved in trees and leaves pressed by footsteps. \"All those wasted miles/ All those aimless drives through green aisles,\" sings Courtney wistfully. \"Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise.\" That sentiment was evident on the bands debut, but here theyve honed it to its essence.\nThe music bears a simplicity to match. These arent minimal songs by any means, but the layers of cycling guitar, rolling rhythm, and gentle echo are always understated, more about conveying feeling than showing off the bands considerable chops. Theres also a smooth efficiency in these rich tunes. No note feels wasted, and nothing happens at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Much of this precision comes from guitarist Matt Mondanile, whose nimble playing adds color to each songs shape. Its most noticeable in the insistent \"Its Real\", but Im even more taken with his sonic smoke rings in \"Out of Tune\", and how his shimmering guitar evokes sunrays mingling through branches and sparkling off pools.\nThat idyllic tone permeates Days, and in lesser hands could deprive it of tension or variety. But Real Estate have such a knack for classic-sounding melody that every song quickly engages on a musical gut level. Its a quality their music shares with the jangly hooks of early R.E.M., the breeziness of later Pavement, and the garage twang of the Fresh \u0026 Onlys. But their closest kin are New Jersey forefathers the Feelies. That groups undying ability to mine repeated chords and Zen phrases is matched best by the albums closer, \"All the Same\", a looping study of how night and day are merely sides of the same coin. Lasting over seven minutes, it might be Real Estates first epic. But its as subtle and unassuming as anything on Days-- more evidence from this band that great music doesnt have to sound hard to make, even if it is.",

        "article_text": "Gorilla Manor, the debut album from L.A.s Local Natives, features rustic and yearning vocals, three-part harmonies, clattering percussion, wiggly guitar leads, euphoric chanting, and a Talking Heads cover. In short, the Silver Lake quintet have followed indie rocks major players in recent years-- they knew how to dress for success in 2010. Great for them-- now, whats in it for you? Plenty as it turns out.\nLocal Natives have already gained a foothold in parts of Europe-- their album has received attention in the UK and they graced the cover of Scandinavias Sonic magazine late last year-- at home in L.A., and online. With good reason too: Advance singles \"Airplanes\" and \"Sun Hands\" recalled elements of Dodos or the Fleet Foxes. The best comparison perhaps is that theyre sort of a West Coast Grizzly Bear-- right down to naming an album after the location in which it was recorded. Yet whereas Grizzly Bears Yellow House is a cozy, isolated New England seaside shack, Local Natives Gorilla Manor is a squalid Orange County party pad.\nAt first listen that seems off-- the chops and compositional sense here are the most immediately impressive part of the album. But dig deeper and you realize Local Natives never lose sight of the pleasures of being a youthful rock band-- right down to themes of wanderlust and discovery. \"Oh, to see it with my own eyes,\" goes to the central lyrics to album opener \"Wide Eyes\". This inquisitiveness and quest for self-knowledge may as well be the records life-affirming and open-armed thesis statement.\nIndeed, this optimism relishes experience and finds opportunity where others may see obstacles: Garage rocker \"Camera Talk\" initially reads like a harried travelogue (\"Were running through the aisles/ Of the churches still in style\"), but the  band still comes off like theyre living the dream-- \"  And even though I cant be sure/ Memory tells me that these times are worth working for.\"  \"Airplanes\" is a tribute to one of the bandmembers pilot grandfather, and while the counterpoints of strings and piano are buoyant enough its the evocative images (chopsticks from his time spent in Japan, a well-thumbed encyclopedia) that indicate his life was well-lived.\nBut even where the lyrics get more obtuse (a Skype exchange with an ex is likened to a \"Cubism Dream\"), theres almost always a strong pulse running through the busy, precise compositions: \"Shape Shifter\", for example, is about impressionistic themes of self-reckoning but the sentiment is also reflected in the songs arrangement. At certain points, its Gorilla Manors sludgiest track; at others, its the most quicksilver and agile. The strings and harmonies of the glacial \"Cards \u0026 Quarters\" and \"Who Knows, Who Cares?\" are gorgeous, but drum rolls and washes of cymbal hint at imminent collapse. Only closer \"Sticky Thread\" offers calm.\nSo while the records second half dials back the tempo, stuck in its midsection is a cover of the Talking Heads, hardly a band that would be considered \"loose.\" \"Warning Sign\" isnt the most canonical of their songs, but taking it on is an audacious decision for a band that would be wise to let the comparisons come to them first. They retain the elasticity of the bassline and the general verse-chorus structure, but thats about it: David Byrnes pinprick vocals are treated with melodic contour and supple harmonies, the breakdown veers from nervous to joyfully emphatic, and the guitars soften around the edges. Whether its \"better\" than the original is besides the point-- at least for four minutes, Local Natives take ownership of it, fully integrating what might have been an incompatible hard left turn into the records seamless whole. True, we tend to bow at novelty and innovation, but Gorilla Manor proves to be a refreshing reminder of the pleasures of synthesis.",

        "article_text": "Andrew Savage is, above all, a stylist. Before he came to be known as the yawpy mouthpiece co-fronting Brooklyn indie rock outfit Parquet Courts, he was one-half of Denton, Tx. duo Fergus \u0026 Geronimo, where he and bandmate Jason Kelly made the type of reference-heavy experimental rock that was practically designed to catch the ears of rock nerds as much as it was bound to confound casual passersby. Their sense of humor and slavish devotion to past sounds was reminiscent of Ween, if Ween wrote songs about parasitic music writers and trust-fund hippies. 2011s Unlearn opened with a song called \"Girls With English Accents\" (try and guess what it was about); the following years Funky Was the State of Affairs kicked off with Savage and Kelly doing the best \"Allo, guvnor\" affectations they could muster. Funky was a sorta-concept album that carried thematic allusions to Funkadelics Maggot Brain while sometimes resembling if Gang of Four covered \"Peter Gunn\" in double time.\nIt only took two albums for the delightfully, inscrutably weird Fergus \u0026 Geronimo to sound like they were running out of steam, and by the time Funky Was the State of Affairs saw release, Savage had put up roots in New York City and was wielding the influences of his new home in Parquet Courts. The bands debut release, the 2011 cassette American Specialties, featured cover art ripped from the light-box Chinese restaurant menus that are ubiquitous throughout the city; the following years Light Up Gold paired musings about pushy street-team clipboard-brandishers and being stoned in Queens over music smacking of the literate, nervy rock music that emerged after punks first wave burned out in the late 1970s.\nIn interviews, Savage hasnt been shy about his aspirations to claim a place in NYCs considerable rock lineage. Inarguably, the city hasnt seen a unified, geographically-defining scene emerge since the days of Julian and Karen, so Parquet Courts sound less like a \"New York band\" than they resemble a band that carries qualities that people have associated with New York bands of years past—structural slackness paired with paranoid energy, topped off with a sense of wit that exudes book-smarts as much as it smacks of smart-assedness.\nOn their third and best album, Sunbathing Animal, they continue to expand their musical horizons by offering more of their own takes on older sounds: there are sonic nods to the spiky energy of Wire circa Pink Flag, the Velvet Undergrounds relentless chug, Televisions more straightforward moments of elegance, Bob Dylans braying ramble, surf rocks angular riffs filtered through amphetamine-poisoned blood. Most surprisingly, the loping \"Dear Ramona\" comes off as a post-collegiate update of frat-rock luminaries Cakes \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\", swapping the latters shiny fingernails and cupholder armrests for black coffee and moleskine notebooks.\nAbove all, the spectre of sly-smile indie-rock kings Pavement looms over Sunbathing Animal, more so in execution than in explicit resemblance. If Light Up Gold carried the dashed-off basement charm of Slanted and Enchanted, then Sunbathing Animal is Parquet Courts Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, a record that focuses more on structure as the band deploys melodic tricks with greater subtlety and precision. Crooked Rain still stands as the Stockton-hailing Pavements most West Coast-sounding album, and the humidity of Sunbathing Animal similarly calls back to Parquet Courts Texan roots, its wide-open sprawl sounding freed of the bands explicitly urban trappings.\nRecorded over the course of three days, the propulsive energy of Light Up Gold sometimes resembled a quartet of short-distance runners about to collide into each other, limbs akimbo, while reaching the finish line. Sunbathing Animal, then, sounds like the work of long-distance pavement-pounders who have learned when to store up energy, and when to release it. As an album, its impeccably structured, with the slow-burn cuts placed in just the right places to break up the bands steady crunch; Parquet Courts newfound sense of control works in miniature, too, as evidenced by the coiled guitar breakdowns on opener \"Bodies Made Of\" and the back half of \"Black \u0026 White\", where the bands scraping choogle spins out into freewheeling zonked-out noise before pulling back to reveal a shimmying rhythmic duckwalk, anchored by hand claps.\nThe increased focus of pacing on Sunbathing Animal means that, at first blush, its a less immediate album than its predecessor; at 46 minutes, its a little less than a quarter-hour longer than Light Up Gold, and theres a few extended jams—the molasses-tumble of \"Shes Rolling\" and \"Instant Disassembly\"s folksy ramble both go beyond the six-minute mark—that take cues from the anti-anthem \"Hes Seeing Paths\", from last years Tally All the Things That You Broke EP. The hooks are stronger and more distinct, though, in the sense that Sunbathing Animal registers as 13 separate songs, a change from Light Up Golds energizing blur. The guitar work, courtesy of co-frontmen Savage and Austin Brown, is clever and accomplished without being too showy; in their hands, the instruments squeak, saunter, and roar, sometimes simultaneously. On the title track and the albums most aggressive cut, the duo merge to create an impenetrable wall of strings, soloing recklessly underneath each other as drummer Max Savage (brother to Andrew) bashes away in a manner reminiscent of a specific, not-always-sunbathing animal.\n\"Sunbathing Animal\" is four minutes of impassioned fury that doubles as a solid punk tune and as a speed-addled take on pre-Beatles rocknroll—but forget the video, all you need is the lyric sheet to tell that Savage is singing from the perspective of a housecat. \"I want to flee/ But I can only stare,\" he laments furiously, one of many times that he and Brown get lyrically weird on Sunbathing Animal. The sloganeering and sneering found on Light Up Gold is gone, along with most notions of straightforwardness, as the closest either singer gets to clarity is on the back-from-touring grievance-list \"Always Back in Town\". Otherwise, the lyrics are stranger, more elliptical, less \"Stoned and Starving\" and more just plain stoned. \"What color is blood?/ Still the same that it was?,\" Savage yells over the ascending strut of \"What Color Is Blood\", taking on the bug-eyed paranoia of David Byrne circa More Songs About Buildings and Food; on \"Instant Disassembly\", he conflates love, anxiety, and protection before admitting that the firmament containing those virtues is in serious decay: \"Theres nothing left to dismantle/ The house it just collapsed on itself.\"\nYet again recalling Pavement in their glory days, Parquet Courts remain inscrutable even as their talents grow, a band less willing to show their hand as they are interested in describing why hands are such weird body parts to begin with. The closest thing Savage offers as far as a lyrical clue to the bands general mindset is buried in the middle of \"Instant Disassembly\": \"Turn on the white noise murmur of the AM band/ And the last classic rock bands last solid record creeps in.\" The couplet could, in a way, be a joke about the permanence of musical obsolescence—but it doubles as a mission statement, too, as Parquet Courts are a band using the past to write their own version of the present. If youre looking for something \"new,\" you arent going to find it here, and thats totally okay: Sunbathing Animals considered, whip-smart rock revivalism is a work of substantial growth from a band that already did \"simple\" quite well, placing Parquet Courts in their own distinct weight class.",

        "article_text": "When last years Street Halo came out, it was met with the same breathless hysteria that has greeted every new morsel of Burial music since Untrue. But you couldnt help but feel that the ghostly two-step master had become a little predictable. Even as the producer experimented with house music on the title track (which he had done previously on \"Raver\" and \"Versus\"), it felt as if he were re-using the same sounds and effects. A year later, and with still no sign of a third album, were treated to another three-track EP. But unlike Street Halo, Kindred, currently available digitally only, breaks nearly every Burial precedent there is, from the 12-minute-long tracks to an new sound design that feels consummately richer than the genius of his earlier work.\nOf the three, \"Kindred\" (12-minute symphony No. 1) will be the most recognizable to Burial die-hards, featuring that same clanking metal-on-metal garage skip-and-swing. But this time something just feels heavier, harder, more devastating. Burials been credited since the beginning as a prophet tying together UK genres old and new, but theres never been a better argument than \"Kindred\", which hints at the agility of jungle with the lead-footed heft of dubstep as seen through elliptical garage beats. They tumble and timestretch like vintage Metalheadz underneath smouldering Reese basslines, and the vocals lack Burials usual phrases, instead choking out syllables smothered by the aural ash and soot that seems to soak the recording in a humongous, unearthly rumbling. As a whole \"Kindred\" sounds bigger than anything hes done before, an infinitely detailed behemoth that lumbers and shakes the ground beneath it with every little stroke of movement.\n\"Kindred\" is basically a suite in itself, a new kind of tumult that only heightens Burials usual wrenching sorrow, an ambitious new venture repeated in Kindreds other two tracks. \"Loner\" outdoes the sad-sack ecstacy of Untrues similarly housey \"Raver\"-- for one thing, its a lot faster-- but its coated in MDMA residue, its chugging kick-and-snare pattern and almost prog-house pumping chord progression drowning in gloss. That chemical energy lends its fatalism an almost heroic sense of momentum, moving and moving and never quite getting anywhere but into the same empty, desperate silence that swallowed \"Kindred\". Its a well-timed track, navigating the same obsession with house and techno thats gripping the entire bass music world and turning it into something distinctly Burial, perverting houses speedy metronome (and prog houses politics of bliss) into profound, otherworldly sadness.\nBut as impressive as those two tracks are, theres no real way to prepare for \"Ashtray Wasp\", also built on a broken house lope. This time its overloaded with funereal synths and arpeggios that twirl frantically in anguish as if they had nowhere else to go, saturating the cloudy soundscape with particulate matter so intricate its a wonder all this sound data can be contained in a single mp3, nevermind a groove in wax. The fluttering effects are only further confused by the bleary smudge of it all, cinematic and grand but stuck in Burials world of canned frequencies: The locust-swarm effect of the filters is impossibly stirring, far more visceral than perfect clarity ever could have been. It falls apart about seven minutes in before reconstructing into an even more decayed beat, violently wedged apart by static-- recalling the most challenging work of the Caretaker and his vinyl experiments. \"Ashtray Wasp\" suggests a structural intricacy and awe-inspiring execution from one of electronic musics mopiest producers, and the result might be his definitive track.\nIts hard to talk about Kindred-- whether in the context of electronic dance music or just in the Burial discography itself-- without resorting to superlative terms, because it really is just that impressive. Its easy enough to take a talent such as Burial for granted, but Kindred is like a convenient slap in the face, a wake up call. Never before has his music possessed this much majesty, this much command, this much power: The pathos here has moved from sympathetic to completely domineering. The amount of dialog around Burial can be a little hard to swallow sometimes, especially when the guy himself seems so resistant-- or at least indifferent-- to the ongoing intellectualization of his music. But what we get on Kindred isnt some loner unknowingly making genius out of samples from Metal Gear Solid on his Playstation. You might not think of refinement when you think of Burials productions, but just try to imagine it, and youll get an idea of the kind of glory that Kindred carries. It still might not be the follow-up to Untrue that everyones been waiting for, but format feels completely irrelevant. When those beats fall into place on the title track, nothing else matters for the next 30 minutes, until the crackle and fizz of \"Ashtray Wasps\" finally fades away. Then you put it on again. And again. And again.",

        "article_text": "Ever since Hot Chip started as indie kids seemingly dabbling in classic soul and modern R\u0026B, theyve been underestimated (not least of which by us). Delivering lines about \"20-inch rims\" and \"Yo La Tengo\" in a proper English accent, as they did on their 2005 debut, can have that effect. Yet on their two subsequent records-- 2006s The Warning and 2008s Made in the Dark-- Hot Chip steadily rebuilt their reputation by toughening up their sophistipop side. Their melodies began to develop an itchy, nervous twitch, and they earned dancefloor credibility through an association with DFA.\nBest of all, Hot Chip crafted some of the sneakiest and most effective earworms around-- songs that seem deceptively simple and assuming on first listen became year-end list locks by listen number 10. Their quirky detours, winks, and nods were no longer Prince and Stevie Wonder shoutouts; instead, they were subtler, so the band that initially came across as affable goofballs eventually revealed themselves to be the smartest guys in the room. In short, after a half-decade of having our expectations challenged and any hesitations about them erased, it finally felt like we knew who Hot Chip were. But their fourth album, One Life Stand, changes things a bit. After dialing back some of their eccentricities, their latest feels if anything even more likely to be underestimated.\nOddly, this is arguably their best record yet. Whether youll agree will depend on what you want from Hot Chip and what you want from an album. One Life Stand is their most consistent and most complete record, but its missing an A-list single on par with \"Boy From School\", \"Over and Over\", or \"Ready for the Floor\". Its also missing dance songs in the mode of the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic. Some will claim its them growing up, but thats not true-- theyve always exhibited panache and sophistication. This is simply the first time since their debut that theyve primarily honed in on those sensibilities, in the process revealing just how far theyve come sonically in the past five years.\nIts a bold move but well earned. The bands split personality was in full effect on Made in the Dark, which flitted between heart-on-sleeve songs like \"Were Looking for a Lot of Love\" and \"One Pure Thought\" and nebbishy hip-shakers like \"Shake a Fist\" and \"Bendable Poseable\". If you wanted a record of the former without the latter, well youre in luck, because thats basically what you have here. As Pitchforks Ryan Dombal pointed out to me, its a move akin to the one Pet Shop Boys took circa Behaviour-- a near-shedding of their more overt disco and house influences and an embrace of personal songwriting free of irony or distance.\nBecause the songs not only share mood and tone but also are generally of the same high quality, One Life Stand has a sense of consistency and completeness missing from their other records, too. At its most basic, One Life Stand is a record of love songs; more specifically, its often a record of self-actualization and redemption-- of recognizing our need for real human connection. Whether about romance or friendship, the songs on One Life Stand are often about commitment (as the album title indicates) and reciprocal relationships. These qualities arent typically celebrated in pop culture-- stable monogamy and sensitive male bonding dont have the inherent drama of a star-crossed, fleeting, or unrequited love, after all.\nAnd yet Hot Chip locate the beauty and power in commitment and in stability. Fully two-thirds of the record is built upon proclamations of long-lasting love, which is made clear in many of the records key lyrics: \"You are my love light,\" \"I only wanna be your one life stand,\" \"Please take my heart and keep it close to you,\" \"Happiness is what we all want,\" \"I only want one life together in our arms.\"\nIf that seems like a sort of bait and switch, then youve really underestimated Hot Chip, because theyve been trading in this sort of sincerity for years. On the one hand, between their inauspicious start, geek-chic dancefloor excursions, and videos, Hot Chip can be viewed as wired, robotic, almost anti-human. Yet Hot Chip have functioned as sort of a mirror image of intelligent, dryly confessional 1980s bands like ABC and the Pet Shop Boys: Whereas lyricists like Martin Fry and Neil Tennant smuggled cynicism into the Top 40, Hot Chip sneak sincerity into an indie electro-pop scene dominated at times by the dress-up of blog-house. Perhaps its no coincidence then that the best of their peers-- electro-soul brothers-in-arms Junior Boys and big-room dance stars Justice-- are also so straight-faced that people also assumed at first they were each a put-on. And each of the three is far outstripping those chasing fads. (Hey, wheres that Uffie record weve been \"promised\"?)\nWeirdly, the songs here most likely to turn people off arent the odes to everlasting love, but those explicitly about the importance of male connection (\"Brothers\") or the quest for spiritual guidance (\"Slush\"). And yet these are the records twin centerpieces. Neither is as embraceable as singles and potential singles \"One Life Stand\", \"Take It In\", \"Hand Me Down Your Love\", or \"I Feel Better\", but theyre the tracks that elevate the record from a collection of very good songs to a complete picture of an important band near the peak of its powers. Whether Hot Chip now stay in this headspace and sonic range-- perhaps there is a record full of nervy, upbeat and/or more tongue-in-cheek songs á la \"The Warning\" or \"Wrestler\" next-- wont obscure the risk theyve taken here by fully embracing big-hearted electro-pop. And it wont obscure how successfully theyve done it either.",

        "article_text": "When Chaz Bundick sang, \"I found a job I do it fine/ Not what I want but still I try,\" on \"Blessa\", it became Causers of This most-quoted lyric for obvious reasons. Not only can all of us relate to that sentiment at some point in our lives, but it also drew a direct line between the escapism of home-made electro-pop and the lives of most of the people creating it. Talk about Hipstamatic prints, Ariel Pink, and surfing all you want, but yknow, its also the economy, stupid. Now, Ive never shared a cubicle with Bundick, but that kind of resignation is completely at odds with his work ethic as Toro Y Moi, given the steady stream of remixes and side projects hes released in the time since. Just over a year later, hes already the first of the A-listers from this scene to release a follow-up. But if he was feeling any pressure to validate himself and his peers, Underneath the Pine doesnt show it. The album may be too lyrically opaque to have a line as bloggable as \"Blessa\"s, but its a far richer and more accomplished whole, and it makes a strong case for Bundick as an artist with scope, ambition, and a firm grasp of how to balance the two.\nUnderneath the Pine begins a little like the last album, with a wobbly, splayed-out chord backing Bundicks cooed vocal salutation. But where \"Blessa\"s murky, aquamarine production set the tone for most of Causers, this albums \"Intro/Chi Chi\" is a textured instrumental that trigger memories of Airs \"La Femme DArgent\" and underscores one of Bundicks most overlooked assets: his ability to create an appealingly lush ambiance. That mood plays a central role in Underneath the Pine, as much of the album sheds Bunwicks synth-pop roots in favor of a vastly expanded instrumental palette that includes organ, pianos, chimes, and plenty of live drumming. Bundicks skill as an arranger is especially evident in Pines midsection: though casually paced and humid as his native South Carolina, it pulls from the French pop and krautrock obsessions of Broadcast and Stereolab, imbuing pastoral, acoustic plucks and synth drones with rhythmic purpose, and making retro chic somehow still sound futuristic.\nAll of this sonic exploration is in service to Bundicks growth as a songwriter. Big choruses like the one on \"How I Know\" come unexpectedly during what at first appear to be endless motorik grooves, as plainspoken vocal melodies give way to double-helix harmonies. Even the tracks that keep a lower profile maintain enough ballast to prevent the zone-outs that pockmarked Causers. They also serve to set off the big singles, \"New Beat\" and \"Still Sound\". Heard individually, those songs straight-up funk delivery mostly sounded like twists on a successful formula, but in context on Underneath the Pine, they underscore how Bundicks knack for analog warmth always comes in the name of physicality and groove. You may want to try and peg where the drum sounds come from-- maybe Innervisions, maybe even Midnite Vultures-- but rhythmic interplay this addictive has to be felt, not simply conjured from memory.\nBecause Toro Y Moi is so closely linked with the likes of Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Memory Tapes, its tempting to read into the success of Underneath the Pine as some predictor of those bands collective staying power, or a direction others might take. But Bundick seems to be following nothing but his own internal compass. Late in the album, \"Good Hold\" comes off like an Eno tribute of detuned piano dissonance, and then morphs into the blissful glide of album closer, \"Elise\". Its a fitting send-off to Underneath the Pine, suggesting that Toro Y Mois first great album probably wont be his last, or his best.",

        "article_text": "The cover art for the Ruby Suns sophomore disc, Sea Lion, is a fitting allegory for head Sun Ryan McPhun: A boy on an island takes pains to try to costume himself, tangling himself in lights and string, and wearing a feather in his hair and a crown on his head. McPhuns work as the Ruby Suns functions in much the same way: Stationed on New Zealands North Island, the California native dresses his work in global music, nibbling at the edges of unfamiliar sounds but, ultimately, skillfully creating sunny psych-pop.\nThe result is an album of environments, both natural and imagined, hinted at by the cover arts pastel Candyland, the collage of African wildlife on the CD insert, and McPhuns tributes to his home states Mojave desert and Joshua Trees (\"Oh, Mojave\"). The albums title refers to the colony of animals that sun in the ocean off of Californias Highway 1, and on \"There Are Birds\", co-vocalist Amee Robinson pines for a world where \"there are birds and it is calm.\" A host of animal references doesnt equate to an environmentally conscious album, but Sea Lion takes to heart quaint state park signage: take only pictures, leave only footprints. The Ruby Suns visit the world via an array of global signifiers-- pinging conga drums, field recordings of animals, slight, sunny harmonies-- but as they do, the band sounds genuinely curious and respectfully adoptive rather than calculating or opportunistic.\nSea Lion, therefore, has a fair amount of clutter-- expect comparisons to musically busy peers like Panda Bear or the Russian Futurists, and to the jumbled orchestral experimentation of Olivia Tremor Control-- but the albums building blocks ooze with a homespun grace. Opener \"Blue Penguin\" rubs the sleep out of its eyes before grinding a dirty acoustic guitar into overdriven tape. The tender horns on \"Remember\" are reminiscent of the gentle indie rock of Beulah before introducing a coda of warm, looped sighing. \"Adventure Tour\"s high-pitched, descending choruses recall Avey Tare. \"Tane Mahuta\", sung in indigenous Maori, provides the sole link to McPhuns adopted home, but the songs furious strumming and dewy harmonies are straight from power- and African- (think Tabu Ley) pop.\nSea Lion likely will be pegged a great guitar-pop album, but its more sonically complex than that suggests. Intriguingly, some of its stylistic conceits-- the 4AD hum of \"There Are Birds\" or the New Order-via-Graceland second half of \"Morning Sun\"-- are found on both their most straightforward and best pop moments. Meanwhile, the unfortunately titled \"Its Mwangi in Front of Me\", and the even worse \"Kenya Dig It?\", provide the record its most abstract, collage-inspired moments. Sea Lions one constant is its hard-charging positivity; even songs that begin with a slow drizzle (\"Ole Rinka\") or hesitant atmospherics (\"Blue Penguin\") end up as paeans to suns or birds or-- most traditionally-- love. Sea Lions artwork, song titles, and McPhuns background all suggest something pan-global and yet the album shines brightest when it stays closest to its indie rock roots-- a reminder that despite their escapist charms, exploration and travel work best as an accent to the familiarity and comfort of home.",

        "article_text": "\"The Wests asleep,\" PJ Harvey declares on the first line of her new album, Let England Shake, before spending the next 40 minutes aiming to shame, frighten, and agitate it into action. When Polly Jean Harvey burst into the public consciousness in the early 90s, her gravelly voice, outsized personality, and often disturbing lyrics gave the alt-rock world a crucial shot of excitement. That early work is still among the most raw and real guitar music to emerge from the past few decades, so no surprise, its a version of PJ Harvey a lot of people still miss. But if youve paid attention to her in the years since, the one thing you can expect is that she wont repeat herself.\nOn Let England Shake, Harvey is not often upfront or forceful; her lyrics, though, are as disturbing as ever. Here, she paints vivid portraits of war, and her sharp focus on the up-close, hand-to-hand devastation of World War I-- depicting \"soldiers falling like lumps of meat\"-- provides a fitting setting for todays battlegrounds. From the Zombies to the Pogues, artists have often gravitated to the confused, massive loss of life of the Great War. If it doesnt resonate as much in America as it does in Europe-- and it doesnt-- thats more our fortune than our shame.\nThe Great War remains a rich and resonant subject for art because it briefly caused the world to step back, aghast and afraid to look at what it had done. The collective trauma of World War I did indeed shake England, specifically, out of the end of its imperialistic Victorian stupor. The rest of the world gasped as well: WWI hastened the Russian Revolution, coaxed the U.S. into isolationism and a flirtation with pacifism, and set the tone for a shunned Germany to embrace the Third Reich. Culturally, the result was modernism, dadaism, and surrealism continuing to overtake the giddiness of la belle époque; geopolitically, it redrew European borders, creating roughly a dozen new nations; diplomatically, the League of Nations, a precursor to the United Nations, was meant to prevent war, at least on this scale, from ever happening again.\nOn \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes. After spinning tales lamenting what a soldier has seen and done, she and her cohorts-- frequent collaborators John Parish and Mick Harvey-- break into the jaunty closing refrain from \"Summertime Blues\": \"What if I take my problems to the United Nations?\" Its a hilariously depressing coda; her songs character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help.\nThroughout the record, Harvey sings in her higher register, as she often did on the underrated White Chalk, granting her some detachment from her surroundings. Instead of owning the spotlight outright, as she did in the 90s, she floats above and beside it; its a neat trick that forces listeners to crawl closer to her words, allowing them to slowly come into focus. The textural and tonal qualities of her voice are made malleable, a scalpel wielded with precision rather than a sword. On the whole, she carries distant echoes of her peers and successors-- Joanna Newsom, Björk, Kate Bush-- while remaining clearly and identifiably herself.\nHarvey does this musically too, incorporating traces of English folk, early rock, reverbed dream-pop, and disparate familiar melodies (as well as \"Summertime Blues,\" she appropriates Niney the Observers apocalyptic \"Blood and Fire\" on the one directly Iraq-related song here, \"Written on the Forehead\", plus a close approximation of \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" that originally played a larger role on the record) as a foundation. With autoharp, zither, saxophone, and other new instruments added to her palette, Harvey crucially crafts sturdy, earwormy melodies. If you didnt listen to the words, the record would scan as beautiful, even docile or tame. Harvey forces you to locate the real world behind a pleasantly hazy foreground.\nEven considering all of the horror on display, this is her most straightforward and easy to embrace album in a decade. Along with \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", the bouncing title track, the radio rock of \"The Last Living Rose\", and \"Written on the Forehead\" would all make excellent singles. Theyll all get a chance, so to speak: Harvey commissioned war photographer Seamus Murphy to craft videos for each of the records dozen tracks. (Three of them have already been released: \"Let England Shake\", \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", and \"The Last Living Rose\".) As much of a piece as this record is, its songs also work in their own contexts, and despite using a limited number of players and instruments, Harvey and co. locate a wide range of approaches to their central subject; alongside the singles, those include the rousing folk-rock of \"Bitter Branches\", the delicate \"Hanging in the Wire\", and the acoustic \"England\".\nEven a cursory glance at the album-- its title, song titles, lyrics-- marks this as a very English record. Its pastoralism befits Harveys West Country background and recording setting (as well as the fields in Europe in which most of WWI was fought, and where most of the dead are now laid to rest). But its less about the experience of one nation with war, so much as one people. That those people are English is Harvey soaking her music in her own surroundings and experiences. Swap out the place names with others, though, and the message remains the same. Its universal and its necessary-- and its powerfully and clearly stated. That its also a joy to hear is perhaps the most confounding juxtaposition of all, turning a record youll respect into one youll also love.",

        "article_text": "Bass producers tend to treat innovation like daily prayer: If not duly performed at regular intervals, some ill-defined Very Bad Thing will happen. The thirst for innovation is such that some scene-watchers have likened current bass music to post-punk, stratifying its sounds in search of growth. Previous British dance movements-- drumnbass and garage-- found such terrifying end-games that the bass scene has made a constant effort to never stop swimming. To brand an artist as someone who simply executes, however masterfully, is to damn him with faint praise. Increasingly, bass producers have looked backward (thumping, linear 4/4 bangers) or forward (mutated footwork fever-dreams), largely ignoring (as Pitchfork writer Philip Sherburne put it in discussion), the fertile terrain between Burial and Joy Orbison.\nOn their debut full-length for Scubas Hotflush label, New York duo Sepalcure nimbly incorporate current trends but arrive at a sound-- politely mysterious rhythms put to life by haunted vocal samples-- thats familiar and rich. Sepalcure is a collaboration between two dance veterans, Praveen Sharma and Travis Stewart. That their album scans as a bit of a melting pot should not surprise. Sharma runs dance media hub Percussion Lab and records misty, retro-futuristic house as Braille. Stewart hops genres as Machinedrum, whose footwork-fusion album Room(s) is widely regarded as one of the years best dance releases (I regret underrating its idiosyncrasies).\nAdmittedly influenced by the scores of talent massing on forward-thinking bass labels like Hotflush and Hessle Audio, their collaboration was the result of boredom and opportunity (Sharmas girlfriend, visual artist Sougwen Chung, was studying abroad; she handles all of the groups visuals). Some combination of serendipity and skill saw the duos first tracks fall into the hands of Mary Anne Hobbs and Paul Rose (Scuba); two well-received EPs later, a short two-week recording session birthed Sepalcure.\nThat Sepalcure is so balanced and organized can be attributed to the experience and seeming calm of its principals; that it sounds so lively and inviting is the greater achievement. While syncopated rhythms-- pattering cymbals and kicks with now-familiar handclaps-- and probing bass sponge up dubsteps urban paranoia, Sharma and Stewart add plenty of more explicitly emotional touches to their work. How else to explain the Whos \"See Me, Feel Me\" stretched transparent over, um, \"See Me Feel Me\"? (And how the hell did that sample get cleared?) Or the hammy Italo-disco pianos that build up under the fingernails of \"Hold On\" and \"Yuh Nuh See\"? Sepalcures moody haze and mid-song shifts prevent it from being dance-floor fodder (\"The One\" is a welcome exception), but neither is it music by which to lonesomely stare at rainstorms.\nVocals play a prominent role throughout. During their best moments, Sharma and Stewart subject rave-y house divas to dubsteps pinched nausea, turning the gospel-like fervor of their sources into grimy hymns. (Those new to the group should acquaint themselves with early single \"Love Pressure\".) \"Breezin\" is especially devoted, its tremulous refrain-- \"Mountains high and low!\"-- ascending above its buzzy synths. The duo recorded many of the instruments live, and there is a punch especially to the pianos (electric and acoustic) that their contemporaries frequently lack. They layer these instruments expertly, and tracks such as lead single \"Pencil Pimp\" and \"Eternally Yrs\" function as bass-y, house-y suspensions: discrete parts bound by weightless float. Tufts of melody chunk off \"Yuh Nuh See\", as its meticulous, six-note sequence snakes around a vocal hum and sprinkled, choral beauty.\nStraightforward descriptions of Sepalcure-- a finely manicured mix of dubstep, house, UK funky, and footwork-- make it sound pedestrian, even contrived. The reality is anything but; Sharma and Stewart have found an alleyway that few other producers have traversed in 2011. Bass producers can treasure-hunt all they want, but increasingly it feels like someone should stay behind to stack the doubloons. Stewart is moving to Berlin, casting doubt on Sepalcures future. If they never record again, their collaboration may mirror their achievement here: an evolutionary moment, familiar and brief enough to gloss over, rich enough to return to.",

        "article_text": "In the corner of every show-- even if its the dirtiest, smelliest AS220 showcase or an impromptu Lightning Bolt concert in a Jamaica Plain kitchen-- theres always some guy with a beard talking to another guy with a beard about feelings. There they are, right in the thick of no-bullshit rock n roll-- fucking noise rock, mang-- bitching about trust and love and What She Did, while all their buddies are breaking dishes during \"13 Monsters\" and sweating in the July heat and Spiewak sweatshirts they all secretly bought off Karmaloop. Today the noise is just too much-- something Beard Guy No. 1 never thought hed say-- and he takes a taxi back to his parents house in Greenwich, climbs into his Throbbing Gristle pajamas, and cries cries cries until his hornrims fog up.\nEven noise guys need break-up albums, records that can pull them out of their funk without making them feel like complete assholes-- and simply put, Death From Above 1979s second album and Vice Records debut, Youre a Woman, Im a Machine, is the answer. The album title only hints at the viciousness with which this Toronto bass/drums/vox administers its own emotional purge. The whole affair sounds admittedly far-fetched, especially considering both the bands musical history-- their 2003 debut Heads Up was good and short but merely barked-- and the bands apparent dickheadedness: After Death From Above Records (aka the DFA), approached the band to change its name, the duo responded by tacking on the legal minimum of numbers to their moniker and posting to their former web site: \"FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT... james murphy is a selfish piece of fuck that will burn in the flames of a specially dedicated rock and roll jihad. if i had the resources i would fly a plane into his skull.\"\nYoure a Woman comes as an unexpected and almost regrettable delight in that sense-- it has the attitude, but possibly too much substance, for a true Vice Records release. This is high-gloss, feel-better noise-rock that balances riff-heavy micro-Sabbath bravado with a tenderness quite foreign to the current Providence-born noise scene (of which DFA79 may not be considered to be their contemporaries after Youre a Woman). Some might bemoan the albums accessibility, but thats hooks, actual song structure, and broken hearts for you: By turning the rock knob down a notch, DFA79 have kept Youre a Woman loud and nasty and ensured a cohesion and unusual degree of listenability-- something that the harder, better, and admittedly more authentic Lightning Bolt still hasnt been able to do in concert or on record.\nFrom the livid call-to-arms stomp of \"Turn It Out\" to the scraps and squelches and metalloid pathos of \"Romantic Rights\" to the strangely powerful teenage schlarp-turned-massive Oedipal joke of \"Going Steady\" (\"I have never seen you suffer/ I will never hurt you, lover,\" then, \"I will never make you suffer/ I will never hurt you, mother\") to the redrum rant of fiery first-half climax \"Blood on Our Hands\" (\"Theres blood on the shoes from all the people you stepped on\"), DFA79 waste no time on subtlety-- their lyrics and singular jingles are huge but fully exposed and vulnerable as all hell. Frustration and jealousy increase to painful degrees until the title tracks punk chorus (\"Now that its over, I love you more and more\"), an avatar of the albums bitterness.\nThis purge over, DFA79 end Youre a Machine with two responses to this draining ordeal. The first is the sex-furious, self-explanatory graphic fete \"Pull Out\"; the second, \"Sexy Results\", is about getting back to the prowl, and its the best dance-punk song since the late genres untimely death earlier this year. Theres the obligatory French introduction, theres cowbell, theres handclaps, and the lyrics put Nic Offers \"what did George Bush say when he met Tony Blair?\" hook to shame. And, at the end, a superfunk synth straight outta Chocolate City makes it clear that the DFA79 libido is back. Will the cycle of Youre a Woman repeat itself? Probably, but for now get out of the corner and just fucking dance.",

        "article_text": "Okay, Im done being a nice guy about this: If you dont like Blueberry Boat, I dont like you. Its no longer a matter of taste, other than the fact that I have good taste, whereas you, Fiery Furnaces-hater, do not. Dont have time to take in the full sweeping grandeur of Blueberry Boats 80 minutes? I have no respect for your calendar priorities. To those who find their multiple-movement symphonies and keyboard-fetish arrangements overcooked, I feel only loathing, utter disdain, and approximately one tablespoon of pity! And for the few of you that cannot handle the frenetic uber-medley that is a Fiery Furnaces live set, I want to make provocative documentary films about your inept and offensive taste and take them on the festival circuit.\nBut if my depraved fanboy rants and threats dont convince you, this here spartanly-titled EP just might. Dare you infidels bear witness as this collection of the Furnaces assorted table scraps easily outshines most bands main course? Not content to merely isolate the most accessible tune from their long players and ship a CD-R out to campus hundred-watts, Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger are prolific vinyl-pressers, releasing new or reinterpreted material betwixt and in conjunction with their albums. EP does the Soulseek virtual crate-digging for Furnaces devotees, collecting most of these odds and sods while wisely catching amnesia on their less-collectible Clash and Fall covers.\nI know of some misguided souls who find that the accoutrements of Blueberry Boats three-ring concept album circus overwhelm any songcraft talents the siblings Friedberger originally exhibited on Gallowsbirds Bark, and for these people my hatred burns only slightly less bright. Nevertheless, EP starts off with a trilogy of tunes that should lay this ridiculous claim to rest, restoring their most recent single to its original directors cut. Running a little over 10 minutes, the suite simultaneously reminds the doubters of the Furnaces considerable pop abilities, while not compromising on the Casio blitzes or thematic density of more recent work.\nIf \"Single Again\", in a slightly expanded take, remains a bit cold in with its jump-rope chant refrain and stiff drums, reinstated bridge \"Here Comes the Summer\", is the perfect thaw, showcasing the duos deft hand with electronic rhythms, guitar pedals, and swooning melodies. \"Summer\" seasonally segues into \"Evergreen\", the bands sweetest ballad to date, and the first that comes close to making the Carpenters comparisons more than just commentary on the Friedbergers slightly creepy sibling dynamics.\nTheres enough to digest in that opening salvo to fulfill the efforts modest title, but theres still a half-hour smattering of B-sides and remakes for dessert. A few (\"Duffer St. George\", \"Smelling Cigarettes\") swerve towards the ADD collage style of Blueberry Boats longer tracks, telling similarly intricate stories of infidelity, drinking, and gallivanting around London. Matthews imaginary Cockney accent takes the lead more often than on the full-lengths, whether on the tongue-twisting sea shanty of \"Cousin Chris\" or the Bowie piano-rock of \"Sing for Me\".\nMeanwhile, the complete reconstruction of \"Tropical Ice-land\" featured here is a taste of the bands Dylan-like compulsion to perennially revise the back catalog, expanding the sing-songy original in every direction, right down to a wonderfully gratuitous backwards-vocal verse. In the end, its perhaps this quality of perpetual evolution, best exemplified by their delirious live shows, that has me drawing Fiery Furnaces logos on my All-Stars-- few other bands of the indie world seem to have such mercurial aspirations.\nEP then comes off like a quick appendix to the bands work so far, concentrating their strengths in parts while elsewhere lovingly dumping the stray ideas that may not fit into their next conceptual flight. That it still manages to skirt the hazards of being a for-fans-only release only deepens my stalker-love, not to mention the accompanying abhorrence for all who dont see the light. Honestly, how do you people wake up in the morning; you pathetic, mouth-breathing [the remaining 1,000 words of diatribe deleted by Pitchfork editors, who cordially apologize to the readership for Mr. Mitchums unfortunate outburst -Ed.]\n ",

        "article_text": "Prolificacy can be a death knell for a less-than epochal rock band, so Stephen McBean decided to diversify. The fruitful Vancouver singer/songwriter has, over the past few years, spread his yield among no less than three bands-- Pink Mountaintops, Black Mountain, and Jerk With a Bomb-- each exploring slight but intriguing variations on reference-happy rocknroll. His latest undertaking is Black Mountain, whose self-titled debut full-length is a rollicking, wildly adventurous reconfiguring of 1960s and 70s nostalgia thats as duty-bound to the present as it is sympathetic to the past.\nBlack Mountain hits somewhere between Jerk With a Bombs stellar but more straightforward Pyrokinesis and Pink Mountaintops smarmy, sex-laden brand of vespertine blues-- only jacked up a good 20 decibels. McBeans voice is pleasant and instantly recognizable; having such an established songwriter behind a freshman outing is a tremendous advantage, and Black Mountain seem to know it. When the band arent venturing on plush, static jams, his coy bluesy vocals tether the songs in familiar melodic space.\nSvelte and upbeat, opener \"Modern Music\" stands apart from the rest of the album. Over jellybone saxophone and scattershot drumming, McBean and sidekick Amber Webber take jabs at \"another pop explosion\" and claim they \"cant stand all your modern music.\" Its a trite argument, but nevertheless one for which Black Mountain makes a compelling case. Ironically, \"Modern Music\" is the albums least anachronistic and, almost as if to spite itself, catchiest number. \"Druganaut\" fits better into the retro regalia the band revere, weaving a loose-limbed vamp that, besides a few simple chord changes, seldom varies but is gradually added to. The vocals dont drop until nearly two minutes in, but the gap is barely noticeable. After the vocals arrive, its into a series of haymaker guitar stabs and beefy drum fills, followed by a beautiful guitar feature-- spotted with ran-backward licks-- that exemplifies Black Mountains penchant for texture and sameness within traditionally peripatetic verse-chorus-verse structures.\nWhen Black Mountain evoke glue-sniffing shredders of yesteryear such Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin, their technique falls nearer to Galaxie 500 and the Velvet Underground, who forsook showmanship and dug deep in search of musics fundamental soul. \"No Satisfaction\"-- with its chunky strumming, honky-tonk piano, radiant plucked guitar and cheap-o sax-- most directly channels those aloof, technically slovenly forebears and, not surprisingly, is this albums best song. But theres nothing overtly sloppy about Black Mountain: Although it often wades in droning, repetitive passages, the album is impressively tight.\nSome may hear these shopworn melodies and clamor \"bar band.\" But if Black Mountain ever tried to make a night-to-night living in blues cover haunts, theyd do it by torching the stage and leaving patrons agog in WTF stares. The Vancouver quintet arent some cabal of slack beer-bellied crooners; they can play their instruments, they have multi-chord vocabularies and, perhaps most importantly, they know how to give their songs proper recorded treatment. Black Mountain has that golden must-be-analog sound, with the perfect amount of tarnish to make the songs feel lived-in without burying them in fry grease.\nInterestingly, Black Mountain are least effective at their most unpredictable. \"Heart of Snow\" resists structure, feeling out a plaintive acoustic strum before meeting up with a frail guitar and piano line, which meanders to a tense climax before erupting into a simplistic but captivating odd-time stomp. Unfortunately, the tension is drawn out as the band acquiesces back into a lugubrious Webber vocal passage, quashing the swelling momentum and rendering the eventual resolution less cathartic. \"Dont Run Our Hearts Around\" is the antithesis: the track is mercurial but calculated; its stilted operatic grandeur is a welcome bit of certainty. Orbiting the albums most generic and derivative riff, \"Dont Run Our Hearts Around\" starts with a clarion call-- a booming full-band hit or five-- then settles into a lurching unison guitar figure. The song seesaws for a bit, then has a mood swing and dives into a forlorn interlude, before picking up right where it left off and riding its central riff raw.\nBlack Mountain are about as referential as they come. But despite the obvious touchstones-- which, incidentally, fucking rule-- the band are affable and idiosyncratic enough to win over those who passed on recent retrofits like Comets on Fires Blue Cathedral or My Morning Jackets It Still Moves, and make those records admirers practically cream themselves. Stephen McBean may be playing it safe by partitioning his rep, but the consistency and breadth of his work is staggering amid so many once-and-dones.",

        "article_text": "As \"freak-folk\" began to hit a stride last summer, Devendra Banharts Golden Apples of the Sun compilation suggested a cogent introduction to the genre. A year later, Cripple Crow provides, in a sense, the loose-knit scenes strongest group effort to date. Banharts fourth album isnt a compilation, nor is it billed as a group project, but hes assembled such a rich cast of cohorts here, it feels more like the fruit of community interaction than the product of a lone singer/songwriter.\nThe communal vibe is hinted at by the albums artwork: Rather than adorning the cover with his usual calligraphic scribbles, Banhart offers a composite photo of \"The Family\" (a term he often ascribes to his musical friends), gathered beneath a large knotty tree and accompanied by the disembodied heads of smiling spirits. Sgt. Pepper is the obvious point of departure, though unlike the Beatles classic, there are no numbered silhouettes in the liner notes to decode the relative anonymity of the photo subjects. Fittingly, the only immediately recognizable figure is Banhart himself, crouching front and center, wings spread wide.\nThe artwork conjures Native America, an attribute Banhart seemingly alluded to in a recent email exchange, admitting that hes \"a little terrified at how white most of the people are,\" but reassuring me that \"68% of the people on the cover have Native American blood.\" Indeed, Banhart strives for ethnic diversity on Cripple Crow, boasting the highest concentration of Spanish-sung tracks of any of his albums (he was raised in Venezuela where Spanish was his mother tongue), and finding him moving further beyond \"freak\" territory and into a worldly blend of various exotic approaches. Banhart has always experimented with method and sound, but hes never before approached Cripple Crows expertise and variety. In all its obvious details, the album not only finds Banhart coming into his own as a songwriter and performer, but suggests future directions for the 24-year-old as well.\nHaving started out on primitive recorders and four-track machines, Banhart only recently graduated to proper studios, and Cripple Crow further increases fidelity, possessing a warmer, more pristine quality. His vocals, too, often draped in slight reverb, are especially assured and less flaky than on previous outings. And as mentioned above, an ensemble cast showed up to back him: Theres best chum Andy Cabic (aka Vetiver), Noah Georgeson (of Joanna Newsoms old rock band the Pleased, and producer of The Milk-Eyed Mender), and Thom Monohan (Pernice Brother and production whiz). The cast also includes members of Currituck Co., Espers, Yume Bitsu, The Blow, Feathers, CocoRosie, and others. Basically, its a traveling band of hippies excited about Donovan who arent afraid to rock.\nOn Oh Me Oh Mys \"Roots\", Banhart sang, \"I dont play rock n roll.\" All thats changed. Cripple Crow features an explosion of psychedelic R\u0026R stuffs. \"Long Haired Child\" maneuvers a three-pronged guitar attack-- Adam Forkners distorted noodling, Banharts wah-wah, and acoustic coupling-- backed with Otto Hausers drums and Jona Bechtolts percussion. \"Lazy Butterfly\" is memorable for Cabics closely micd backing vocals and a tambora sheen along with hand drums and guitars. And \"Little Boys\", which Banhart alleges is sung from the perspective of a schizophrenic Hermaphrodite, is divided in half by a mid-song bass change-up which shifts the song up from a sorta boring Oldham prom-dance lament to its sinister, surfy refrain: \"I see so many little boys I wanna marry/ I see plenty little kids Ive yet to had.\"\nJuxtaposed against a number of upbeat rock tracks, Banharts quieter, more introspective material often makes a stronger impact. \"Dragonflies\", a whispered duet between Banhart and Matteah Baim of Metallic Falcons, flutters by in less than a minute with a cryptically tender lyricism. Likewise, album opener \"Now That I Know\" is one of his most beautiful and controlled tracks yet. It finds him backed only by cello and his own guitar, in confessional: \"12 years old/ In [my] mamas clothes/ Shut the blinds and lock up every door/ And if you hear someones coming near/ Just close your eyes itll make em disappear.\"\nElsewhere, on \"Heard Somebody Say\", theres a sense of protest, with Feathers lovely vocals adding witch-hunt background layers. Banhart gently lays down the thesis-- \"Heard somebody say the war ended today/ But everybody knows its going still\"-- before winding around to the chill-inducing punchline, the easiest anti-war slogan ever: \"Its simple, we dont want to kill.\" Later, he tries out Dylan rhyme schemes on \"I Feel Just Like a Child\", while \"Some People Ride the Wave\" is Louis Armstrong with New Orleans toy jazz (\"some people write the songs that stay inside our souls\"); \"The Beatles\" lets it be known that \"Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only Beatles in the world\" before shifting gears into Spanish; Pangea and various fertility myths are given new legs in \"Chinese Children\"; and endless love song \"Korean Dogwood\" tells as thorough an elliptical story as Banharts tackled.\nBanharts ambition is apparent throughout, but at 22 tracks and almost 75 minutes, the album does stretch its legs too long. Though it feels like an attempt to document as thoroughly as possible his late winter retreat to Woodstock, any more experienced mystics will tell you that blanks, dissolves, gaps, and other ingredients for mystery couldve made it even richer. Still, Cripple Crow is undoubtedly impressive, vastly singular but entirely accessible, and an inspired listening experience where Banhart again proves himself one of the more talented and charismatic forces in modern music.\n ",

        "article_text": "Dan Snaith spent the first decade of his career attacking a wide range of genres with the intensity of an autodidact and the cerebral coolness of an academic. Back when he was still recording as Manitoba without fear of legal challenges from disgruntled punk veterans, he dissembled the IDM of the late 1990s and early ‘00s on debut Start Breaking My Heart before moving on to kaleidoscopic, colorful psychedelia on Up in Flames. From there, it was on to chugging krautrock and rich, melancholy ‘60s pop on The Milk of Human Kindness and Andorra, respectively; the 2010 LP Swim, cobbled together from leftover DJ set material and inspired by the sounds of deep house and contemporary club music, grew his fan base further. Despite the huge breadth of sounds they explore, these albums all share an essential playfulness and engrossing curiosity.\nIt’s always been enjoyable to hear Snaith dive deep into a new passion and emerge with a new record awash in the ecstasy of influence: finely detailed, in love with its inspiration, simply tuneful, and yet thematically complex. Our Love, his first album as Caribou in four years, is his first full-length that doesn’t come with a major shift from the sound of its predecessor. This is body music on the same general wavelength as Swim, albeit slightly warped and refined. The differences, then, are deeper: this is Snaith’s most overtly personal record to date, one that’s remarkable for its intimacy, openheartedness, and joy derived from basic human connection.\nOur Love is a quietly ambitious record, despite its modest title: in documenting Snaith’s personal vision of love, it seeks to render love in all of its universally complicated glory. It’s a warts-and-all depiction of a state of being that’s so often constrained to one or two facets in pop songs: obsession and disconnection, passion and jealousy, companionship and loneliness, all given equal weight. From the outside, Snaith looks the picture of domestic bliss, or at least stability—he’s been married for 13 years, and his first child was born in 2011—but many of Our Love’s lyrics hint at romantic trouble or marital discomfort. Nameless characters feel mistreated, are haunted by lurking suitors and bad memories, lament their broken love, look towards the future; when they’re in love, it’s with an intensity that verges on the maniacal. But it’s reasonable to conclude that the album’s songs aren’t near-direct transcriptions of events and feelings from Snaith’s life; instead, they’re extremes pulled from the necessarily complicated life two people build together over years and years, rich with joy but laden with baggage.\nIn any long-term relationship, there are moments of deadening melancholy where you feel like your organs have been put through an industrial shredder. It’s in those moments where you sniff at imagining your life completely different, or even with someone else—fantasies enabled by intense emotional pain. And then, somehow, things get better, and your heart is overflowing with love; you’re almost in disbelief, thinking, “How could I imagine a different life, even for a second?” Our Love captures the zig-zag between these two poles with an authenticity and honesty few albums manage, and the album’s excellent two singles, “Can’t Do Without You” and “Our Love”, focus on the latter sensation.\nThe kind of complex, slowly shifting relationship the album seeks to depict is mirrored by its own relationship to “dance music,” a term that’s broadly applicable to Our Love but awkward and inadequate upon closer examination. Snaith is an accomplished DJ, remixer, and producer, and he has a rock-solid grasp on the mechanics of the dancefloor: he understands how to get people moving, how to sustain intensity, and how small moves behind the boards can yield surprising results. A good example is the way he uses dynamic variation on highlights “Can’t Do Without You” and “Back Home”, using volume to make hooks hit that much harder. His 2012 record as Daphni, Jiaolong, was a dance nerd’s delight, a lean and brittle release forged by crate-digging and the need to churn out hours of material for marathon sets at European clubs, and its influence is felt in subtle ways on Our Love.\nThis album is glassy, warped, and largely digital where Swim was bold, bright, and decisively analog in places; there’s a warmth to it, but much of it comes from Snaith rather than his largely digital soundscapes. That said, Our Love only really glances at straightforward dance composition before choosing to shrug it off and take a different path. Most of the album is too slow and strange for the club, and its songs mutate in ways that are unexpected and offer different kind of rewards. The title track spends four minutes building to a strobe-lit, wildly pulsing frenzy, only to turn left into a lovely string outro arranged by contemporary maestro Owen Pallett, a longtime Snaith pal. The back half twosome of “Julia Brightly” and “Mars” are the two tracks that offer any kind of predictable dance-oriented pleasure, and even they’re a little off-kilter, with the former’s searing synth washes and the latter’s perky flute melody.\nThe key attribute is ultimately confidence. Our Love is a very assured record, from its unconventional, austere arrangements to its unrelenting focus and thematic consistency. This can be traced, in part, to Snaith’s solid collaborative circle: from respected advisors like Kieran Hebden and his wife to other artists like the aforementioned Pallett and Jessy Lanza, he’s surrounded himself with people he trusts and appreciates, freeing him to take risks and pursue a pure artistic vision. Pallett’s arrangements on the title track, “Silver”, and closer “Your Love Will Set You Free” lend a lightness to an album that sometimes verges on uncomfortable depth; Lanza’s winning feature on “Second Chance” is a welcome dose of female perspective on a record dominated by Snaith’s, her melody and fluttering voice taking the album from one person’s love to something larger.\nSpeaking of voices, Snaith’s isn’t half bad either: a reluctant vocalist earlier in his career, he’s improved by leaps and bounds since then, lending an imperfect humanity to these songs even if he’s not quite carrying them. His imperfect delivery makes plenty of sense in this context, anyway: you can imagine him warbling these songs to his wife, or turning them into lullabies for his daughter. It’s a subtle cultivation of intimacy, but one that works in driving home the albums central conceit: that the love you feel for your partner, and the life and family you can choose to shape together, can be transformative. It’s hard work, and it’s not always easy, but it pays remarkable and lasting dividends. It can change your perspective and the effect you want to have on the world, and Our Love is a worthy tribute to that messy, unbelievably powerful force.",

        "article_text": "Each subsequent full-length album that Flying Lotus has released seems to start with a personal connection thats grown more all-encompassing the further he gets into his career. From his year of birth, he moved on to the city he found his musical identity in, then out to the very structure of the universe, then deeper inside to the inner world of dreams and the subconscious. His fifth album, Youre Dead!, has the stated theme of the one thing every single human has in common, and just about every conceivable style of music is prone to address: the inevitability and condition of death, and how mysterious it really is.\nLike many people whove grown past 30 years old, Steven Ellison has lost some important people in his life. Specifically, they were artistic inspirations—from collaborators like Austin Peralta to influences like J Dilla to blood relatives like Alice Coltrane—formative catalysts that made his music and his life what it is. Coltrane in particular is frequently brought up as a familial connection to Ellison, but even if she werent his great-aunt, her meditative way of being in the world and putting forth music as a way of spiritual connection has carried through deeply into Ellisons own art, even when it appears irreverent or cartoon-ridiculous on the surface.\nThe title of Youre Dead! has that exclamation point for a reason, though. While the spirits of his friends, family, and peers weigh heavy throughout this album, the music itself is frequently light and sometimes shamelessly goofy, treating mortality with the irreverence and fascination of anything inescapable and unknowable. Theres little thats morbid and even less thats melancholy about it. In the context of coping with The Other Side, it all feels a lot more like a wake than a funeral.\nAnd consider the guests at this particular wake: pianist Herbie Hancock, likely legacy-minded as he continues to branch out and find new musical environments through his seventies; rappers Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, the latter whose insight towards death has the subtle heft of somebody whos cheated it while being well aware of those who didnt; guitarist Brendon Small, whose involvement in the gory cartoon absurdity of \"Metalocalypse\" prepped him well for an album that sounds equally informed by Slayer and Raymond Scott. Even the album art and promotional visuals, provided by the body-horror guro manga artist Shintaro Kago, revels in the idea of nightmarish evisceration and dismemberment rendered with an almost playful slapstick weirdness.\nThe theme sticks out as the most consistent element of Youre Dead!, since its far and away the most free-ranging FlyLo album to date. And yet the album doesnt sprawl out of control, maybe because it doesnt really have the time to: the whole record clocks in at just over 38 minutes, all jolts of sound and quick bursts of motifs. The fleeting cross-sections of chopped-to-bits fusion jazz strung together over the first five minutes—the ascendant cosmic drone and black hole collapse of \"Theme\", the fast-forward bop of Hancock collab \"Tesla\", and the careening hesher-Sharrock guitar licks of \"Cold Dead\"—flow from buzz-cluttered headspaces to spacious serenity so unexpectedly yet naturally that the seams never show. (The live-band personnel—including prog/jazz superdrummer Deantoni Parks, Ayler-school saxophonist Kamasi Washington, and ever-present partner/bass wizard Thundercat—do a masterful job in turning concentrated doses of high-speed, complicated chops into giddy bursts of euphoric adrenaline.) Kendrick Lamars virtuoso obstacle-course run through the dnb-tweaking \"Never Catch Me\" is the closest there is to a centerpiece statement of the album (\"Analyze my demise, I say Im super anxious/ Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it\"). But the tonal 180 into the buoyant, kind of tipsy/faded Captain Murphy/Snoop Dogg teamup \"Dead Mans Tetris\"—complete with a riff-echoing gun-cock collage and Street Fighter II K.O. SFX—is less of a jarring shock than a knowing counterpoint.\nFrom there, the albums remaining path through prog, fusion, IDM, and ambient all feels like a necessary comedown, shot through with moments at the precipice of chaos or deliberate ugliness (like the pill-popper nightmare of Captain Murphy croak-wailing through \"The Boys Who Died in Their Sleep\"), but still resiliently calm in the face of death. Ellisons once-sparse use of others voices is especially haunting at points—Angel Deradoorians breathily manipulated into weaving through wispy psychedelic soul like some minimalist version of Pink Floyds \"The Great Gig in the Sky\", or Niki Randa harmonizing at a distant horizon through \"Your Potential//The Beyond\". A lighter hand, even when its punching up bass drones or pushing through dense walls of complex instrumental interplay, makes the end-of-humanity choral hymn \"Coronus, the Terminator\" and the pull between intense rhythm and delicate melody on \"Moment of Hesitation\" feel infused with just as much wonder and awe as foreboding.\nTheres the idea expressed through Youre Dead!—intentional or otherwise—that making a lifes work with the full knowledge of death as the final limiting factor is a strong motivator. Flying Lotus has the notion that death should be the only limiting factor, and when hes put out a work that wrings beauty out of that very thing, whats the point of fearing anything?",

        "article_text": "I was introduced to the Beach Boys by my dads copy of Endless Summer. It was a two-record compilation from the mid-70s with all their hits, and for many years, was the only thing I knew about them. My sister also had a copy, so I could listen anytime I wanted. The artwork for Endless Summer featured a painted mural of big Beach Boys heads positioned in wavy jungle grass, and I spent hours looking at their grinning, bearded faces, imagining what kind of magic strangeness they were really up to behind \"I Get Around\" and \"Catch a Wave\". Later, I found a book about them, and again saw aged, beaten faces, with lots of hair, tacky, yellow pants and inappropriately overweight grown men. I hadnt even heard Pet Sounds yet, but was convinced these people were sad and interesting. And they usually smiled.\nBrian Wilson was the son of a songwriter. He was a naturally creative boy, though also prone to the same sunny interests and obsessions as his friends and cousins. He came of age just as thousands of other kids did at the time, learning that this place really could be the land of the free, home of love, peace, self-discovery and where everyone he cared about lived. He loved music. He still does, though at 61, despite the full mane of hair, he doesnt quite sound or write like the same boy who once scored the perfect soundtrack for an American summer. He was obsessed with George Gershwin and vanilla white harmony groups like The Four Freshman; he gave the world \"In My Room\" and Pet Sounds in return. Brian Wilson is touring Smile right now, with, they say, an unplugged keyboard and the same stiff onstage demeanor he showed during the \"Brian is back\" days. But then, performance has never been his bag.\nWilson abandoned Smile, his painstakingly planned follow-up to Pet Sounds, in 1967 because he had a nervous breakdown. He was emotionally unfit to continue. He was 24, only a few years older than I was when I bought my first bootleg copy of the music. If you want to know the precise details about how he broke down, there are dozens of accounts available (including mine here at Pitchfork). The short end of it has to do with drugs, growing pains, a new cast of friends, and a dysfunctional family. Brian had too much of all those things in the mid-60s; working on what was supposed to be the greatest record ever made might not have been the most realistic endeavor. Or maybe it would have been, had he surrounded himself with more understanding people. Or fewer drugs. Or better drugs. Or been able to keep his overbearing dad out of the picture. And on and on and on, until being a fan of the guy is more exhausting than it is rewarding. I really dont blame him for staying in bed for the 70s.\nI first heard Smile when I compiled my own version of it. The Beach Boys Good Vibrations box had just come out, containing the first \"officially\" sanctioned missing pieces of the album. I, like many amateur Beach Boys historians, used them, along with the best songs from the boots to make ad-hoc masterpieces. Id read how \"Our Prayer\" was supposed to go first, and it seemed naturally to segue right into \"Heroes \u0026 Villains\". Then I had to decide which versions to use. I strung together the single mix with the \"Cantina\" version with \"Do You Like Worms\" (its cousin), using a complex system of cassette deck editing techniques-- that is, I got really good at using the \"pause\" button. I put Wilsons solo vocal and piano performance of \"Surfs Up\" last. It ended my tape on a bittersweet note, which I guessed was in the spirit of what Smile would have been. I was wrong. Sigh. A lot of us were.\nDarian Sahanaja was right. Wilsons wife Melinda suggested that Brian take Smile on the road, and Sahanaja, keyboardist and backing vocalist in Wilsons touring band (aka The Wondermints) took up the sizable task of organizing the project. He dumped every Smile song and song-fragment he could find onto his laptop, took them to Wilsons house and watched as Wilson proceeded to phone no less an authority than original lyricist Van Dyke Parks when he needed help remembering lyrics. They hadnt really kept in touch for a few years, but Parks was at Wilsons place within 24 hours-- and would stay for five days-- to settle past scores and finish the lost record.\nThe trio made subtle changes to the music when necessary, and in the spring, Wilson headed to Studio One at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles to make his record. Just as hed made the original \"Good Vibrations\" and \"Heroes \u0026 Villains\" there, Wilson gathered his band, strings and brass to record the tracks, cutting the basic arrangements live while doing the vocals on the same tube consoles his old Beach Boys had.\nThe end result is a great album, albeit one more lighthearted than its myth would suggest. The music I hear is like round pegs in square holes; its just as insular and manic-compassionate as \"In My Room\" or \"God Only Knows\", but filtered through an amiable resolve. It sounds pleasant and assured, lacking the vulnerable, shy wave of hope drenching the old Beach Boys records. Yet, Wilsons voice sounds great. Its a bit lower, and his inflections have lost some subtlety over the years, but it still carries the weight of those angelic melodies (and when it cant, his band helps him out).\nAnd what of his band? The eight musicians who contributed to recording Smile with Wilson not only live up to the material, but also make possible what could not have been all those years ago. They are not the Beach Boys. There is no Carl Wilson. For better or worse, there is no Mike Love. But there is the music, and all concerned parties should be given some kind of musical amnesty award for managing to avoid the pitfalls of posthumous reworking and re-recording. This is no ghost record or bout of nostalgia. Rather than study the lonely, bittersweet passions of Wilsons youth, it celebrates the return of his muse and his gift to the world in the form of a \"teenage symphony to God.\"\nSmile begins, as had been expected since Wilson first discussed the album in 1966, with \"Our Prayer\", combined with a short piece called \"Gee\", which is, in actuality, an overture to \"Heroes \u0026 Villains\". The choir-like group harmonies of \"Our Prayer\" are as beautiful as they had been, originally tacked onto the end of 1969s 20/20, but in this case, reveal only the tip of an incredible iceberg. \"Heroes \u0026 Villains\" begins identically to the 1967 single version, and Wilsons band tackles it with gusto. Wilsons lead vocal sounds markedly gruffer in places, though more telling is his complete lack of hesitation in the phrases. He isnt as sensitive as he used to be, but he makes up for it by nailing every complicated counterpoint line and inner harmony voice.\nAfter moving through the songs \"cantina\" section, the band segues into \"Roll Plymouth Rock\", which Smile historians will recognize under its former title, \"Do You Like Worms?\". The galloping tympani is no less a disorienting force here than it had been originally, but Parks never-before-tracked lyrics (they are said to have been written during the sessions) suggest a clearer narrative rooted in manifest destiny: \"Once upon the Sandwich Isles, the social structure steamed upon Hawaii/ Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll over.\" This leads to \"Barnyard\", replete with animal sounds and more new lyrics about chickens and pigpens. The short, sad take on \"You Are My Sunshine\" (coupled with \"Old Master Painter\") precedes the climax of Smiles first third, \"Cabin Essence\". This is the same version as appeared on 20/20, though in this context is euphoric where it had been unexpected before.\nThe next section begins with \"Wonderful\", performed with harpsichord and understated orchestration (the brass, unfortunately, sounds synthesized) and Wilsons original arrangement of vocal harmonies. \"Song for Children\" emerges straight out of that, though fans will recognize it as the first section of a larger piece, \"Child Is Father of the Man\". That piece follows, and is more famous as the coda to the title track of 1971s Surfs Up album. Here, it wallows in ominous piano arpeggios and strings before introducing \"Surfs Up\", performed almost identically to Carl Wilsons 1971 production for the Beach Boys. Brian doesnt take the high harmonies on \"brother John\" anymore, but his voice is surprisingly nimble. Furthermore, Parks lyrics, once considered too abstract by Love, now seem perfectly in accord with the surreal Americana of Smile. \"Canvas the town and brush the backdrop.\" \"Carriage across the fog-two-step to lamplight cellar tune.\" \"The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne.\"\nThe album ends with a suite of Wilsons most idiosyncratic music. \"Im In Great Shape/I Wanna Be Around/Workshop\" form a kind of bizarre interlude for Smile, wherein Wilson pumps up the virtues of \"eggs and grits\" and wanting to be around when \"someone breaks your heart,\" over the strains of saws and drills. Things get odder as it flows in to \"Vegetables\", performed as a combination of the song from 1967s maligned Smiley Smile and the one heard on the Good Vibrations box. Wilson pulls out the \"Mama Says\" refrain (\"Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush em like crazy\") before moving into \"On a Holiday\". Fans will recognize this from various boots as just \"Holiday\", but Parks lyrics (check the sea-chantey rap (?) of, \"Not the rum of Carib scum/ Its Port tonight, drink up and come/ Un-weigh the anchor yank and we will party!\") are new.\n\"Wind Chimes\" is the same version as first officially appeared on the Good Vibrations box, but like so many others on the album, seems perfectly suited to this context. When the band rips in during the wordless (but for \"do-do-do\" and \"ba-ba-ba\") chorus, I strain to hold back cries of glee. I havent actually succeeded yet. This leads to the infamous \"Mrs. OLearys Cow\" (also known as \"Fire\"), the instrumental Wilson once thought so powerful as to cause fires around his city. It still burns with lysergic intensity, albeit refined and featuring none other than backing harmony vocals cribbed from Smiley Smiles \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\".\nSmile ends with \"Good Vibrations\", suggesting in no uncertain terms that Wilson aims to leave listeners grinning. Ill grin. Ill congratulate him. I wont wonder too much what might have happened had this been released way back when. And Ill let this record fall into the my still-churning impressions of Brian Wilson. Better late than never? Yes.",

        "article_text": "Consider Grizzly Bears cover of Yes \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", recorded some time ago and included on Sorry for the Delay, the mini-album collection of demos and early recordings released earlier this year. It finds leader Edward Droste struggling to meet the challenge of the songs strange angles and tricky construction with just an acoustic guitar, mostly by piling on intricately arranged vocal harmony. He slowed the song to half-speed, in part because half-speed is how Grizzly Bear like to do things, and in part because he needed the extra time to get the voices just so. Ten years ago such a cover may have seemed like an ironic appreciation of a corporate rock standard; that Grizzly Bear looked to the pop Yes back then is key, because it suggests that Droste is not afraid to get complicated and that he believes in the potential of widescreen sound.\nThis faith in something bigger is all over Yellow House, the bands second full-length and debut on Warp. Its not what you might expect from Grizzly Bear after hearing the apartment-recorded Horn of Plenty, the 2004 debut that was essentially a Droste solo record. Grizzly Bear seemed there like any number of post-Microphones indie bands stuck in the realm of lo-fi for lo-fis sake, ready to let pinched, tinny sound create intimacy when the songs themselves couldnt quite manage. None of this early Grizzly Bear material is bad, but it has a tendency to drift away completely once the music stops, and after the remix companion to Horn of Plenty came out, people seemed to lose interest in the originals.\nThats all behind us. Grizzly Bear are a full band now, Droste being joined again by Christopher Bear (on drums, the only holdover from Horn of Plenty), Chris Taylor (on electronics, woodwinds, and bass) and Daniel Rossen (who sings, contributes to songwriting, and plays guitar). Theyre still recording themselves, but theyve grown more ambitious and seem to have acquired some decent gear. The studio this time was a living room in Drostes mothers place near Cape Cod; their own private Big Pink is, indeed, yellow, and they apparently had a lot of time to think about arrangement. No question this grander sonic space is where they belong. Opening track \"Easier\" lays it all out: flutes, a descending intro tapped out on a rickety upright, sustain pedal to the metal, a smear of fake strings (Mellotron?), and then the acoustic picking and Drostes voice, clear and full-spectrum for the first time and sounding, finally, like it should.\nThe following \"Lullabye\" is the albums calling card, the production this time supporting a meandering tune that skips up the side of a mountain. Grizzly Bear exhibit here a tendency that recurs throughout the record, of showing the seams in their songwriting and dividing the songs into mini-suites through jarring moments that signal a shift in emphasis. A discordant guitar tears \"Lullabye\" in half, separating the tuneful opening, which sounds like a lost Disney tune written to send a rosy-cheeked imp off to sleep, from the dark tower that looms behind. The second halfs swirling harmonies and crashing drums evoke a Bob Ezrin-sized edifice that would leave a four-track recorder in a dozen pieces before the first brick was laid.\nSuch attention to detail and the larger well of resources improves Grizzly Bear at both ends of their range. The quieter songs sound better laced with effects and with the guitar and voice ringing true, and the climaxes carry greater weight. Another example of the latter is \"Plans\", which begins with a modest shuffle, picks up a chorus of whistling dwarves and some horns on loan from Tom Waits, and finally piles on some go-go nightclub percussion and laptop dissonance as it begins to buckle under its own weight. The imagination of its arrangement is impressive, as is the perfect 30-degree slope upward to its peak.\nThats one end of the spectrum. But then they slip in something like the regal waltz \"Marla\", which was written by Drostes aunt in the 1930s and carries the sparkling dust of its vintage. Grizzly Bear infuse the song with a palpable atmosphere, the live instruments mixing with indistinct sounds courtesy of Chris Taylors slippery electronics. He seems to be filling a role here similar to David Sitek in TV on the Radio, folding in odd noises at just the right moment to color the tunes in a very specific way. So \"Marla\", with its strings and accordion, suddenly opens up at the two-minute mark, when an echoing memory of a \"sweet\" big band 78 streams in for just a few seconds. \"On a Neck, On a Spit\" contains similar tweaks during its crashing instrumental break, with hard-to-peg wails that could be voices or could be strings but jack up the drama regardless.\nBeyond production, Grizzly Bear have stepped up their songwriting in every way, assembling melodies that proceed in a logical fashion but never sound overused or overly familiar. Yellow House is a much better record than we could rightfully have expected from these guys, better, even, than we could have imagined them making. And I find myself wondering how much further they might go, whether another layer of sheen and more production possibilities would push them to even greater heights. There are still moments here where the sound isnt quite all it could be. More money, a better studio, and who knows what might happen. And hey-- whats Trevor Horn going for these days? Ah, a question for another day. For now, we have Yellow House, one of the years best records.",

        "article_text": "How do we deal with personal trauma? After its over, what comes next? These are some of the Big Questions Seattle singer/songwriter Mike Hadreas addresses on his second album as Perfume Genius. Put Your Back N 2 It follows Hadreas overlooked 2010 debut, Learning, and it feels like a proper sequel to that albums suite of dysfunction and devastation. On his first album, Hadreas tackled subjects such as molestation, substance abuse, suicide, the complications of inappropriate sexual relationships, and the struggle for acceptance from those you love. The morose subject matter and melodic simplicity of Learnings piano-based songs drew comparisons to indie-pop artists like Stephin Merritt and Casiotone for the Painfully Alones Owen Ashworth. But Hadreas ability to set a scene and convey detail, which brought to mind Sufjan Stevens circa Seven Swans, lent the songs extra force. There were moments of impressionistic, synth-smeared beauty on that first record, but the overriding sense of despair and hopelessness could be overwhelming. On Put Your Back N 2 It, theres a crack of light coming through the darkness.\nHadreas is still exploring the more harrowing corners of human behavior. \"Dark Parts\" details the abuse his mother suffered at the hands of her grandfather; opener \"AWOL Marine\" takes inspiration from a tape of homemade pornography that Hadreas viewed, in which one of the participants admits, camera still rolling, that hes just trying to get medication for his wife. \"Floating Spit\" also deals with drug addiction, \"Take Me Home\" explores prostitution in the context of the need to be loved, while \"17\" uses a metaphor of a body stuffed into a violin, covered in semen, and hung up on a fence to shine a light on corrosive self-loathing. So dont let the whimsical album title fool you: If youre looking for something low-key to vibe out to, youve come to the wrong place.\nThe \"light\" the album allows has to do with how Hadreas approaches the material. He has a brilliant feel for poetic imagery (\"The hands of God were bigger than grandpas eyes/ But still he broke the elastic on your waist,\" from \"Dark Parts\", is particularly haunting), but hes mostly moved away from storytelling to explore emotional themes at their most fundamental. Put Your Back N 2 It is an album about love-- what happens when we feel sheltered by it, how we fail to love ourselves and the people around us-- but amidst the heartache and bruised tenderness, theres hope, too. Hadreas sums it all up in the hollowed-out torch song \"No Tear\": \"I will carry on with grace.\"\nFor all its violence, Back radiates warmth. Much of the beauty is due to the expanded instrumentation, from the swooning, countryish guitar bends of \"Take Me Home\" to the interspersed snare rolls on \"No Tear\". The brutal low fidelity of Learning is gone, replaced with clarity and sonic intimacy that, when paired with these rich songs, raises every hair on the back of your neck. The more expansive sound gives room for experimentation, from the submerged electronic percussion on \"Floating Spit\" (contributed by UK producer David Edwards, aka Minotaur Shock) to the robust and surprising full-band blast of \"Hood\". The latter, with its bloom-and-burst structure, is the perfect example of Hadreas growth as a melodic songwriter, having moved well beyond the the functional melodies that marked Learning.\nMany of these songs-- \"Hood\", \"All Waters\", \"Take Me Home\", \"17\"-- forego resolution and basically build tension and drop everything, in silence. Hadreas likes to steer clear of cathartic release, since in this world, there is no easy way out. On \"All Waters\", he begins singing in a low register and ends in his highest falsetto, as the song dissolves in wordless cries and frissons of far-away distortion. The song is a wish for a world where he and his boyfriend, Alan Wyffels (who also serves as his main musical collaborator), can hold hands in public without fear, and the lyrics (\"When all waters still/ And flowers cover the earth\") suggest that its not going to happen any time soon.\nMike Hadreas is gay, and many of the songs here focus on the issues that young gay men face in their lives (he referred to \"17\" in a press release as \"a gay suicide letter\"), even as Backs sustained exploration of love and hate has resonance for anyone. There is a lot of him in this music, the minutiae obviously pulled from a single persons life and experiences. But the album is less about confession as a form of release and more about trying to bring something positive into the world. \"I dont want it to seem like Ive been through more than other people...\", he says in promotional materials for the album. \"Staying healthy can be more depressing and confusing than being fucked up. But I want to make music thats honest and hopeful.\"\nWith so much recent conversation about marriage equality and gay teen suicide, and with the predictable election-year demonization of homosexuality, Mike Hadreas work is not only satisfying on a purely musical level, it also feels of-the-moment and above all necessary (its so topical, he found himself in the middle of a standards-of-decency \"family values\" battle earlier this year between his label, Matador, and internet-media titans Google and YouTube). Independent music has woefully few artists dealing with these issues and asking difficult questions, and doing so in a context that never forgets about the importance of songwriting. Thats a disappointment, but at least a handful of people like Hadreas are doing something about it.",

        "article_text": "West Coast gangsta rap has enjoyed a lasting revival in the wake of Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d city, with albums by Schoolboy Q, YG, DJ Mustard and others following its lead in advancing the quality and chart traction of narrative-intensive gang-life dispatches. good kid’s unblinking austerity went missing, though, as the infectious levity of Mustard’s airtight party anthems went national, inspiring even Kendrick to inch over to the sunny side with his studiously motivational comeback single “i”. The lesson of good kid—that you could make radio without catering to it—seems lost as L.A. revels in a renewed commercial relevance.\nLong Beach rapper Vince Staples is sick of cheery street rap. “If you listen to shit about niggas being in a position where they have no hope, there should be nothing at peace about that,” he said in a recent interview with Pitchfork. “There’s a way to do it where it’s listenable and likable, but it shouldn’t just be some happy stuff.” Staples’ own body of work rests on a nervous axis between expressive, imagistic wordplay and somber cynicism. There’s pessimism in the opportunism. There’s stress in the joy. At his peppiest—the chorus of “Feelin’ the Love”, perhaps, the closer on his just-released retail debut Hell Can Wait—he’s still waving at death: “Is you feelin’ amazing? Yeah I’m feelin’ the love/ Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done.”\nHell Can Wait is a reminder that living is another word for cheating death. It’s bleak and maybe exasperating, but the reality of the street is that babies gotta eat, jobs are scarce, and some people have to resort to tactics that risk death and imprisonment to make it through the day. There’s no wide-eyed good kid narrating the disorder in Staples city, just a realist making do with the available options. “Niggas from my home ain’t enrolled in the colleges/ Fuck a class, junkies hitting glass, get the money long,” Vince snarls on “65 Hunnid”. On “Screen Door” he balks at the popularity of imaginary gangsters, asserting that his own home was rawer than any Hollywood adaptation: “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG/ This ain’t no movie role/ Pops was off the OE/ Tripping, getting his Tookie on.”\nIn the middle of the EP Staples ire sharpens into an icepick. “Hands Up” protests LAPDs use of excessive force (“They expect respect and nonviolence/ I refuse the right to be silent”) in a diatribe Staples swears isn’t about Ferguson. But in a climate where surveillance cam and cell phone footage have revealed law enforcement bullying and violence against black bodies for a near-daily operation, “Hands Up”’s volatile objection to “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around whooping niggas’ asses” hits hard from coast to coast. Lead single “Blue Suede” is a curt rejoinder about gang violence being deadly too; the terse chorus—“New shoes with the blue suede/ Young graves get the bouquets”—folds a lifetime of adversity into just a few words, a series of damning images cataloguing the disintegration of hope. \nThat economy is Hell Can Wait’s guiding principle. Staples never wastes a word in exhibiting a hustler’s hard-won resilience, and he’s abetted by producers that buoy his stories without overwhelming them. Leading the charge is Toronto producer Hagler (best known for a co-producer credit on Drake’s “Trophies”). Hagler gifts “Screen Door” and “Limos” their hypnotic poise, but he truly shines on “Blue Suede”, which sounds like a trap artist’s rendering of the moment Dr. Dre thought to slap high pitched Moog lines over breaks, the resulting menace tracing a line of ancestry between L.A.’s riots and Raiders era and today. Elsewhere Lil Wayne associate Infamous effects a Nawlins death march for “65 Hunnid”, and Staples mentor and label head No I.D. outfits “Hands Up” with a guttural low end fitting of a song that could be considered a spiritual successor to “Fuck tha Police”.\nHell Can Wait is a debut for Staples, but it’s really a refinement, the end result of a years long search for the right producer that spawned a string of good but not always great mixtapes and loosies. Even a casual listener could hear the spark—Staples first fame came from getting the best of known mic terrorist Earl Sweatshirt—but his production values have finally caught up enough to push him past the scrappy sidekick division into the big leagues. In an era where signing to a major label can mean artistic regression, Vince Staples’ jump to Def Jam is a case study in the enduring merit of good old-fashioned artist development. The machine still works sometimes.",

        "article_text": "You have to hand it to Ex Hex: they didn’t waste any time. Around this time last fall, the Washington, D.C.-based garage-pop trio, lead by guitarist/singer Mary Timony, had yet to play its first show. The only real evidence of the band’s existence was an early mix of the song “Hot and Cold”, which Timony posted online, then quickly removed. Within a month, the band–which also includes bassist/singer Betsy Wright (Childballads) and drummer Laura Harris (Aquarium, Benjy Ferree)—had joined up with Merge. By spring, “Hot and Cold” had been remixed and released on a three-song single.\nAnd now, only a year in comes Rips, Ex Hex’s debut full-length. It’s the record of the summer, albeit one thats arrived two months too late—a collection of perfectly lean power-pop tunes that evoke Tom Petty and the Runaways while conjuring the unruly energy of contemporary mid-fi bashers like Thee Oh Sees. Rips sounds fine on headphones or at home, but it’s best enjoyed in the car where it’s possible to feel more perfectly tuned into the music’s steady velocity. The production is clean, but not polished, and the performances are tight. It doesnt sound like a record that was made in a hurry.\nAn active musician since the early ’90s—first in Autoclave, then in Helium, and then as a solo artist—Timony hasn’t gotten her due in the last decade and change. After two solo records—Ex Hex (2005) and The Shapes We Make (2007)—were met with muted reactions, she mostly called it quits on touring, popping up only sporadically in groups like Garland of Hours and Soft Power. In 2010, she joined Wild Flag, a bi-coastal quartet that featured former Sleater-Kinney members Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss, and seemingly caught a second wind. The band released one well-received full length and traveled extensively, but quietly parted ways last fall. Wild Flag was a potentially tough act to follow for Timony, partially because of the bands high visibility, which was given extra charge through the ascendance of Brownstein’s comedy sketch show \"Portlandia\".\nSo, it’s heartening to find that Ex Hex is, in a lot of ways, a better band. Wild Flags membership was split between D.C. and Portland and, perhaps unintentionally, the bands songwriting sometimes seemed to ping-pong between different sensibilities. Timony, Harris, and Wright seem more stylistically attuned to one another—after all, they have a closer geographical relationship, which enables them to practice regularly—and Wrights two contributions to Rips, “How You Got That Girl” and “Radio On”, both slot perfectly into the records uniform, neo-roller rink vibe.\nThe songs look back to ’70s radio rock with some amount of yearning, but Rips isn’t purely motivated by retromania. There’s a bit of environmental pressure built into this record: garage rock is adaptive music, where minimum resources can yield maximum impact, and it can thrive where rents are pricey and practice space is in short supply. You can write it with the people who are around, it plays well in a basement and also on a stage, and it’s easy to know when it’s working. If you can remember a garage rock song two minutes after it’s over, then it’s probably a good one.\nAll the genre demands is excitement, and Rips is definitely exciting. It’s stripped down, fast, and physical; the songs mostly revolve around scrubby, disappointing dudes and their failings, but the message is never maudlin or tragic. Timony spent years speak-singing, performing lyrics in a cool and detached tone that wavered in and out of pitch. But in Ex Hex, she’s developed a more overtly melodic delivery. As a guitarist, she’s playing a bit below her chops, but her solos are tasteful and on point, pitching up the emotional heft of a song once words wont cut it anymore.\nOver the years, Timonys own musical style evolved into something fairly distinct, a witchy-sounding and modestly mystical music that bred progressive rock and ’70s British folk with elements of D.C. post-punk. Some of that sound exists in Ex Hex, too, particularly in the modest pace of “Hot and Cold”, but Rips mostly finds the band walking away from Timonys established voice and pushing toward something more direct and energetic—embracing the past, but also blowing things up and starting again.",

        "article_text": "As a child I feared the day the world would be taken over by robots; these days I am seized by a much more potent fear that I am becoming one. Digital interfaces invade our imagination in strange, tangible ways, and with each day I spend in front of my computer screen, the red Gchat dots representing my friends and co-workers start to look more and more like HAL. Have you ever caught yourself trying to open a new tab in your brain? Was the Wikipedia blackout of 2012 as important a cultural moment as the New York City blackout of 77? Do androids dream of electric sheep, or do you not have an app for that yet?\n\"Post-internet\" is a term thats stuck all too easily (guilty as charged) to Grimes airy cyborg-pop, thanks in part to her endless quotability in acknowledging the digital worlds influence on her aesthetic (\"The music of my childhood was really diverse because I had access to everything.\") But Visions, the latest and best album from one-woman project of Montreal-based Claire Boucher, complicates the all-too-tidy \"post-internet\" tag by bringing into focus the many contrasts at the heart of her music: tensions between pop structure and diffuse atmosphere, between technology and the human body, between sensory-overloaded hyper-presence and transcendence. More solidly constructed and a lot more fun to listen to than anything shes put her name to so far, the electro cotton-candy of Visions is an inviting entrance into Grimes peculiar kind of bliss.\nOn her first albums, Geidi Primes and Halfaxa, Grimes buried pop impulses within textured muck and gloomy tones. But Visions finds Boucher mining not just the clean brightness of Aphex Twin-like atmospherics but also the immediacy of straight-up mall-pop: \"Vowels = space and time\" recalls nothing so much as Stacey Qs 1986 hit \"Two of Hearts\", while \"Infinite Love Without Fulfillment\" sounds like Boucher broke into the Apple store after hours and turned on all the display iPads to the same Lisa Lisa \u0026 Cult Jam video, rhythmically looped into something sublime. Some of Grimes reference points call to mind the experimental pop of Nite Jewel or some of the artists on the 100% Silk roster. But that music seems interested in obscuring pops immediacy or keeping a distance from the pleasure center, while Visions is an unabashed embrace of its source material, whether its K-pop, new age, or bubblegum.\nBoucher spends most of Visions  singing in a vaporous falsetto. She occasionally manipulates her voice (as on the steely, Transformers-jam \"Eight\") but mostly she just loops it, layers it, and cloaks it in reverb; there are moments when what shes doing doesnt sound too far off from what Julianna Barwicks music might sound like if she were interested in making a synth-pop record. The most common complaint Ive heard of Grimes come from people wishing her songs were more structured or hooky, or that her voice was more \"present.\" But-- never mind the fact that even the haziest moments on the record are anchored by melody-- this diffuseness is one of Visions most refreshing charms. Another oft-cited quote from Boucher the \"post-internet\" poster girl: \"Basically Im really impressionable and have no sense of consistency in anything I do.\" This is pop music for ambient fans, but its also a welcome change for anyone exhausted by post-Gaga pops tethers to artifice, theatricality, and skronky, turned-up-to-11 beats. To reach out and touch this music would be like putting your hand through a cloud.\nBut theres still that tension: Song titles such as \"Be a Body\", \"Visiting Statue\", and \"Skin\" are all testaments to Visions interest in the corporeal. When she sings the titular lyric on \"Be a Body\", it sounds like a nagging request to come back down to earth, while \"Skin\" (which has a sputtering sensuality, like a robot programmed to write a slow jam) feels even more revealing: \"Soft skin/ You touch me with it and so I know I can be human once again.\" Still, dont confuse these moments with any kind of new-agey, back-to-nature longing. One spin of \"Genesis\" is enough prove it: Post-humanism sounds like a blast.\nLate last year, Simon Reynolds described electronic musics response to our digitized world as a new kind of maximalism: \"a hell of a lot of inputs... in terms of influences and sources, and a hell of a lot of outputs.\" Thats an apt description for the music that Grimes was making before, but Visions showcases a streamlined aesthetic, resulting in a statement that feels focused, cohesive, and assured. Its simple enough to leave room for Grimes to grow, but this thing is so compulsively listenable its hard to come away from it wanting much more. Anchored to the digital imagination but unbridled from its skittish anxiety and concerns, Visions gestures skyward and beyond.",

        "article_text": "Although critics consistently nudge away the term, M83 create high-concept emo embossed with glittery snow angels, packing more synthy bombast than a Tangerine Dream/Mineral mash-up. 2003s Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts found the duo lazing on their backs in an Antibes field, watching stars and birds gently collide above green mountain tops. A pleasingly disembodied traipse through the French countryside, it was a lesson for anybody who thinks electronics have no soul.\nAfter saying \"au revoir\" to longtime friend/collaborator Nicolas Fromageau, Anthony Gonzalez goes it alone for album three, upping the drama (theres even a track called \"Teen Angst\") by layering electro-acoustic sci-fi backdrops atop often-campy dialogue (written by his brother), and then buoying it all with by a massive noir choir. From the buzzing nighttime Blade Runner skyline of the cover art to lyrics investigating car wrecks and dislodged brains, this is a mammoth collusion of synth gasps and distorted swirls, darker and more urban than its meadow-bound predecessor. If Gonzalez had gone ahead with only epic Vangelis modulations, Before the Dawn Heals Us would collapse under hollow ponderousness. Instead, he weaves a rock backbone into his tangerine-dream landscape with steady doses of highly effective live drums, gigantic post-MBV guitar, and sharper, more defined songwriting that helps to beef up the diaphanous symphony.\nAs those familiar with the group would expect, the icy Sigur Rós estuaries and incidental glaciers are ably glorious (as are the commingling interludes, tentative minimalist pairings with childrens voices, drifting sound-streams, and assorted channel surfs), but the larger success belongs to denser, more propulsive Kevin Shields-style hooks. Launching amid the urgent, ghostly sighs of \"Tina\" draped over a frantic drum/synth meltdown, \"Dont Save Us From the Flames\" is a coiled bit of apocalyptic pop compulsion with a J.G. Ballard storyline: \"A piece of brain in my hair/ The wheels are melting.\" Also built on rocknroll, \"Fields, Shorelines, and Hunters\" punts a precipitous Milky Way barnstorm of cascading feedback, drum buildups, and vocal cut-ups that lead into the even headier \"*\", which breaks orbit, uncoiling the previous tracks static energy with a patch of cathartic shoegaze glaciers from Saturn. (If you close your eyes, you might feel like youre levitating.)\nStill, however cathartic, these baroque bursts will more than likely overwhelm listeners pragmatic and/or cynical enough to reject the purple poetry of a John Hughes first kiss or a flitting cliffside Robert Smith love note. Its interesting that M83 dont receive the same sort of \"vainglorious\" tag as Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. Borrowing a page from Oberst, Gonzalez even opens the new record with a dramatic monologue: Languid drum rolls and chiming guitar/key-drifts pile up alongside a breathy \"They say I made the moon\" spoken by American actress Kate Moran, and culminating in \"raise your arms the highest they can, so the whole universe will glow.\" Which, really, is what Gonzalez attempts to do over the course of these 15 tracks. (As we later learn, closing your eyes could perhaps kill the sun). But where Oberst sounds out of place on Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, Gonzalez confidently weds ones and zeros, forgoing millennial chilliness for depth and color.\nWhich is one of a million reasons why Gonzalez is hard to frame. Not exactly a singer/songwriter or a dance-floor hero, Gonzalez is less about shoegazing or rock-boy myopia than the unbounded and gargantuan romanticism of a Vincent-Gallo-esque auteur: Entering the realm of M83 is less about Mogwai-esque post-rock than it is about going along with the ebbs and flows of Gonzalezs nearly faceless otherworldly flights of fancy.\nAs with most ambitious undertakings, there are dull spots and moments when the dialogue, sentiments, or other indulgences can try a listeners patience. But more often than not, Gonzalez strikes gold, admirably upping the ante from the subtler Dead Cities, Red Seas \u0026 Lost Ghosts and creating a massive, teeming, gaudy edifice that at its best dazzles like its own misty solar system. And even when it implodes, the unintentional fireworks of its collapse create compelling, stunning patterns that leak like colored ink through the nocturnal cloud cover.\n ",

        "article_text": "All these soulsuckers, theyre among us. Theyre stealing our privacy, our convictions, the very essence of our being, and leaving behind little more than a \"for sale\" sign and some vague, constant hollowness. In music, a dwindling whirlpool of funds only spurs on these parasites as they scavenge for scraps of humanity wherever ears can hear. Their thirst is real. And artists—those blasphemous and holy conduits for truth, liberty, and whatever else is missing from our lives—cant help but succumb. To last more than 20 years in rocknroll without sacrificing a lethal amount of ones soul requires a certain vigilance; to navigate around the pitfalls of both punk and ambition without tripping-up on either can seem just as hard as making a great album. But Spoon, one of the most stand-up bands of their generation, have figured all of this out. On their eighth album, they laugh in the face of leeches, defy gravity, suspend time. \"All they wants my soul, yes, yes, I know!\" hollers Britt Daniel, stretching every crevice of his 43-year-old throat. His message is clear: They cant have it.\nSpoons soul is theirs alone. Its not James Browns soul, and though Daniel was raised Christian in conservative small-town Texas, its not Gods soul, either. Its not exactly classic rock, not quite post-punk. Its not the soul of indie idealists blindly conflating modesty and virtue. Instead, this band is about capturing the unknown—those \"finer feelings,\" as Daniel once put it—and simply letting it float. Many of their songs are meticulously crafted, but they also breathe and break with crackling spontaneity. Theirs is an in-between soul happily seeking limbo as its own destination. Its manly in an old-fashioned way, but still scuffed-up and vulnerable. Its allergic to empty sentiment. Its smart but not eggheaded, tough but not dumb. Its Costello, Lennon, Can, and the Cure. Its all-knowing and hopelessly fallible, mysterious with a purpose. Its going to be crushed by life and love, and its going to endure. \nThey Want My Soul is the quintets most booming LP, eons ahead of their Pixies-worshipping beginnings and a far cry from the relatively small-scale charm of their early-2000s touchstones Girls Can Tell and Kill the Moonlight, as well as their self-consciously lo-fi 2010 record, Transference. The album sounds like a proper follow-up to Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, the clear-eyed 2007 LP where everything clicked into place and a restless band finally hammered themselves into stone. Some of the new records sonic forthrightness comes courtesy of two indie-hit-making producers new to Spoons world: über-pro Joe Chiccarelli, whos worked with everyone from Frank Zappa to the Shins to Jazon Mraz over the last 35 years, and psychedelic guru Dave Fridmann, whos helped turn unapologetic weirdos Flaming Lips and MGMT into festival headliners. Spoon, who also co-produced every song on the album, lie somewhere between those two poles—pop and outré—and the triangulations happening throughout They Want My Soul flow out unencumbered. These songs rip and burst and go.\nAs guitar rock continues its slow and inevitable transition into a bygone art, They Want My Soul pulls at familiar threads, fraying things to make them seem now, if not new. Theres an inherent nostalgia in the kind of alchemy Spoon are mixing up here, and the band is wise enough not to shy away from it. But instead of glowing in the light of good times past, They Want My Soul is constantly negotiating with the memories that make up our minds, trying to decide if theyre traps or blessings. \"Do You\" plays it both ways, starting off with Daniel wistfully reminiscing about vomiting on a curb—\"I was half out of a bag,\" he grins—before zooming out with a succinct world-weariness that comes from chronicling humanitys small giveaways for more than two decades: \"You tiptoe for ages, but lose yourself/ Flippin back pages, unbuckling belts.\" Daniel has talked about how he was a \"mean and ornery\" teenage outcast, and much of his subsequent years have been spent wearing-down that sharpness with empathy while trying to retain bits of its hard-nosed rigor. On the barrelling \"Rainy Taxi\", he has trouble living in the greys, describing an all-or-nothing romance he cant help but fall for. \"When you stand beside me I feel something stronger than I ever could,\" he says with hope, before the ultimatum: \"But if you leave you better run away for good.\" A happy ending is a boring ending.\nAnd who wants an ending anyway? \"Inside Out\" finds submissive contentment amidst a drift that hints at eternity. \"Theres intense gravity in you,\" Daniel lilts, \"Im just your satellite.\" And then the track willingly enters that ether as koi-pond synths twinkle in the distance, its tranquility tempered by the fact that Spoon have never made a song quite this pretty before. So have Spoon gone soft? Have they been watered-down by commercially-minded collaborators? Have they crushed the DIY dream by leaving indie utopia label Merge? They Want My Soul makes such questions sound about as petty and irrelevant as the thousands of bands that have come and gone (or come, gone, and reunited) since Daniel and drummer Jim Eno started Spoon in the months just before Kurt Cobains death. They didnt burn out. Theyre not fading away.",

        "article_text": "Andy Stott took his time getting here. The Manchester producer spent a good part of the last decade turning out solid tracks under his own name and under the alias Andrea. Though he always returned to dub techno, he flirted with a range of genres, from juke to house to dubstep, and some of his music was very good. But Stott never quite zeroed in on a unique voice. That changed in 2011 with the release of two short albums, Passed Me By and We Stay Together. Stott left behind the quicker tempos of dance proper, and slowing down allowed him to sink deeper into his music, where he found a new world of atmosphere and texture. Passed and Stay were heavy records that highlighted something new about the expressive power of bass. Dub techno, stretching back to its origins with the early-1990s Berlin project Basic Channel, tends to view the low end as a mysterious black sludge. Where bass in Skrillex-style EDM is a precision weapon, with drops punctuating the tracks and jacking up the mood in an instant, the bottom octave in dub techno is more of an enveloping presence. Its murkier, more oppressive, colder, something you wade through and push against. Which is why the inertia of the relentless 4/4 beat signifies energy whatever the tempo. \nOn his two 2011 releases, Stott found an unusual musicality in deep, foreboding bass. His music throbbed with the sooty remnants of industry and had obvious appeal for those interested in dark ambiance of any stripe; its all-consuming nature gave him a new audience beyond the realm of dance music. With his new album, Luxury Problems, he adds a few more wrinkles, and his music has become simultaneously more complex and more accessible. Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore (Stott met her as a student when she taught him piano), hes humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward for the producer.\nSkidmores voice is a versatile instrument in its own right, but Stotts looping and processing gives it even more flexibility. Though Luxury Problems has a consistent overall mood, the feel and structure of the individual tracks vary quite a bit, and the pieces featuring Skidmore find her singing pulled into all kinds of interesting shapes. The album opens with her in her most glassy and ethereal, as repetitions of her singing a single word, \"touch,\" float through space like soap bubbles. The \"ch\" phoneme is looped and becomes the hi-hat on the track, and gradually the sounds assemble themselves into a ghosted version of a conventional dance rhythm. But when Stotts machine bass pulse enters just under halfway through, we realize were in for a world of serious contrasts: \"Numb\" is delicate and gorgeous but has an undercurrent of menace, and the tension between these qualities is the records essence.\nIf \"Numb\" is Skidmore at her most spectral, \"Hatch the Plan\" finds her sounding more grounded, almost in the mode of a singer-songwriter. The choral-like layering on \"Plan\" brings to mind School of Seven Bells and even Throwing Muses. But its the longest track on the record and is purely instrumental-- mostly a deeply unsettling mix of bass churn and machine noises-- for its first two minutes. That it moves from pure soundscape to something close to a proper song is further evidence of Stotts confidence; none of these tracks feel like they have to be any one thing, theyre always growing and changing and defying expectations.\n\"Lost and Found\" has a similarly melodic approach, unspooling in a Middle Eastern mode and bringing to mind Dead Can Dance at their most subtle. We can hear Stott drawing lines between 4AD-style gothic new wave and dub techno, building bridges between sounds and ideas based on his understanding of the elements and moods that connect them. Elsewhere, on \"Expecting\", he goes further into abstraction, constructing an intensely dark and ominous atmosphere that bring to mind the ice-cold isolationist drone of Thomas Köner. The excavation of electronic music history takes a more unusual turn on \"Up the Box\", which plays with a snippet of what sounds like the \"Amen\" break. But the familiar splash of jungle snares and cymbals is transformed by Stott into something of his own own, as he mixes the tricky rhythms with his now undeniable bass signature, a groaning maw flecked with distortion that feels like its rattling everything within earshot. Stott has a rare ability to pull sounds from different places and fit them into his album conception.\nTwo records from the past offer antecedents for Stotts breakthrough: Luomos Vocalcity and Burials Untrue. Its not that Luxury Problems sounds like either of these releases-- the mood and textures are vastly different in each case. But theres a spiritual connection between the three, all of which found producers working within the confines of a specific genre of electronic music discovering a way to turn their music inside and out and broaden its appeal through the manipulated voice. But if Vocalcity was a digital refraction of house music and Untrue took early UK dubstep as a jumping-off point to express post-club emptiness and yearning, Luxury Problems is more internally focused, an evocative and immersive soundtrack for a sustained look within. Its the headphones album of the year from a producer with a long history who has come into his own.",

        "article_text": "Plenty of bands want to take you higher and even more are looking to get you down, but its increasingly rare to find a record that sounds good with a AAA guidebook and a few hours to get to god knows where, as long as its somewhere else. Despite the unabated use of adjectives like \"sprawling\" or \"sweeping\" or \"epic,\" the indie road trip album has become something of a lost art, with bands mostly forgoing dense, pent-up instrumentation that slowly unfurls and releases-- you know, that lonesome crowded sound. You could blame it on so many bands being from autophobic NYC, or that the Pacific Northwest gods of indie are still going too strong to already be a primary influence, but neither would explain New Yorks Cymbals Eat Guitars Why There Are Mountains. While theres plenty of geographical signifiers on their debut, its almost topographic in its approach, without hooks and choruses so much as map-like layouts of mountains and sloping valleys.\nSix-minute opener \"...And the Hazy Sea\" has  Why They Are Mountains sounding like it could immediately implode, kicking off with the kind of cataclysmic blowout Built to Spill used to get to in a few minutes less time. Occasionally adding reverbed guitar and electric piano to give an eye-of-the-storm calm, the band reaches about six different crescendos; its less showy theatrics than Cymbals Eat Guitars just packing a lot of ideas into their songs. Its tough to consider structures this unpredictable to be templates, but upon hearing the subtle instrumental shifts of \"Indiana\" evolving from noise-rock interlude to a horn-led piano waltz, you locate a certain pretzel logic in these songs-within-songs. Yelpy and adenoidal, bombastic and yet unkempt, you could pretty much slap a sticker on this thing saying \"RIYL: indie rock.\"\n\"Some Trees (Merritt Moon)\" emerges from the feedback exhaust of \"...And the Hazy Sea\" into two minutes of tightly coiled post-punk dance and strangulated, sugary hooks. At first an environmentalists lament of suburban sprawl, a much more sinister effect of deforestation is revealed-- \"I was thankful for the mystery/ But by the time the girl had hanged herself/ I could have looked out my back window and watched her neck just snap.\" CEG are rarely as dark as they are on \"Some Trees\", but besides a sound engineer, the group also shares with Modest Mouse a tendency to turn supremely stoned observations into startling lucidity.\nWhy There Are Mountains  gains as much impact from its quieter moments, especially \"Share\", which parlays queasy, whammy-bar shoegaze atmosphere into a defeated, yet regal procession of horns. As its followed by \"What Dogs See\", four minutes of echoing rubble and near spoken-word mumbles, it initially seems like a pokey bit of sequencing, but the song evolves into a prelude to the deceptively bouncy \"Wind Phoenix\", which turns personal devastation into a sing-along. The scattered lyrics could pass for a whimsical recollection of an Indiana youth spent watching Notre Dame football and listening to Sub Pop until you focus on the songs macabre laments.\nWhats most admirable about this sophisticated self-released debut is Cymbals Eat Guitars willingness to think big with gestures that shouldnt fly in the hands of a young band, instrumentally or thematically. Occasionally, albeit rarely, it leads them astray, as in the closer \"Like Blood Does\", where the group dawdles a bit too long before reaching its arresting conclusion. But thats a minor quibble considering how Why There Are Mountains ends up being like any great result of wanderlust-- here, the journey is the end not the means; fortunately, that gives Why There Are Mountains astounding replay value.",

        "article_text": "Frankie Rose spent a few years kicking around the Brooklyn jangle-pop scene before striking out on her own: As the most charismatic member of Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, and Dum Dum Girls, she was a reliable bolt of onstage electricity enlivening the often noncommittal presences around her. It was pretty clear, even then, that she was eventually destined for bigger things, but her first solo record, recorded under the name Frankie Rose and the Outs, still felt constrained by a reflexive sort of cool-kid slouch. Between that record and Interstellar, she has dropped the pretense of a backing band entirely, and is recording simply as \"Frankie Rose.\" The implicit point is clear: This time around, shes going for it.\nThe first moments of \"Interstellar\" make this point immediately. The song opens on a cool-blue vista of synthesizers, a transportingly vast sound of the sort Frankies never made before. When her voice enters the mix, cooing about interstellar highways and moon dust, its piped from above, passed through a series of filters so until she slightly resembles the Laurie Anderson of \"O Superman\". A minute in, a massive, Valhalla-pound drum hit resounds, the synths explode sideways, and Frankie hurls us down a flume ride of descending vocal harmonies. Its the most colorful, thrilling music of her career, and as grand a pronouncement as one can make that were not doing things the same way anymore.\nInterstellar is a big, second-album leap of faith into deeper waters, a sparkling synth-pop record that wants very badly to mean something to dreamy, hyper-emotional twentysomethings. For her model, shes taken the impression of some of the dreamiest, most hyper-emotional records of her youth. The production on Interstellar is gorgeous, and clearly modeled on the Cures big, panoramic pop records, like Disintegration: booming-canyon drums, acres of spannable horizon. The drum beat that opens up \"Know Me\" is virtually identical to that of \"Close to Me\", and the silvery guitar leads on \"Gospel/Grace\" are pretty much mimeographed from \"Plainsong\". But although Rose indulges pretty heavily in the Cures primary colors, she paints something distinctly her own with them. The world of Interstellar is a vision of paradise as lifted from the front of a Trapper Keeper: air-brushed, pastel-hued, and gloriously vivid.\nInterstellar is not a thematically rich experience-- it basically has one single invitation, and that is to swim with Frankie in the glorious bath of echoes shes drawn for herself. \"All that I want is a pair of wings to fly/ Into the blue, a wide open sky/ Show me your scars, Ill show you mine/ Perched out of the city on a pair of power lines,\" she sings over and over on \"Pair of Wings\", and you can hear this yearning for escape echoed in the records every upward-spiralling note. Her singing has always been breathy and modest, but on Interstellar, her voice seems to mist on contact, even when shes swirling herself into a prismatic mini-choir of Frankies. On her record, shes just another celestial body orbiting larger ones.\nThe resulting album isnt one you actively explore so much as bask in gratefully. The longer I spend immersed in it, the more I appreciate its details: the haunting, truncated piano chords that the melody of \"Apples for the Sun\" clumps around, or the way Frankies voice melts into and becomes one with the bloom of synthesized strings in the last minute of \"Gospel/Grace\". Rose is tapping the same slightly shameless clear eyes/full hearts well of teen melodrama that sourced M83s Hurry Up, Were Dreaming, and she demonstrates the same kind of focus and vision in carrying it off. On Interstellar, she transports us further and takes us higher than she ever could have as the drummer of an indie pop revivalist band. Amen to breaking free of sonic restrictions when they outlive their usefulness.",

        "article_text": "The opening track on Fleet Foxes debut EP is the perfect introduction to this Seattle band, whose carefully fashioned songs reward more active listening than your typical indie-roots outfit. \"Sun Giant\" begins with their soft harmonies reverberating in what sounds like a cathedral space. With no accompaniment, their sustained a cappella notes fade slowly, adding gravity to this hymn of contentment: \"What a life I lead in the summer/ What a life I lead in the spring.\" The only other instrument is Skyler Skjelsets mandolin, which enters late in the song playing a delicate theme as singer Robin Pecknold hums quietly.\nThe Sun Giant EP-- sold on tour and digitally through Sub Pop, with a proper release forthcoming-- contains familiar sounds, but Fleet Foxes make something new and special with them, following their own musical whims as closely as they follow tradition. (Maybe more closely.) These five songs-- modest but never spare, atmospheric but never as an end in itself-- change shape constantly, taking in elements of classic rock, church music, old-timey folk, and soundtrack flourishes. Already mistaken for Southern rock (theres not enough boogie in Nicholas Petersons drums for that), Fleet Foxes will bear repeated comparisons, both praising and disparaging, to groups like My Morning Jacket and Band of Horses, but those connections are based on superficial similarities like geography or the heavy use of reverb. In fact, Fleet Foxes touchstones are much more diverse than that-- and not necessarily so contemporary. Until recently, their MySpace page listed Judee Sill, Crosby Stills \u0026 Nash, and Fairport Convention as influences, although now it reads \"not much of a rock band.\" Thats not especially true. You could also make a case that Fleet Foxes demonstrative harmonies recall Fleetwood Mac; that their rearrangement and recombination of traditional styles hints at the Band or, more recently, Grizzly Bear; that their short, evocative instrumental phrasing bears similarities to Pinetop Seven.\nSuch comparisons accompany the arrival of most young bands, but Fleet Foxes songs inhabit a very specific, very rural space thats as much a product of how these songs are assembled as it is of how they sound. Like a novelist writing intricately winding sentences, the band craft hummable melodies that never quite go where you expect, but sound neither manipulated nor directed. After the quiet title track comes \"Drops in the River\", which builds gradually as the band patiently add instruments-- strange ambient clattering in the background and simple floor toms in place of a drum kit, accentuated with tambourine and a snaky electric guitar. Halfway through the song, Fleet Foxes reach a dramatic peak, and their next move is surprising: The music ebbs momentarily, as if to build anew through a second verse, but then picks up at that same dramatic level. Like the rest of the EP, \"Drops in the River\" possesses an intriguingly blunt concision, as though Fleet Foxes have no time for the luxury of long, slow crescendos or meandering jams. They focus their arrangements finely, emphasizing Pecknolds rustically impressionistic lyrics as much as their organic and inventive sound.\n\"English House\" and \"Mykonos\", the longest and most obviously \"rock\" songs, comprise the EPs rising action and reveal more of Fleet Foxes range. The former is a graceful downward rush of guitars and percussion, with a falsetto chorus trimming the music like Christmas lights in the rafters. \"Mykonos\" doesnt travel as far as its title suggests, but thrives on the tension between Pecknolds wordless vocal intro and the bands intricate harmonies. Of course, it careens off in new directions. \"Brother, you dont need to turn me away,\" Pecknold pleads, bringing the song to a dramatic standstill. Then the band just runs away with the song again.\nThe Sun Giant EP ends with Pecknold alone once more, singing \"Innocent Son\" with only a few brusque strums as accompaniment. With only the sparsest elements, he turns the song into a sort of rough county-road soul, his voice unceremoniously fading out on the final words. This song, and the others here, reinforce the impression that Sun Giant is more than a tour souvenir or a promotional teaser for a proper release. Its a sovereign work: a statement EP, supremely crafted and confident.",

        "article_text": "The classics kid in me craves noble grandeur-- craft-happy shit with more than meets the rods and cones, less is always more (except with clothes), suggestive-seductive vs. the once-off gunfuck. Full-on body musics great, sure, but so is porno, and with that shit Id much rather wax new flesh than drag my stylus off the same old 10-second loop. Same time, Intelligent Body Musics as much a nightmare as Intelligent Anal, both a prefab excuse for pleasure-lack. So were stuck in this immediacy=better rut, when really the best stuff cross-genre-- cross-platform, cross-media-- has instant funk, but with enough tricks for prolonged appeal.\nLiking We Are Monster is easy. Isolée arent bangers but they groove hard enough; melodies are pretty but most times we have to look for them (no lead vox or riff jihad per se). Tracks arent afraid to be songs (\"Face B\"), and songs arent afraid to be tracks (\"Jelly Baby / Fish\"). Everythings pleasant in other words, non-threatening like the cutesy-est Morr Music lullaby, but physical enough that you could get away with some great normal-person dancing. There are guitar sounds on a few tracks too, if thats important (\"Today\" sounds like \"Do You Realize?\"), and traceable horizontal A--\u003eB trajectory in songs with actual movements and quantifiable progress. No need for all the \"its about size! its about expansion!\" apologies people make for their favorite loops.\nAs for loving this record-- letting it problematize itself with spins and learning to let it offend-- well, We Are Monster has the depth if you have the time. Yep, heres a fun record thats a work-for-it, in-the-details record, too. Behind the choked-vocals groove of, say, \"Enrico\" are countless micro-surprises (check how the kicks break down differently each turnaround, or how the downbeat finally drops deceptively mid-bar instead of on the loops head), structured flips with chess-like anticipation (the guitar-like scratches function percussively at first, their color stuck in overtones until the song needs them in full), and avalanching momentum not from Isolée stuffing ideas half-baked, but from letting the seeds of lines grow, branch out, and tangle. Not sure we can talk of \"Golden Age IDM\" or even \"Golden Age Techno\" yet, but something like the Copeland-does-Glam gem \"Schrapnell\" seems so effortless, breathes so carefree, years from now crits might accuse it of sounding timeless-- maybe even of being so.\nThe rest of the tracks have their own self-revealing logic, obeying the beat but never in dependency to it. Honestly, you could drop the drum sounds off \"Madchen mit Hase\" and the song would still kill a floor, the rhythms of its composite parts boasting good spine, serving the melody before decorating the dancefloor. No gestures incidental; the simplest blip plays for both a greater purpose and its own passing punchline. Even the second-trackiest number, \"Do Re Mi\", fronts a perplexing guitar jingle so it can alley-oop with drones of the same progression and a goofy italo-disco melody of 180-degree mood change, then the polar-opposite timbre. These songs are well-poised and well-developed and terrifyingly autonomous-- so much so Im afraid theyre no longer Isolées anymore. On that note: Yeah, while I wish We Are Monster was an Album w/Overarching Concerns and Worldview, not just a Bunch Of Sweet Similar-Sounding Stand-Alone Tracks, Im also convinced that in fact, a worldview is there, and probably an exciting one at that. I just havent cracked one yet-- or just wont be able to.\n ",

        "article_text": "In March, a 12-year-old letter Fiona Apple once wrote to a young gay fan named Bill surfaced online. \"A person who loves is a righteous person,\" read the supportive note, \"and if someone has the ability and desire to show love to another-- to someone willing to receive it, then for goodness sake, let them do it.\" The message was warm, thoughtful, sincere. But its presentation was just as important. It was written-out by hand, on lined paper. And there were Apples pen marks-- a distinctive blend of print and cursive-- legible yet casual, perfect in its imperfections. The letter provided an instant reminder of the singer-songwriters lasting appeal, why she can take six or seven years between albums and return to even-more-rabid followers. Unguarded honesty doesnt go out of style. \nThis is especially true in 2012, when major artists can get so caught up in \"brand management\" and web-based \"social engagement\" that the core of their art-- emotion, intelligence, meaningful connectivity-- is sometimes lost amidst bottomless scrolls. Being able to slice through the bullshit is arguably more coveted now than when Apple did just that during her ferocious acceptance speech at the 1997 VMAs. Another famed modern truth-teller and award-show crasher (and noted Fiona fan), Kanye West, has been able to harness technology, the media, and his own public projection by constantly negotiating with all things fresh and new. Apple doesnt really care about all that. In interviews from both 2000 and 2012, she claimed to not listen to any new music whatsoever, and when she recently sat down with Carrie Battan for a Pitchfork interview, she referred to Google as \"this whole Google thing,\" like an overwhelmed grandmother. On her entirely acoustic fourth album,  The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do, the 34-year-old makes herself heard with her voice, her words, her piano, and not much else.\nThis is the most distilled Fiona Apple album yet. While her celebrated previous work was marked by eclectic musical flourishes courtesy of producers including Jon Brion and Mike Elizondo, The Idler Wheel is fearlessly austere in comparison. She worked with touring drummer Charley Drayton on the album, and his touches are light and incisive. Speaking of the records signature clattering percussion-- including thigh slaps, truck stomps, and \"pillow,\" according to the credits-- Apple associated the homemade sounds with an increased freedom: \"I just like that feeling of: Im in charge, I can do whatever I want.\" And this musique concrète approach is not random. Every single waveform is pierced with purpose, from the muted heartbeat thumping through \"Valentine\" to the childlike plinks popping around the uncharacteristically optimistic \"Anything We Want\" to the chugging factory sounds that give \"Jonathan\" its uneasy rhythm. On the oddly life-affirming \"Werewolf\", a banjo shows up, plucks exactly four notes, and then dips out, never to return. \"You made an island of me,\" she belts on that song, and The Idler Wheels spareness does lend it an insular loneliness, one thats divorced from the outside world while also being intimately in-tune with its basic realities. As Fionas self-drawn album cover suggests, the inner workings of her mind can be scary, ugly, and head-splinteringly vivid.\n\"Werewolf\" also features the albums most jarring and powerful found-sound moment: just as the self-conscious ballad climaxes, the roar of children screaming on a playground enters, adding an uncanny mix of dread and wistfulness. The fact that Apple was inspired to insert the yells by a classic-movie battle scene that was running when she first played the song only adds to the samples ambiguity as well as its spontaneity. Much of the album involves Apples constant struggle between naivety and cynicism; on opener \"Every Single Night\", she sings, \"I just wanna feel everything\" and \"every single nights a fight with my brain.\" The saga can turn into lacerating theater, as on \"Regret\", which, with its mechanical beat and ominous, monk-like ambience, could nearly pass for a track on Nine Inch Nails The Downward Spiral. The song also features the most brutal hook of Apples career: \"I ran out of white doves feathers to soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth every time you address me,\" she bellows, tearing her throat apart in the name of pure vengeance. And while shes undoubtedly one of our foremost talents at the art of the kiss-off, the blame for Apples woes is a bit more spread out now. \"How can I ask anyone to love me,\" she offers, \"when all I do is beg to be left alone.\" \n\"Left Alone\" is nothing short of a vocal masterclass. It has the singer going from the verses rap-like cadence to the hooks curlicue jazz stylings to the operatic long notes of the bridge-- notes that slowly curdle underneath their own exasperated weariness. This makes sense considering Apple is a child of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and hip-hop, a songwriter whos spiking the Great American Songbook with todays mirror-upon-mirror confessionalism. Shes able to convey more with a quick, original turn of phrase-- \"my woes are granular,\" for one-- or an in-the-moment scrunch of the face than many pop stars are able to muster with 100-foot screens and volcano pyrotechnics.\nIts an old-school approach, though it rises well above mere sepia Instagrams. Instead of being far-off and dreamy, her throwback moves are the opposite-- intrusive, corporeal. This is not background music. It demands attention. \"Look at! Look at! Look at! Look at me!\" she pleads on \"Daredevil\", a knowing admission of her self-destructive tendencies. But even after being thrown into the media spotlight at a young age, and having to deal with crippling doubt, Fiona Apple didnt go boom. Shes still here, brave enough to indulge in raw emotion and smart enough to make those feelings carry.",

        "article_text": "Phil Elverum, the force behind the Microphones and Mount Eerie, lives in Anacortes, Wash., a small town of just under 20,000 people about 64 miles outside of Seattle. As he told Brandon Stosuy in last weeks Pitchfork interview, he recently took an extended break from touring to record two albums there, and he speaks of it as a calming, recentering time: \"The songs and the ideas came from a more slowed-down attention to this particular place, this town, walking from my house to the studio and back every day,\" Elverum told him. The second album of the pair, to be called Ocean Roar, will be out later this year; Elverum calls it \"more challenging and weird and darker and heavier.\" For now, however, he has given us Clear Moon, an album that makes a vast, cool sanctuary of itself and quietly beckons you in. Inscrutable and transfixing, plainspoken and unknowable, it feels like a collection of secrets Elverum has cupped in his palm to pour directly, and privately, into your ear alone, a rich meditation on the many meanings of the word \"home.\"\n\"I go on describing this place/ And the way it feels to live and die\" is how Elverum summarizes his task on Clear Moon in the albums opening song, \"Through the Trees, Pt. 2\". The line also neatly serves as any great writers ultimate mission statement: Your backyard is a gateway to the universe, if you look hard enough. Note the song titles tricky numerology: We seem to be joining Elverum in the middle of an ongoing, possibly endless cataloging task. (Elverum, of course, has a documented fondness for \"Pt. 2s\".) The song names all have the quality of bullet points in some strange thesis: \"The Place Lives\", the second song, is followed by \"The Place I Live\", and it feels like Elverum is using these phrases to draw some obscure distinctions that are very important to him. \"If I look/ Or if I dont look/ Clouds are always passing over,\" he sings on \"The Place I Live\". Its a statement that can read as perversely comforting or profoundly depressing-- the universe doesnt disappear when I blink, on the one hand, and the universe wouldnt blink if I disappeared, on the other. Elverums sighed inflection cradles both of these meanings with equal gentleness.\nThe albums sound, meanwhile has the misty-but-tactile feeling of a sense memory. Every sound echoes from side to side of the mix, and the effect isnt so much \"panning\" as it is a shimmering omnipresence. Acoustic guitars, light keyboards, muted but persistent drums-- the sounds on Clear Moon feel like anxious, living beings that are trying to whisper something to you that you dont want to know. \"Lone Bell\" is the moment where Elverums existential quandaries suddenly sprout fangs and grow frightening: Sharp horn blats and insistently hammering guitars evoke fight-or-flight dread, danger, encroaching panic. The bassline keeps crawling up a modal minor scale in the center of the song, posing the same uneasy question, over and over.\nWhat that question is remains deliciously out of verbal range, but Clear Moons brought a sharp memory into relief for me: It reminded me of standing outside of my house as a child, on a cold night. From the street, the house, broadcasting its fragile comfort out to me, looked a little unreal: Elverum calls a song on the album \"House Shape\". You know you will be allowed back in, but you stand for a prolonged moment, looking into the lit windows, and tasting something uneasy in your mouth. Clear Moon summons, inhabits, and distends this moment for 42 consecutive minutes.",

        "article_text": "It makes sense that Dum Dum Girls thrive in short form. Though theyve turned into a versatile band comfortable in an array of styles, their roots are in garage rock, a sound that has a long history of mining the potential of brevity: Its a genre built on a foundation of singles, whose holy text is aptly titled \"Nuggets\", and whose philosophy is summarized by a song that went \"I hope I die before I get old.\" Though Dum Dum Girls latest EP, End of Daze, has a handful of gothic influences, its all-killer-no-filler concision feels like a tribute to the spirit that theyve have been riffing on since their debut, I Will Be. Unhurried but not a beat too long, End of Daze is a confident and comprehensive showcase for everything Dum Dum Girls do well, from luxuriant, moody ballads to driving, melodic guitar pop-- and after 18 minutes, it punches the time clock like somebody who just declared checkmate: Your move, every other band trying to sound like this.\nThis isnt the first time an EP has marked a turning point in the Dum Dum Girls run. Last years terrific, four-song He Gets Me High EP introduced a newfound Chrissie Hynde-like depth to Dee Dees voice and new-car glimmer to the Girls formerly lo-fi sound. It was a collection of cheery, upbeat songs about infatuation, except for the closing track -- a cover of the Smiths classic \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\". Bold is the band that thinks it can bring something new to the song thats launched a million mascara tears, but Dum Dum Girls pulled it off in grand style. Sandys kick drum towered 10-stories high and Dee Dee sold the tracks jet-black drama, uttering her chilling delivery of \"I want to see people and I want to see life\" like a member of the walking dead. Now, on End of Daze, theyre now penning some dark gems of their own.\n\"Ive dreamed a death/ Its mine tonight,\" Dee Dee drawls on the opener \"Mine Tonight\", which smolders slowly and purposefully for a minute and a half before bursting into a panoramic blaze. Like Only in Dreams, Daze is an exploration of the feelings triggered by the recent death of Dee Dees mother. But while many of the songs on Dreams painted grief with a palette of simple descriptors and easy rhymes (\"Theres nothing to say/ At the end of the day/ Im wasting away\"), Daze expresses these emotions with more depth. Tears fall \"from desert eyes,\" home is \"a sweet prison,\" and both Satan and Icarus make cameo appearances. The lush, cavernous sonics produced by loyal Dum Dum Girls collaborators Richard Gottehrer and Sune Rose Wagner echo this step forward, too. Sonically and lyrically, Daze does Dreams one better by blowing personal sorrow up to a mythic scale.\nFrom \"Mine Tonight\" to the wonderfully brooding cover of Scottish new wave duos Strawberry Switchblades \"Trees and Flowers\" (\"I hate the trees and I hate the flowers, and I hate the buildings, the way they tower over me\"), theres not a weak song in the bunch. But the last two in particular are perhaps the best Dee Dees ever written. Dripping with conviction, longing and remorse (and set off by an instantly transfixing opening line: \"I want to live a pure life\"), \"Lord Knows\" has a melody so perfectly gratifying that youd swear youve heard it before. And in some ways, you have; it quotes the chord progression of \"Crimson and Clover\", right down to the chiming riff that punctuates the end of each line in the verse. But \"Lord Knows\" inhabits its influences so fully and with such conviction that this familiarity only makes it that much more magnetic. It taps into the strange sorcery of the greatest rocknroll songs, possessed with the power to set the world in slow motion for four commanding minutes.\n\"Season in Hell\", on the other hand, kicks earth back into its orbit. A distorted riff quivers, and then Sandys echoey, galloping beat drives the song forward. It is a song about the moment when your grief becomes portable, the necessity of continuing to mourn but also carrying on. Its a simple, emotionally sophisticated line from a band not generally lauded for their lyrics, but, coming at the end of a smartly sequenced narrative about darkness and redemption, its conclusion is that much more affecting: \"Doesnt dawn look divine?\"\nGarage rock is also a genre of quick burnouts, its best compilations scattered with one- or no-hit wonders whose most explosive fireworks burned bright for three minutes before vanishing altogether. So perhaps the most profound way that the Dum Dum Girls have transcended their influences is the simple fact that theyve stuck around, pushed past their limits, and gotten that much better. End of Daze is their best release. Much more than a stop-gap between LPs, its succinct but irrefutable proof that this bands dynamite has a long fuse.",

        "article_text": "Stefan Kozella is a whimsical guy. His music, from his early hip-hop moment through to his minimal techno heyday, has always been suffused with warm psychedelic colour. He brings that touch to his renowned remixes, where he reshapes the tracks of others in ways that would seem totally foreign to most. His first solo album in nine years, Amygdala appears after a quiet period that produced only 2009’s remix retrospective Reincarnations, and the founding of his own Pampa imprint. The German producer’s newest original work retains the quirky spirit of Reincarnations but settles into a kaleidoscopic landscape.\nIn a quote that’s been haunting Amygdala, Koze has apparently claimed the LP as his Sgt. Pepper’s. Hubris aside, that’s not such an unfair comparison. Both records rethink their respective genres from the ground-up, using elements and instruments that seem unusual on first glance but quietly lay the foundation for subtle reinvention. While it’s not likely to set the world on fire, dig beneath the pastel sheen and Amygdala is uncommonly engrossing for a techno album. Its visionary ambition recalls the fertile sprawl of Villalobos’ 2003 debut Alcachofa; baroque techno blessed with the carefree spirit of lounge music and Quiet Storm, dressed up in tie-dye, the music on Amygdala glows with an easy confidence.\nAmygdala feels like a painting made up of delicate brushstrokes compared to techno’s laser-cut precision. Kozalla often chooses softly expressive horns or lolling organ over electronics, as on the plush spring overture of “Royal Asscher Cut”, and numerous vocal features only add to the effect. For an artist who has spoken on record how he hates collaborating, over half of Amygdala’s tracks have a “feature” credit as he brings out a cast of charismatic vocalists from Caribous Dan Snaith to Matthew Dear. The dips into German balladry via his retouch of the classic Hildegard Knef lament “Ich Schreib’ Dir Ein Buch”, or his own heartworn slow-jam “Das Wort”, contribute to the the hallucinatory haze of styles and voices, like scrambling through a radio dial on mushrooms.\nKoze has always had a predilection for looping microscopic vocal fragments as the chief anchor for his songs. But now these ghostly voices coexist with the fleshed-out songwriting; on “Das Wort” they provide a sugary counterpoint to Dirk Von Lowtzow’s gruff German consonants, and on “Ich Schreib’ Dir ein Buch 2013”, a Motown choir’s rendition of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” is twisted into a sickly tapestry of moans and screeches. Overstuffed and overfed, each track is an embarrassment of riches with a hook or melodic morsel everywhere you look, but Kozalla never loses the plot in the overflow of ideas.\nThat’s probably why Amygdala feels so accomplished: songwriting. It’s not something we often think too hard about in dance music. But Koze considers every aspect, from hummable melodies to pristine soundscapes to lyrics. Wisely leaning away from dance music cliches of love and desire, Amygdala’s subjects veer from everyday life to grappling with nostalgia and self-identity. Its most charming moment comes with Matthew Dear’s quirky vocal spot on “My Plans”. In a typically alien cadence, Dear addresses the anxiety of a world where everything seems to be going wrong with the cheeky line: “When I notice the world is falling apart/ I will run a bath/ And why does this make me laugh?” It’s a fine motto for Koze himself, never losing sight of his infectious sense of humour or complete resistance to trends. With Amygdala, hes created an album that invites obsession. ",

        "article_text": "Lunice and Hudson Mowhawke of TNGHT emerged this year with a glass-shattering SXSW set and a few brash, colorful bangers on Rusties scene-defining BBC Essential Mix. While their contemporaries experiment with footwork loops, yacht rock, and 1970s prog, TNGHT zero in on raps fixation on the loud and chaotic. Hip-hop production has always had time for bass and bombast but a growing number of producers-- notably Lex Luger, the often copied but rarely equalled soundbomber behind Wakas influential Flockaveli-- have an almost nihilistic embrace of sonic overkill. \nTNGHT may not come from the American rap scene (Lunice is in Montreal, while HudMos Ross Birchard is based in Glasgow), but their connection to it is clear. Lunice and Birchard have great ears for whats what and whos making it: their engaging and well-curated hour-long mix for Diplos BBC show ranged from the mush-mouthed grit of Floridas Spaceghostpurrp to Chicagos recent wave of teenage antagonism (Chief Keef, Sasha Go Hard) without showing any signs of dilettantism.\nTheir self-titled debut EP for Warp and LuckyMe spans 16 minutes of some of the years most brazen, positively huge hip-hop sounds. Birchard recently copped to Pitchfork that inspiration usually hits him when hes on the couch, but this is no DIY laptop affair: HudMo and Lunice took to a high-end London studio to bang out these five cuts, and the results sound properly expensive. \nIronically, they arrived at this point by process of subtraction. Where something like Gunplays \"Jump Out\" crams well over a hundred SFX triggers into its short runtime, creating the kind of sonic swarm that threatens to swallow itself, TNGHTs take on post-Luger smash-and-bash drama is clean and precise. The simplicity is deceptive next to the records volume, and its minimalist approach, rounding off every seismic charge with a futuristic crispness that recalls Timbalands game-changing creative peak.\nAnother revelation dropped in that TNGHT interview is that there are yet-to-be-named MCs locked to spit over every single track on this EP some time in the future. Its a promising development, considering that their remix of Wakas recent single \"Rooster in My Rari\", which pulls off the four-leaf-clover achievement of actually making a Flocka single louder-- proves that Lunice and HudMos wordless bombs retain their effectiveness with rappers on them.\nOn their own, though, a keen sense of structure lifts TNGHTs productions above purely functional beat-tape grooves. The breadth of carnage on the EPs centerpiece, \"Higher Ground\", starts with looped handclaps and vocal samples and quickly ascends to martial-law status as a synthesized tuba pops in and out to steamroll buildings just for laughs. And \"Goooo\"s tight tonal coils sound like hot knives slashing through metal by its high-anxiety conclusion. \n\"[They] rarely work out,\" Birchard told us last month, regarding teaming up with others in the production world. \"Ive done loads of collaborations and Im never totally happy with the outcome because it feels like youre compromising something of yourself in it.\" Whats most impressive about TNGHTs sound, then, is how effortlessly cohesive and them it sounds. Those whose ears have been close to the ground over the past three years know that both HudMo and Lunices solo work shares more than a LuckyMe affiliation-- specifically, heavy-thudded bass rhythms, splashes of synth color, and a fun-first approach to melodic phrasing indebted to dance and R\u0026B alike. Separately, they compliment each other, but together, they finish each others sentences with exclamation points in bold, underlined, 72-point type. Since the EPs completion, HudMo and Lunice have been at work on individual solo albums, but their partnership has already yielded results so impressive and of-the-moment that its likely we havent heard the last of it.",

        "article_text": "The world is ending, and Chris Clark is writing its soundtrack. In the 35-year-old electronic producer’s latest dystopian vision, the Earth’s layers peel back with painstaking certainty while everything else bursts and pops in unrest. Temperatures flash between frostbite and flame. There are moments of unsettling calm, only to be ruptured by bruised sky, acid rain, famine, disease. Unknown beings attack, armed with tones set to bewilder. Somewhere, the sound of a muffled Billie Holiday acetate being mauled by a pack of lions echoes through the murk. There is last-chance dancing—or are those people just running away?\nAs far as end-times scenarios go, the one Clark sets forth on his eponymous seventh album is vivid. And while there’s plenty of terror to be found here, Clark resonates because it pinpoints both the humanity and the nothingness that come along with complete dread; he knows that in order for annihilation to mean anything, you have to care about what’s being annihilated. Because for every laser-burned bass kick and alien-probe synth, forces of good cautiously look out from the rubble in the form of twinkling lullabies and melancholic piano loops. In cinematic sci-fi terms—and it’s hard not to think of this record as a kind of headphone IMAX experience—Clark is more akin to Alfonso Cuarón’s devastating infertility parable Children of Men than, say, Independence Day: ominous because its pulse feels all too real.\nAt this point, Clark has been translating his wracked emotions via machines—samplers, software, synths—for about half his life, and Clark has him merging techno, electro, noise, classical, ambient, and post-rock with the skill of a virtuoso. Growing up just outside of London, he indulged in nascent omnivorous Internet-era listening habits, giving time to indie rap, Pavement, and Squarepusher as a teen before Warp deemed him next-in-line to their mindful electronic throne at the start of this century. Though it was probably unfair to expect Clark to live up to the legacies of Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, it was also inevitable. But with his third album, 2006’s Body Riddle, he quietly did just that, turning in an opus that moved the sounds of Warp’s classic 1990s roster forward, mixing sensuousness and mechanics to create a 21st century cyborg touchstone.\nOwing to the mercurial nature of his tracks, which often morph unexpectedly many times across just a few minutes, follow-up Turning Dragon was nearly as excellent but utterly different, trading in spectral atmosphere and hip-hop rhythms for a more full-on techno thrust. And after five years of frustratingly diffuse material that had the producer grasping at new styles and textures with mixed success, Clark is a much-welcomed return that locates the midpoint between Body Riddle’s tangibility and Turning Dragon’s bulletproof sheen. The album adds a fresh layer of grandiosity that hints at festival-sized dance music or even Trent Reznor’s churning soundtrack work while never bowing down to any type of current trend. Clark is like Aphex’s comeback Syro in that it showcases a veteran artist living and breathing within a sonic space of his own creation—and the fact that no one would confuse the two records is a testament to Clark’s hard-won individuality.\nWhat’s always set Clark apart is his eclecticism, dynamism, and flair for the dramatic, all of which is on fine display here. His tracks don’t drop as much as they slip or swerve, forever off-balance. He’ll end a techno album with eight minutes of beatless, sky-cracking ecstasy you’d expect to find on a Sigur Rós LP, and it will make sense. He’s allergic to the idea of standard sounds and presets, which is partly why we’re still talking about him 13 years after his debut. And unlike many of his more insular peers, Clark can be open to sentimentality—not schmaltz as much as a belief in humanness and all its inexact wonder. In electronic music’s never-ending battle between man and machine, he’s seeking a third way. “Its just far too easy these days,” he said in an interview earlier this year, talking about the copy-and-paste replicability of so much modern composition. “Im often inspired by the path of most resistance. Looking for those tiny snippets of error—machines being pushed into areas of behavior that seem wrong and unusable. There is real fruit there.”\nRather than fighting the SoundCloud hivemind with real people playing real instruments, à la Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories, he composed Clark largely on a computer by himself in a barn in the middle of the English countryside, cracking codes and inflicting glitches. As computerized watches and glasses inch toward ubiquity, this idea of subverting machines to make them more human seems like a particularly worthy preservation strategy—and nobody does that quite like Clark. Yes, he makes music that sounds like the end of the world. But he also makes you want to live long enough to see what that will look like.",

        "article_text": "The best description of Gonjasufis voice may have come from Flying Lotus, who gave the new Warp artist a high-profile appearance on Los Angeles deep cut \"Testament\". FlyLo called it \"timeless, incredible filth,\" which reads more laudatory than descriptive, but theres something about that voice that escapes simple specifics. On \"Testament\", Gonajsufi lost himself in the tracks wispy, ghostlike soul, but on earlier self-pressed records like Dead Midget on Stilts (Crutches) and Flamingo Gimpp (released under the name Sumach), his voice had a gruff, restless quality. His singing can sound raw, maybe a bit off, but his ability to pull off a frail falsetto and ragged rasp in equal measures gives him a serious depth of range.\nIn pairing with L.A. producer Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi has found a powerful outlet for his otherworldly strain of singing. Together theyve created A Sufi and a Killer, one of the most fascinating slabs of hallucinogenic head-nod music to arise from Southern Californias post-hip-hop vanguard. Unlike the digital bleeps and squelches of SoCal contemporaries FlyLo and Nosaj Thing, however, Gaslamp Killer and Gonjasufi draw from their hip-hop background to create an LP that could as easily fit on the Stones Throw roster as well as it does IDM-centric Warp. The beats knock, but for every moment of b-boy-friendly atmosphere, theres another moment-- or a simultaneous one-- that makes like 21st century acid rock.\nGonjasufis vocals are both haunting and haunted, coolly assertive yet frequently fixated on mortal matters, and they bleed vividly through Gaslamps corroded analog wall of zero-fi psychedelic noise. The results are stark: Brooding, bad-trip laments (\"Kobwebz\"), a doo-wop number punctuated by spacey twang (\"Duet\"), a warping of the blues (\"Ageing\"). Even the more straightforward stuff has a grimy quality to it, particularly the heavy soul of \"Change\", the bar-jazz tension of \"Advice\", and the woozy \"Kowboys \u0026 Indians\" with its Eastern vocals looped against a rust-covered revision of club rap beats circa 2003. A couple of previously issued tracks helmed by other L.A. producers sneak into Gaslamp Killers showcase as well: Warp 2010 comp selection \"Ancestors\" maintains the psychedelic mood with a sitar-driven Flying Lotus boom-clap, while both sides of last years Mainframe-produced \"Holidays\"/\"Candylane\" single contribute mini-Casio chirpiness and roller-rink funk. Even with the additional producers and the stylistic elasticity, it all coheres nicely.\nAnd if the production on A Sufi and a Killer proves anything, its that Gonjasufi can stitch himself into the beat whether its a heavy banger or a quiet ballad. \"Sheep\" is the most notable example of the latter, as well as a testament to both the singer and the producers ability to salvage a potentially corny concept: The lyrics are a vague and contradictory metaphor about wanting to be a sheep instead of a lion, but Gonjasufi sells it expertly with a fragile, subtly harmonic multi-tracked voice. And in the more impassioned moments-- \"She Gone\", \"DedNd\", \"Stardustin\"-- his off-kilter wail pushes an already surreal junkshop-rock aesthetic into a kinship with Safe as Milk-era Captain Beefheart. There are plenty of times where the mix renders the exact words elusive and indistinct, and a track or two where you might wish theyd stay that way, but the meaning comes clear enough. And what the words dont hold, that incredible, filthy timbre does.",

        "article_text": "Veckatimest aint perfect; lord knows it tries. More than most any album in recent memory not named Chinese Democracy (please keep reading), it is compositionally and sonically airtight, every moment sounding tweaked, labored over. Perfection-- and the pursuit thereof-- has its price, and in less able hands (with all love to Axl), this obsessive attention to craft and execution could lead to something dull. Whats perhaps the most remarkable thing about the truly remarkable Veckatimest, however, is how very exciting much of it is; no small feat for a painstaking chamber-pop record that never once veers above the middle tempo.\n2007s Friend EP had me worried that Grizzly Bears insistence on having everything in its right place had forced formula onto what had seemed to that point freewheeling and free-associative. For every inspired moment on Friend, there was another that fell back on the tried-but-true: a quiet intro bleeding into a big, harmonic midsection followed by an eventual denouement. That sound characterized a few of the better tunes on 2006s Yellow House-- and a fair bit of what little Grizzly Bear has released since. That said, weve had no shortage of Grizzly Bear-related music: Dan Rossens recently resuscitated Department of Eagles made a pretty great record last year, Chris Taylors done some stellar production work with Dirty Projectors and Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson, and the band proper have lined up onstage collaborations with high-minded sorts like Nico Muhly and the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In Veckatimest, one sees the fruit of that variegated labor as well; between records, these dudes have been busy getting better at all the things they do, and as it turns out, Veckatimest manages to do Yellow House at least a few better on nearly every metric.\nFirst, the songs. By now, many of you should be familiar with the stunning bounce of \"Two Weeks\", the skyward swoon of teen creeper \"Cheerleader\", and the surefooted shuffle of \"While You Wait for the Others\". (In fact, Im painfully aware you may just be intimately familiar with the whole damn thing. If thats you, listen good: that windtunnel 128k leak you nabbed that fateful night back in March? That is not Veckatimest. Get thee to a buying place.) Highlights, all, but theres more where that came from. The fluttering opener \"Southern Point\" takes off and circles back like a flock of birds, as inviting as Yellow Houses \"Easier\" and a whole lot more to the point. The Rossen-sung \"All We Ask\" does the Rossen thing, starting soft and slow before exploding around the halfway mark, but it does it as well as or better than anything weve heard from him before. The records final stretch, from \"While You Wait\" through the head-swimmer \"I Live With You\" to the masterful, muted \"Foreground\" closes Veckatimest on three very strong notes.\nBut this is Grizzly Bear, and despite an increased confidence in their pop sensibilities and an overall strengthening of melodies, theyre still meanderers at heart. Highlights abound, but Veckatimest does sound as though it was conceived as a whole piece, and one must consider both the overall structure and the connective tissue between the abundant highlights to judge it a success. Save \"Cheerleader\" and the lilting \"Ready, Able\", the stretch between \"Fine for Now\" and \"While You Wait\" wanders a bit; certain moments, like Rossens \"swim around like two dories\" line and the wispy, wheezing \"About Face\", hit harder than others. But youll be looking for a while to find anybody who thinks the center of Veckatimest is as strong as the stuff surrounding it.\nBeyond irking folks predisposed to slagging off intricate and, yeah, \"sophisticated\" music like this-- you stay punk, Imma stay fascinated-- this trip down yonder to the minor key will doubtless be the big complaint about Veckatimest. But really, couldnt we say the same about Yellow House? I mean, theres some jam in between \"Knife\" and \"On a Neck, On a Spit\", but theres an awful lot of wide-open spaces and deliberate left turns in there, too. Yellow House was not a record defined so much by its two or three big numbers as it was by the slightly haunting impression it left when you played it front to back; it sounded deconstructed, whereas Veckatimest feels built brick-by-brick. As I mentioned, Veckatimest handily beats Yellow House in the bangers department, and while youre not gonna hear \"Two Weeks\" on any radio station that isnt already playing Ted Leo, there is something prim and proper about the record. Yet the pop moments on Veckatimest feel even bigger after the slight deviation at its core; surrounded by a few sour notes and sidesteps, \"Cheerleader\" and \"Ready, Able\" becomes that much stronger, and even the less effective numbers (\"Hold Still\", \"Fine for Now\") seem only to cower a smidge as a result of the staggering heights theyre placed next to. Out of context, theyre every bit as good as the more sinewy stuff that wove Yellow House together.\nI walked into Grizzly Bears much-lauded set at the church down at SXSW this year a skeptic and came out a convert; I knew what a powerful live band they could be, having seen em twice before, but my fear about flatlining and my initial (and incorrect) impressions based on the Veckatimest leak had me convinced Id get my \"Knife\" and my \"Two Weeks\" and then perhaps a very welcome nap. What I got instead was as great a testament to band democracy as Ive seen onstage; these new tunes require a terrific amount of concentration and skill to pull off in that setting, and any band whose sprightliest number (\"On a Neck\", still) sounds like half a ragtime had to work awfully hard to win me over after Id spent the prior eight hours replacing beer-sweat with more beer. Yeah, Veckatimest sounds worked-over, but in the best of ways; carefully embellished, stripped bare when applicable, full of the joy of sounds colliding with other sounds. Grizzly Bear was once Ed Drostes band, but no longer; its a family affair, and only four guys so completely serious about music-making could come together to make an album this labor-intensive sound so airy, so natural.\nI get it; Grizzly Bear can come across to some as boring. Lord knows I could go my whole life never reading another Ed Droste Tweet about pho or seeing Chris Taylor use a neti pot. But this little microcosm of imperfection indie rocks been working through lately could use a foil like Veckatimest, a record that, in searching for perfection through meticulousness, feels beautifully flawed and gloriously off-kilter without either side serving as the entire narrative. Really, in a world far too concerned with backstories and far too lacking in good old dedication to craft, Grizzly Bears just about as boring as they come: four guys who very quietly set out to make a fantastic record. And so they did.",

        "article_text": "Since his debut in 2010 with the outstanding \"Sure Thing\", the young Los Angeles singer/songwriter Miguel has been something of a for-the-R\u0026B-heads-only sleeper star. He showed up armed with a guitar, an endearing croon that is both virtuosic and everyman, a coiffed haircut, and a slightly retro sensibility. His voice is an elastic thing thats rarely used to excessive effect; he avoids the histrionic R. Kelly worship of so many of his compatriots in favor of the school of smooth Sam Cooke ad-libs. And though his lyrics are full of silly puns and earnest platitudes, he takes sex very seriously: Hes a happily-married man in a genre full of lascivious bachelors, and his best music radiates maturity, self-assured and confident but rarely showy. But despite his obvious talent, he hasnt quite been able to break through to a wider audience.  \nMiguels 2010 debut album, All I Want Is You, was flanked with some stellar singles but weighed down by a lack of identity as he flitted from producer to producer. It sounded like he couldnt decide whether he wanted to be a Salaam Remi faux-nostalgia crooner or a smart hip-hop crossover star, and the indecision hung over the record like a cloud (it didnt perform well commercially either). He returned earlier this year with a free trio of EPs under the self-conscious title of Art Dealer Chic, showing a newfound entrepreneurial sensibility and a streak of independence. Those mostly self-produced songs at times sounded like rough sketches, but they made it up for it by sounding personal and liberated from the demands of the industry. Free and widely available, they earned him some well-deserved re-examination. They also contained his best songs to date. And now, with his second full-length, hes delivered on that early promise. \nKaleidoscope Dream starts off with \"Adorn\", also found on the first Art Dealer Chic EP. Its one of the giddiest love songs of the year, a track where ecstatic infatuation is hemmed in by Miguels understated vocal dexterity, and this album feels like its proper context. He rockets off into falsetto for irresistibly brief moments, and a new outro spirals elegant, trained vocal gymnastics around the songs chorus. \"Adorn\" also showcases Miguels secret weapon: modesty. Its definitively, deceptively simple, a nugget of concentrated sunshine, and not necessarily all that original. But Ill be damned if it doesnt pull you in and make you feel it. \nThat touch of modesty colors most of Kaleidoscope Dream. Theres the tender \"Use Me\" where he admits being nervous about having sex with the lights on. Even more affecting is the acoustic murmur \"Pussy Is Mine\", which deflates masculinized hip-hop tropes with insecurity, pleading, \"Tell me that the pussy is mine/ Cause I dont wanna believe that anyone is just like me.\" The sentiment turns sardonic on the Ryan Leslie-like jaunt of \"How Many Drinks?\", where gorgeous falsetto verses are offset by uncertain pleas of \"I dont wanna waste my time.\" \nThe plush, lightly psychedelic production buffers the records more barebones moments, and Miguels precocious vocals take flight on the bombast rather than drowning in it. Standout \"Do You...\" unfolds in an ethereal cloud of synth, voices streaming like angelic choirs before stumbling into a verse buoyed by its own euphoria. Not many singers could get away with lines like \"What about matinee movies/ Pointless secrets/ Midnight summer swim, private beaches/ Rock, paper, scissors/ Wait! best outta three!\" Its the stuff of unbearable rom-com montages, but Miguels playful delivery brings it over. Hes the rare vocalist who makes you feel what hes singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent. When he wants to sound deadly serious, hes on the verge of tears; when hes happy, hes practically laughing as he sings.\nKaleidoscope Dream has elements of the sort of tasteful R\u0026B record that the Grammys love, but much like Beyoncés 4, it cuts through its own statuesque stateliness with raw emotion reined in by an ever-present sense of professionalism. And it succeeds in part because it sounds like Miguels album and no one elses. There are no intrusive guest appearances, and the record sounds even less of its time than the first, reveling in its own contextual vacuum with abandon. Though there are some unexpected choices. Like \"Dont Look Back\", which is propped up by grand synth runs before melting into an interpolation of the Zombies \"Time of the Season\". That songs musky psychedelia is a good example of the records overarching theme, the highly sexualized seen through the lens of the eager and innocent. \nWhen Miguel isnt accompanied by glossy synths, the music is all about intimacy. Take \"Arch \u0026 Point\"-- with a simple rasp, strum, and metronome, it sounds like it was recorded in the very bedroom its ostensibly taking place in. \"When it feels this good then it just comes natural,\" he insists, and theres not a better ethos for where his career stands at this point. Emerging unscathed from middling mainstream performance, Kaleidoscope Dream sounds, at its utmost, natural and easy, an artist set free to do what he wants and proving himself every bit the unique voice his debut seemed to deny. Its respectful of tradition, quietly ambitious, and deeply personal, a wonderfully considered album from an artist who was starting to seem a lot like a forgotten gem in the wake of mishandled promotion.",

        "article_text": "If their debut was any indication, Tame Impalas second full-length, Lonerism, will once again be compared to albums from the late 1960s and early 70s. But if their intent was to make a record that sounds like it came from that era, theyve failed and ended up with something more fascinating. Sure, theres merit to the countless groups and scenes that seek out the right tube amps and compressors and microphones in order to create flawless period pieces. Theyre often called \"revivalists,\" even though the actual term is wasted on them. Are they really breathing new life into this form by keeping it cryogenically frozen in ideas nearly a half-century old? Tame Impala prove far more exciting because, by maximizing the use of the available technology, they tap into the progressive and experimental spirit of psychedelic rock, and not just the sound.\nTame Impala did something similar on 2010s Innerspeaker, and they might be open to \"Same Impala\"-type jokes if the expanse of psychedelic rock were something youd be expected to move on from after one record. Lonerism does make the kind of tune-ups that typically generate a lot of second LP plaudits: Its leaner, more propulsive, more confident, and less beholden to its influences. But Lonerisms genius manifests itself in Tame Impalas ability to figure out a way to integrate the concepts of electronic music-making without resorting to ripping off the breakbeat/Beatles template of \"Setting Sun\". \nLeader Kevin Parker doesnt sound like an electronic producer, he just thinks like one. He sees his songs as blank canvases rather than boxed-in verse/chorus structures while emphasizing fluidity, constant motion, and textural evolution. You could spend the entirety of opener \"Be Above It\" letting your ears luxuriate in the diversity of tactile sensations-- the subliminal whisper of the title becomes a rhythm track, a barreling drum break is severely tweaked to sound like an oncoming rush of bison, a flanged guitar wobbles like neon Jello, and Parkers laconic, slightly echoed vocals pulls the whole thing together. Lonerism could go anywhere from that point, which is confirmed by the majestic song that follows, \"Endors Toi\". Follow the regal path of the lead synth or tilt your ears towards the righteously loud drum rolls that sound like masterfully chopped Bonham/Moon samples. Im reminded of Radioheads stated goal on \"Airbag\", which was to recreate Endtroducing..... in real time, or what DJ Shadow himself has been trying to do ever since in terms of merging the rarest vinyl grooves with your stony older brothers record collection.\nThose are the first two songs on Lonerism, and its bold to lead off with seven minutes of mostly instrumentals. Yet for all of the sonic trickery, Tame Impala are anchored by the righteous aspects of classic rock. Theyre throwbacks in the sense that they operate from a pre-punk perspective where each musician has the chops and confidence to be capable of soloing, and the singer and the drummer were cranked loud as hell. Yes, Parker does sound like John Lennon. Many athletes pattern their golf swings after Tiger Woods, their batting stance on Barry Bonds, or stick out their tongue while taking a jump shot like Michael Jordan. It means little if you dont have the skills to connect and perform.\nMore important is how Parker writes melodies that are instantly memorable, that rise and fall with beautiful simplicity and give what are fairly basic and relatable sentiments heft. Lonerism lacks a chorus that instantly pops like \"Solitude Is Bliss\", which is an issue only if you think the best melodies necessarily need to appear in the middle of the song. Youd be hard-pressed to find hooks as catchy as the verses during the run that spans \"Music to Walk Home By\" through \"Elephant\", and while none initially stands out as the kind of hit that might push Tame Impala to bigger festival stages, the cumulative effect means Lonerism might.\nSo, the above is all well and good for the people who might use Lonerism to EQ their hi-fis. Does it make you feel anything? On Innerspeaker, Parker sang, \"You will never come close to how I feel,\" so whats the emotional component to Lonerism? Though Parkers lyrics are plainspoken and occasionally a little elusive, Tame Impalas two records are called Innerspeaker and Lonerism, some of their songs go by titles like \"Solitude Is Bliss\", \"Why Wont They Talk to Me?\", \"Island Walking\", and \"Mind Mischief\". You get the idea of where Parkers head is at, or more to the point, that Parkers head is where hes at.\nThats a fairly common concern in this realm. You think about most of the technophile, prog-rock opuses of recent decades and most sound like spiritual heirs of King Crimson, Pink Floyd, or Black Sabbath; records like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Kid A, and The Moon \u0026 Antarctica tell the listener that their state of being is forced upon them, by shadowy governments, by heartless technology, by an uncaring god. It justifies the headphones-bound quarantine. What distinguishes Tame Impala is how they are able to explore the emotional difference between being alone and being isolated. Jayson Greene described Parkers voice vividly as \"like someone trapped John Lennons vocal take from A Day in the Life in a jar and taught it to sing new songs.\" In terms of a mentality, to me its more along the lines of \"Im Only Sleeping\", embodying and advocating a wakeful and passive state of psychedelia. \nLonerism derives much of its philosophical and musical pleasure from this interaction of micro and macro. Tame Impala stack vocal and guitar harmonies on the loveably hungover \"Mind Mischief\", and then Parker and co-producer Dave Fridmann take control of the mixing consoles and shake the whole thing up like a snowglobe. A similarly fun trick happens on \"Apocalypse Dreams\", which builds the momentum of a bouncy Northern Soul groove up to a peak before the mix abruptly cuts off and spits them back into a panoramic, HD jam.\nAll these rich sounds serve as an alternate take on anticipating technological encroachment, that humanity and technology arent necessarily at war. You feel small while listening to Lonerism, but in a way that makes you appreciate how man, machine, and Mother Nature can harmonize. Lonerism is portable and joyous in an unforced way, a soundtrack for the times when youre walking downtown and look up at a collection of skyscrapers, or driving through a mountain pass on an interstate or even looking at a Ferris wheel next to an ocean thinking, \"Holy shit, how did this all get here?\" ",

        "article_text": "In fall 2009, a mysterious artist called How to Dress Well posted a free EP called The Eternal Love, and a half-dozen more EPs followed on the projects blog in the next six months. The music on these mp3 releases consisted of cheap-sounding home recordings that were murky and blown out, but the style drew on the ethereal end of contemporary R\u0026B, with layered vocals, falsetto, and tons of reverb. They turned out to be the work of Tom Krell, a philosophy student who splits time between Brooklyn and Cologne, Germany. The online buzz surrounding HTDW built steadily through 2010, and now we have Love Remains, a collection of songs taken from the EPs (some of which have been re-touched in the studio) plus a handful of new tracks.\nKrell has clear and specific ideas of what he wants to do with How to Dress Well, many of which use the process of memory as focal point. According to blog posts and interviews, Krell cares deeply about R\u0026B from the late 1980s and 90s, and hes creating a ghosted version of the music, suggesting how sounds wear down and fade over time. \"I Started Remembering in 1989\" was the title of a blog post from just before that first EP, and it accompanied an iconic photo of Bobby Brown; as Krell noted on his Twitter, it would be a good title for some future How to Dress Well retrospective.\nThe conceptual foundation is interesting, but Love Remains succeeds because you dont have to think about that stuff to absorb its peculiar magic. For one thing, it has an arresting surface-level prettiness that offers an easy way in. \"Ready for the World\", a sort of half-cover of \"Love You Down\", the silky 1986 slow jam by the Michigan group Ready for the World (it was also a minor hit in the 90s for singer INOJ), sums up the How to Dress Well aesthetic. The lyrics are indecipherable, suggesting that feeling where youre trying to sing an old song you love but cant remember the details, so you mumble along with the melody; the percussion is crude and indistinct, and somehow sounds halfway between a sample and a bad recording of hand  claps in a bedroom; a sampled voice from elsewhere repeats through the track, sounding both machine-like and human. Interesting questions come to mind-- Is this a cover, and do I need to know the original? Why is it so distorted?-- but its also easy to let \"Ready for the World\" wash over you, which turns out to be true of the album as a whole.\nThe basic template of \"Ready for the World\" is subtly modified from track to track, so while the album feels very much like a complete statement, individual songs also stand out. One major highlight is \"Decisions [ft. Yüksel Arslan]\", a lurching waltz with voices piled up into a mini choir that hits with an almost symphonic grandeur. The hugeness of its sound is something considering how modestly it was recorded, and \"Decisions\" manages to feel both tragic and uplifting at once. The opening \"You Hold the Water\" is HTDW at its ambient extreme. Beginning with a sample of dialog from Todd Haynes film Safe, it pulses along with darker, almost industrial samples bumping up against Krells voice, offering a mood that intentionally avoids coming together as a song. \"Endless Rain\" gets an unbelievable amount of mileage from a single loop of drum and piano: As the Soul II Soul-like rhythm bit repeats, Krell ad libs vocals that seem to bubble up from some kind of pre-verbal place. You can pick out \"you\" and \"say\" and not much else, but it doesnt matter; the track still manages to capture a feeling in its two and a half minutes.\nIf the contemporary R\u0026B slow jam thrives on the tension between earthy sexuality and the spiritual concerns of gospel, How to Dress Well mostly does away with the sex part. The thin recording and distant-sounding vocals cause the physicality of the music to dissipate into a spectral fog, leaving behind music that feels intimate and devotional and ultimately lonely-- theres a song called \"Cant See My Own Face\" and another called \"My Body\", and you get the feeling that the domain of the music probably stops there. This isnt a space for probing the specifics of relationships; its far too hermetic for that. Theres a lot of rain and a lot of death-- two tracks called \"Suicide Dream\", another called \"You Wont Need Me Where Im Goin\". An album I keep thinking of when listening to How to Dress Well is Panda Bears 2004 LP, Young Prayer. That was another homemade record haunted by mortality with blurred words that nonetheless managed to communicate a powerful and highly personal sense of spiritual yearning. There are also hints of Bon Iver in Krells falsetto and in the way he transforms the signifiers of R\u0026B into something homegrown and personal. You can sense a few different strands of music from the last few years coming together with the sounds of an earlier era to form something new.\nThe distortion is at places so harsh, its hard not to wonder why Krell doesnt do away with it. But with the sex and romantic yearning removed, the tension between the ethereal and prayerful mood comes from the quality of the recording, the way the music seems to be breaking apart as you are listening to it. How to Dress Well is to my mind the biggest breakthrough in home-recorded lo-fi in years. It feels brave, like its going places a lot of artists in this sphere are afraid to go. And since the emotions communicated are direct and palpable even if the specifics are elusive, it also has something for people who dont follow this world of music closely. I can promise you that as I type this right now, 15-year-old kids who have been freaking out over this album are in front of their computers, trying to make their own version of this music. Well see how that goes. But the impulse makes sense. Love Remains, because of its construction, feels like music that comes from inside, as if the act of listening completes it.",

        "article_text": "Most people who follow Ariel Pink were introduced to him by 2004s The Doldrums, the first non-Animal Collective release on that bands Paw Tracks label. From the beginning, Pink was presented as an outsider, a recluse who obsessively recorded at home and had compiled hundreds of unheard songs. The notion that he was a supremely strange person making music in his own world was fully supported by the string of albums, singles, and EPs that followed. First, there was the music itself, which saw Pink using an ultra lo-fo recording set-up to re-imagine cheesy AM radio jingles and lost new wave tracks as surreal, art-damaged pop. His music could be bizarre and disturbing, with warped voices and dark subject manner evoking loneliness, bad drugs, and alienation; it could also be sweet and even sincere, celebrating the pleasure of a well-rendered verse melody and a good chorus.\nThen there was the fact that the recordings themselves had apparently been excavated from a cache of material from another time: The vast majority of the music hes released since 2004 was written and recorded years earlier, mostly between 1998 and 2002. So a certain amount of mystery was part of the package, and the recordings werent giving anything away. His releases never struck me as possessing the level of genius his most ardent supporters hear in them, but that was OK, because he didnt seem like he was setting out to make masterpieces.\nSomething unusual has happened to Ariel Pink since he first started sharing those tapes with the wider world, though. Think of it like the cliché about The Velvet Underground \u0026 Nico, but on a smaller, more craft-y scale: His records didnt reach a lot of people, but many of those who heard them were inspired to start home recording projects of their own. So as different kinds of lo-fi music bubbled up from the indie underground in the last couple of years-- from more placid chillwave to roughed-up garage rock to abstract instrumental music-- and many of these bands were talking about his influence, all of a sudden Ariel Pink started looking way ahead of the game. And now, hes been given a chance to do something few artists working on his scale ever do: record an album more or less professionally for a large independent label and enjoy all the increased attention such a leap provides. He did not waste the opportunity.\nOddly, the difference in fidelity isnt what sets this record apart from earlier Ariel Pink releases. While much of the tape hiss that marked those records is gone, along with the degraded audio quality that came off those old, decaying cassettes, this is still a pretty modest-sounding LP, recorded simply and cleanly but not, from the sound of it, expensively. Haunted Graffiti, which began as an abstract concept, has also turned into a full band featuring experienced members whove spent years playing in established independent acts, and each took care to get their various parts right. The vocal harmonies overlap just so, the guitar fills are in the right places, the drumming is tight and precise, and bassist Tim Koh in particular colors the songs with striking rhythmic and countermelodic depth. It turns out that these details make a big difference, even while the album adheres to the hazy overriding aesthetic of Pinks earlier records. The fact that this is, in a sense, Ariel Pinks first group of songs created to be released together and presented as a whole-- as an album, rather than as a collection of songs recorded years ago-- sets the table for a new focus.\nWe know from interviews that Ariel Pink grew up absorbing throwaway pop from the 70s and 80s, finding a way to make it all fit into his cracked worldview. Something overlooked about those songs, though, is that the people writing them were pros who knew something about intros, codas, and middle-eights, how a certain kind of chord change can cause the turnaround to the chorus to hit a little harder. Ariel Pinks best songs are surprising, and theres a real sense of musical delight on Before Today; the sections sound logical but never predictable, and there are wild bridges and short bits that emerge seemingly randomly but wind up taking the song somewhere unexpected. So \"Lestat (Acc. to the Widows Maid)\" goes from a rollicking organ-led opening section to a catchy call-and-response chorus hook the Monkees might have liked to a short double-time instrumental section to a jubilant coda, and all the while the stitches never show. Songs like \"Little Wig\" have so many interesting interlocking parts that they can almost feel proggy, despite their relative brevity and tight pop structures.\nSince a number of these songs exist in earlier versions on other records, its easy to hear how they benefit from Before Todays more worked-over approach. \"Beverly Kills\" was a fine song in its original incarnation on the 2002 edition of Scared Famous (it also appeared on last years Grandes Exitos comp), but it has so much more power here. Opening with roller-rink keyboards, a popping bass, and car chase sound effects, it feels loose and casual until the falsetto vocals snap into place, sounding suddenly like Philip Bailey on a lost Earth, Wind \u0026 Fire jam. The delicate soft rock of \"Cant Hear My Eyes\", also heard twice before in slightly cruder forms, benefits greatly from just a few more dabs of production mousse. Its a song that wants to be slick, bringing to mind carefully layered singles by Alan Parsons Project, complete with swells of synthetic strings and a smooth sax interlude.\nAnd then theres \"Round and Round\", one of indiedoms most unifying and memorable songs in 2010, which is barely recognizable from its early four-track incarnation as \"Frontman/Hold On (Im Calling)\". Its another song of smartly integrated units of melody, any one of which might be built out into a great song of its own, but which together become something astonishing. Its circular bassline doubles with low-chanted voices that build up tension and mystery, a connecting section that opens the song up with a high-pitched plea, and an interlude section with a ringing phone and some jazzy keyboards, all of which build to the massive sing-along chorus. \"Round and Round\" was mastered at Abbey Road, and not a cent of that cost was wasted. It is endlessly replayable.\nAlongside these grabbier tunes are tracks that retain the uncanny, otherworldly sense that has been a constant thread through Ariel Pinks music. Best among these is \"Menopause Man,\" which goes from grim deadpan verses to a fascinatingly beautiful chorus that sounds beamed in from another era, yet remains elusive and difficult to place. But even given the varied style and tone on Before Today-- theres a queasy instrumental and a faithful cover of the 60s garage rock song \"Bright Lit Blue Skies\"-- it feels of a piece and uniformly strong, and theres so much going on that it only seems to improve the more you listen to it.\nIts a rare feat for artists to maintain a truly unique sound while taking their music in a direction that appeals to a wider audience. For those whove been following along for a few years, this is a groundbreaking record that condenses and amplifies Ariel Pinks most accessible tendencies. But the brilliant thing about Before Today is that no prior knowledge of his catalog is required. Newcomers can dig into this record and absorb all of these weird and wonderful songs now, and save the backstory for another day.",

        "article_text": "Nicolas Jaar would likely take offense with the same old dutiful recitation of his credentials— you know, the Chilean-born, Brown-educated electronic wunderkind, Clown \u0026 Sunset label head, serious artiste behind BBC’s Essential Mix of 2012, musical cubes, and a 5-hour MoMA performance in a geodesic dome. In our interview from earlier this year, Jaar wanted to shed his past reputation, and that’s fair enough. Who doesn’t hope to be seen as a different person at 23 than they were at 21? But thats the kind of C.V. you only play down if youre worried about being called an elitist or running for public office. That might not be so far off the mark in regards to Darkside, Jaar’s partnership with guitarist Dave Harrington. The name alone triggers an automatic word association with an album owned by over 50 million people and recognized by nearly everyone who’s made it to 10th grade. The prismatic, black-lit aura of their fascinating, endlessly explorable debut Psychic doesn’t try to stop anyone from making that connection and if you spot Jaar’s stated influences of Can and Richie Hawtin, that’s fine too: rarely has a record held such appeal for the high-minded while welcoming the simply high-minded.\nThough a logical extension of the prog-dance fusion explored on Darkside’s self-titled EP from 2011, it makes their curious reimagination of Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories from a few months back feel like their true debut. Upon initially hearing it, one could easily think of Daftside as an academic work rather than something meant for listening pleasure—a foment of the bubbling resentment towards the original’s Gatsby-esque confluence of ostentatious extravagance and genuine, if self-serving, benevolence; it was a hell of a party that left a lot of up-and-coming producers feeling like they were locked out of East Egg. However, Psychic and Daftside have the same essential goal, guided equally by artistic reverence and crackpot scheming. And that aim is to emulsify the disparate record industry obsessions that dominated right before the advent of the compact disc: opulent disco and ornate prog-rock, yacht-pop and astral funk, the former of each almost exclusively singles mediums, the latter beholden to the LP and all sounding like the sole province of bearded, flamboyantly lapelled millionaires.\nOn the gargantuan opening gambit of “Golden Arrow”, Darkside spend 11 minutes misremembering the ground rules for music neither of them were alive to hear the first time around. The heartbeat pulse serving a baseline for those distant, whirring synthesizers and hollowed-out drones is pure space-rock, but the gorgeous overlay of sighing cello and digital disintegration is not. When the beat finally drops after about four minutes, it’s a slack and stumbling disco interloper—high on pot, not blow. Those palm-muted funk guitars have After Dark bloodshot tincture, but that label would never allow this much modernist, bit-crushing babble in their proudly purist Italo, let alone that undulating synth bass. And then, Harrington’s falsetto takes off like an apparitional Gibb brother and...are we sure this isn’t disco? Do these guys have any clue what they’re doing?\nThankfully, the answer is “hell no”—they have a plan, but no ground rules or precedents; Darkside aren’t recreating anything. The subliminal bass shadowing Jaar’s vocals on the confounding, starched-shirt blues of “Paper Trails” has its own gravitational pull, it only exists in music made by Nico Jaar. Nor is there a session player capable of conjuring the panglobal percussion that morphs throughout “The Only Shrine I’ve Seen”, the impossibly lush layering of cymbals, snares, bells, and claps joining the hands of church choirs, marching bands, and Buddhist monks. Even Harrington’s rudimentary, blues box guitar soloing gives Psychic crucial, humanist grounding—those slowhand Dire Straits leads are the last thing you’d expect a forward-thinking electronic musician to incorporate into their mission statement, but amongst all the retro-futurist discovery, it’s the sound of rediscovery, similar to the reclamation of saxophones on Destroyers Kaputt  or Bon Ivers electric-piano vindication of \"Beth/Rest.\"\nPsychic is rife with extraterrestrial atmosphere and alien texture, but it never strays into pure ambience. Bust out the beanbag chair if you want, but in a record that fits an incredible amount of music into a compact 45 minutes, the silences are moments of active listening, too. “Sitra” initially registers as a necessary comedown from the stern demands of “Golden Arrow” until it pans completely in the left stereo channel. Darkside anticipate the very moment right before the disorientation of the unbalanced mix would be unnecessarily confrontational and drop you right into “Heart”, a traipse down the yellow brick road set to unsettling tribal drums. And just when you think its getting kind personal on its one narrative (“Paper Trails”), the album drifts off into staticky calm.\nThat tranquil moment gets blown open thirty seconds later by \"The Only Shrine Ive Seen\" and that’s just the first half of Psychic coming to a close. Side B only gets weirder as it hews more closely to Jaar’s associations with proper dance music. Up to this point, “space disco” typically meant one thing—airy, pretty, generally envisioning a brighter, cleaner future. “The Only Shrine I’ve Seen” and “Freak, Go Home” imagine what dance music could spring up from our future lunar cities if they’re every bit the dense, intimidating, metal monstrosities they are here on earth, teeming with both life and decay, flesh and rust. The most innovative and intriguing sounds on Psychic are almost entirely dedicated to its rhythm section—panned tambourines whizzing through “Paper Trails”, gooey snares on the hot-buttered closer “Metatron”, “Freak, Go Home”’s constant fluidity between acoustic and digital percussion. Though Psychic is the kind of immense and immersive experience typically described as “monolithic”, Jaar and Harrington ensure it’s more like the bubble gracing its cover—translucent and dense, electrified and organic, holding a form while constantly being prodded into new shapes.\nWhen a record spends this much time reveling in pure sound, it’s understandable to ask, “Where’s the humanity?” The most instantly memorable lyric comes on “Paper Trails”, when Jaar intones “I want a house to live in/ Baby to take care of,” though in that voice of his, you never expect him to mean exactly what he says. Psychic doesn’t talk a whole lot about its feelings; true to its title, it’s not looking for a heart-to-heart so much as a telepathic exchange. And in trying to read Jaar and Harrington’s minds, you might think a little differently about things you already know, which can be just as important as being moved. Though the psychedelic density and classic rock touchstones of Psychic are ostensibly a negation of Jaar’s breakthrough, the quizzical, minimalist Space Is Only Noise, reconsider his intimidating biography and all of a sudden, Darkside makes a ton of sense, establishing connections between listeners and genres rather than pronouncing differences—people dance to Ricardo Villalobos, start record labels because they want to make music with their friends and, yes, Ivy League kids like to get stoned and listen to Pink Floyd. At least for the duration of Psychic, everything under the sun is in tune.",

        "article_text": "Around this time last year, Margaret Chardiet almost died. Days before the noise artist was supposed to go on her first European tour, doctors discovered a cyst so large it almost brought on organ failure. The subsequent surgery and healing process was long and intense. During the weeks of bed rest, a dying man lay next to her in the hospital, crying out for his daughter to join his side. For whatever reason, she never showed up.\nIn the rearview, Chardiet’s situation sounds like hell, and so does her latest album as Pharmakon, Bestial Burden. In a recent interview with Pitchfork, she described the theme of her second LP for Brooklyn-based label Sacred Bones as “[a] desire to show the body as a lump of flesh and cells that mutate and fail you and betray you—this very banal, unimportant, grotesque aspect of ourselves.” It’s a grim focus on the corporeal, a lens that Chardiet has projected her nightmarish music through before; on last year’s Abandon, the roaring final track was gruesomely titled “Crawling on Bruised Knees”, the cover art a shot of Chardiet’s lower torso covered in maggots. On the cover of Bestial Burden, she literally turns the inside outwards, with grisly-looking butcher’s-shop organs placed accordingly on her upper torso and chicken talons glued to her fingers.\nMusically, Bestial Burden is a considerable step forwards for Chardiet, a feat that’s more impressive when considering that the genre she works in doesn’t necessarily call for artistic growth. Before releasing Abandon, Chardiet established her presence with a run of small-press releases similar to many noise musicians past and present, so that record wasn’t so much her debut as it was an introduction to a somewhat wider audience. If the depth-charge blasts of Abandon showcased an exciting emerging voice in experimental music, Bestial Burden elevates Chardiet to an even more accomplished plane. The sense of control that she wields over this nasty, fire-breathing music—a push-and-push-harder tension between pummeling rhythms, swaths of power-electronics static, and her impressive, chilling howl—provides a sense of structure that makes this very out-there music easy to grasp for those outside of noise music circles. \nStill, chaos reigns on Bestial Burden, an album that sounds like anything but a safe space to inhabit. Chardiet’s steadier focus on rhythm provides a sound structure nonetheless annihilated by jet-engine roars, bursts of mechanical heat, and ear-bleeding screeches. Paradoxically, the harshest and most alienating moments on Bestial Burden arrive when the record is at its quietest: album opener “Vacuum” practically serves as a portal into the record’s landscape, as Chardiet’s vocal hyperventilation is backed by a undulating fuzzy drone that rubs against the ears like a drill to the teeth. “Primitive Struggle” lays wet, heaving coughs over a heartbeat-like rhythm that eventually grows to an insistent thud, bleeding beautifully into the death-march stomp of “Autoimmune”. By turning the human body’s failures into rhythmic tools at her disposal, Chardiet has created the truest form of body horror.\nFittingly, her voice is the albums most expressive instrument, at times recalling black metal’s pitchless burn. While her vocal approach on Abandon came across as sprawling and freeform in its presentation, Chardiet takes the shape of a menacing furnace on Bestial Burden, giving off blasts of heat and steam that are deeply felt even as they recede into the darkness. In the aforementioned interview, Chardiet groused about the reception her difficult music receives: “When I put that out to someone and the only thing they can say is, ‘Oh look, it’s a girl screaming,’ I want to fucking kill them because I’m literally pouring my heart and soul out, being so vulnerable.” On Bestial Burden, her voice casts jagged, threatening shadows, but on a record that concerns itself with bodily disintegration, Chardiet’s forcefulness is a necessary human constant.\nHer most surprising performance arrives on the album’s closing title track, seven minutes of pulsing tones that culminates in tangled noise and mutated vocal strangulation. Before “Bestial Burden”’s satisfyingly destructive conclusion, though, Chardiet expresses herself in a way that stands apart from the rest of the six-track record; her voice sways and swerves with disorienting clarity, sounding almost psychedelic with every half-spoken dispatch. Chardiet has played it straight previously when it comes to her vocals—her cover of “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)”, featured on Sacred Bones’ 2013 compilation Todo Muere Vol 4, was surprisingly faithful to the original—but the wavy, near-meditative form of “Bestial Burden” is, at least for those who just arrived to the Pharmakon party a year ago, unexplored territory. As a whole, Bestial Burden highlights Chardiet’s ability to re-draw the boundaries of her own artistic approach, ripping out its guts and creating something new out of the decaying remains.",

        "article_text": "Brooklyns Fang Island describe their aesthetic as \"everyone high-fiving everyone.\" So its appropriate that the bands website features a video of them jamming out with kindergartners and another with Andrew WK-- people so caught up in having a good time that you sometimes wonder if theyre bullshitting you. What helps Fang Island steamroll past cynicism is how \"fun\" isnt just an ornament for them, its embedded in the bands musical DNA.\nFang Islands self-titled second album is joyous despite its general lack of verses or choruses. Its fractured like any post-punk record while also speaking the language of classic rock, yet often feels like an intricate collage pieced together from elements that make songs memorable-- palm-muted power chords following wide-open intros, blistering solos, double-time outros. Pretty much all of that is crammed into the deleriously infectious \"Daisy\", an emphatic crossbreed of the Go! Team and the Promise Rings \"Is This Thing On?\" The dance routine in the songs video feels like the only natural reaction to hearing it.\nAs Fang Islands entry point, \"Daisy\" might come on a bit strong, but what precedes it sets the tone perfectly. The record opens with fireworks (literally), before an armada of severely EQd guitar harmonics swoop in like fighter jets. The band then bursts into a dense chorus of four-part harmonies, earnestly intoning the WK-ish positive mantra: \"They are all within my reach. They are free.\" Next comes \"Careful Crossers\", which has no words but would be shortchanged by being called an \"instrumental\" when such lyrical riffs pop up every eight bars.\nFang Island arent total deconstructionists-- the see-sawing rhythms and stutter-step cadence of songs like \"Life Coach\" and \"Treeton\" wouldnt be out of place on a Spoon or Modest Mouse album. But unlike other pop craftsmen, Fang Island rarely give you any indication of what direction they might take. \"Sideswiper\" appears to settle into a Ted Leo-ish 12/8 stomper after its darting intro, until a sudden acoustic guitar and high-wire leads hints that the whole thing might just be one big riff on \"Jack and Diane\".\nThe music coordinators at MTV recently tapped \"Daisy\" to soundtrack a series of commercials for the reality show The Buried Life. The premise of the show-- \"What do you want to do before you die?\"-- is pretty corny, but Fang Islands exuberance is perfect for chasing dreams. While their manic musicianship and group-hug vibe may inspire more than a few comparisons to the badly missed Mae Shi, they arent about proselytizing. This music is just honest and life-affirming and infectious, and its that rare concentration of directness and simplicity that makes Fang Island so uniquely and wonderfully inclusive.",

        "article_text": "Chromatics formed in the Pacific Northwest as a rickety no-wave band more than a decade ago, but re-emerged in the mid-2000s with a revamped lineup and a new sound that nicely coincided with a resurgence of interest in the slow, dreamy, not-always-Italian dance-pop subgenre known as Italo disco. As with other acts on New Jersey-based Italians Do It Better, a label co-founded by group mastermind Johnny Jewel, Chromatics didnt just incorporate the vocoders and vintage synth arpeggios of the turn-of-the-1980s originals, they added the brittle guitars, dubby reverb, and urban dread of post-punk. \nIn the years since, the labels emphasis on grainy synths, smokey ambience, and analog-fetishizing textures became the M.O. of an entire class of artists. And the bands 2007 Night Drive set the blueprint for last years Nicolas Winding Refn-directed thriller Drive; featuring two Jewel-assisted tracks, the films soundtrack exposed this music to a wider audience. Earlier this year, Jewel built on that momentum by releasing a two-hour epic created with fellow Chromatics member Nat Walker. Titled Symmetry, Themes for an Imaginary Film, the set culled material from a full score that the duo were said to have composed for Drive. \nKill for Love, Chromatics first album since Night Drive, finally gives this loosely associated, prematurely decayed musical aesthetic its magnum opus-- and brilliantly transcends it. The moonlit vibe of previous highlights like street-skulking stunner \"In the City\" or haunting Kate Bush cover \"Running Up That Hill\" recurs, and various tracks still crackle and pop with the all-too-mortal degradation of vinyl. And despite the unfinished-seeming recording quality of the music videos that preceded the albums release, the completed product also boasts some of the most engrossing synth-pop songs so far this year. \nThe 90-minute Kill for Love signals its tour-de-force ambitions from the opening track, a synth-draped cover of Neil Youngs \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\". As with their past brooding renditions of Bruce Springsteens \"Im on Fire\" or Dark Days \"Hands in the Dark\", its a thoroughly rewarding pop deconstruction, setting one of singer Ruth Radelets most affecting performances against an evocatively restrained backdrop. \"Theres more to the picture than meets the eye,\" Radelet coos, in what emerges here as a key lyric. Theres more to Kill for Love than the sum of its best songs.\nThat said, Kill for Loves clearest improvement over Night Drive comes in its impressive clutch of left-field synth-pop standouts. The pill-dropping insomniac rush of the title track is the most likely to propel Chromatics onto the kinds of late-night TV stages and festival billings lately seized by M83, but the existential ache of \"Back From the Grave\" is no less gorgeously catchy. The bleakly yearning \"Lady\" returns to the groups signature Italo glide but wisely ditches the robotic vocal effects of a previously released late-2005 recording. When Jewel suggested in a recent Pitchfork interview that he was more influenced by Madonna than by crate-digging Eurodisco rarities, it was logical to wonder if he was being falsely modest. That is, until hearing \"These Streets Will Never Look the Same\", which stretches \"Eye of the Tiger\"-like guitar tension into an eight-minute treatise on loneliness and includes the albums first male lead vocal, rendered cyborg-like by a vocal harmonizer. Or take the vampire-pallid lament \"Running From the Sun\", another male-led track, based on piano chords reminiscent of those found on Cyndi Laupers \"Time After Time\". Fans who discovered Chromatics through Drive will find plenty of easy entry points here.\nStill, just as the pop songs on Kill for Love are more direct than on Night Drive, the interstitial tracks are also more expansive and abstract. \"Time is stretching on/ And it keeps repeating/ As the beat goes on,\" Radelet sings, on the deceptively uptempo last-ditch plea \"At Your Door\", and those words could just as easily apply to the albums instrumentals (and near-instrumentals). Nevertheless, even the records most ephemeral moments are more deeply engaging than their equivalents on the last album, livened up by disembodied vocals and orchestral touches. Though there appear to be as many references to walking and riding trains as to driving, the album is at least as cinematic as Themes for an Imaginary Film. In fact, the languorous \"Theres a Light Out on the Horizon\" goes so far as to revive Night Drives phone-call conceit, though with results that are more beautifully agonizing.\nAfter a front-loaded opening and sprawling, bewitching midsection, Kill for Love resurfaces with two tracks that encapsulate what Chromatics do, in an uncompromising way thats sure to confound as many people as it awes. \"The River\" reprises the Symmetry albums nearly a cappella closing track as glacial synth-pop, with finger snaps and artificial strings lending emotional support to Radelets stiff-lipped vocal performance as a woman left behind. And then theres a sparsely forbidding 14-minute instrumental finale, available on the digital versions of the album, which is appropriate of Jewels recent tendency to talk up 20th-century classical composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage rather than film scorers like John Carpenter.\nIf Kill for Love had been a 10-track LP, with its most immediately striking songs each edited down to around 3 minutes, it wouldve still been impressive. In fact, as recently as an interview posted last month by Self-Titled, Jewel hadnt yet made up his mind about whether to put out one or two discs. Ultimately, he made the right choice. Closer \"No Escape\" may not be as immediate as the title track when heard in isolation, but luckily, we dont have to listen to it in isolation. Just as on albums by the War on Drugs, Deerhunter, and countless others, the experimental interludes here help create a context that makes the pop songs that much more effective; by including so many mood-oriented parts, Kill for Love paradoxically rises above hazy synth-pops occupational hazard of dissolving into a blur of mood and mood alone. Its not just a collection of hits; its an album, one that gives the projects familiar nocturnal foreboding a new sense of grandeur. ",

        "article_text": "Shabazz Palaces emerged two years ago with an air of carefully cultivated mystery: Two EPs appeared, identified only by the Arabic patches on their covers. The music was some of the most exploratory hip-hop of the year, an enticing batch of fragmented raps and woozy, disorienting beats. You could find precedents for this stuff-- the amorphous wanderings of cLOUDDEAD, the jazz rap of the early 1990s-- but these EPs were largely on some sui generis shit: Nothing else out there sounded quite like Shabazz Palaces.\nThe Shabazz Palaces and Of Light EPs featured an MC going by the name Palaceer Lazaro, and he introduced an alternately glittering and gritty urban noir taking place in the unlikely setting of Seattle. That the reedy yet resonant voice behind Palaceers raps was readily identifiable as Ishmael \"Butterfly\" Butler of downtempo rap collective Digable Planets (and, later, Cherrywine) did little to lift the shroud. Butler declined interviews and dodged photographers, and when he did speak, his answers were as evasive as his raps were richly, if obliquely, illustrative.\nHis reticence was an attempt to let the music speak for itself and avoid comparisons to his previous acts (adding some alluring intrigue didnt hurt). And some comparisons are inevitable: The EPs continued the darkening trend that occurred in between Digables unlikely breakthrough Reachin (A New Refutation of Time and Space) and thornier follow-up Blowout Comb, and which developed further with the sinister funk of Cherrywine. But if Shabazz Palaces first phase was about building a mystique, their Sub Pop debut is the product of opening up. Black Up lets some sunlight in, breathes fresh air, and finds Butler returning to an occasionally lighter flow, the most unburdened hes sounded since the world first heard him. Which is not to say that these are easy, uncomplicated songs. Butler continues to eschew traditional verse-chorus structures in favor of tracks that unpredictably diverge and then pool into lone, evocative words or concise chants. And if some of Butlers rhymes and sonics are breezier than before, his tracks still retain their moody, hard-thudding, and sometimes psychedelic atmospheres.\nMost of these tracks end somewhere very different from where they begin. \"Free Press and Curl\" opens the album with a down but defiant rap (\"Musically and bitch-wise, too/ I lost the best beat that I had\") delivered over stuttering crunching drums and bass vibrations. Three minutes in, the tempo slows into a kind of galley song, a murky drift over which Butler fires off a couple of final, biblically imperative (\"thou shalt...\") verses. \"An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum\" (the albums track titles throughout are fascinating) begins as a playground chant stretched and smeared into a queasy loop over muffled kick and grainy snare. But then after a minute, everything drops out for a spooky mbira solo from Shabazz sideman and percussionist Tendai Maraire. \"Youlogy\" starts as a busy, druggy swirl-- a heaving bass, a synth wobbling in one ear, voices cut and pasted, echoing asymmetrically, everything dropping out on the word \"high\" in \"to get you HIGH\"-- and then breaks for some jazz trumpet and snippets of stylized dialogue, before proceeding as an altogether different, relatively cleared-out, bass-and-drum track.\nThat Shabazz Palaces songs follow such inscrutable routes makes it all the more striking when they coalesce around a repeated word or phrase. \"Free Press\" builds up to the rousing chant, \"You know Im free!\" over a ghosted gospel chorus. On \"Are You... Can You... Were You? (Felt)\", Butler exclaims, over ringing piano notes, wafting strings, and one great tinfoil handclap that swings in just half a beat later than expected, \"Its a feeling!\" \"Recollections of the Wraith\" glides in on two of the albums most effortless choruses, Butler first proclaiming/promising, \"Tonight!\" over a swooning, oohing female vocal, and then requesting, \"Clear some space out/ So we can space out.\" That last one is about as involved as any chorus here gets-- these are hooks boiled down to their most essential.\nEven forays into traditional structure end up typically idiosyncratic. The albums lone loverman song comes out a treatise-- well, actually, \"A treatease dedicated to The Avian Airess from North East Nubis (1000 questions, 1 answer)\". Its birds and bees rendered as bop poetry, working up to an insistently smooth come-on line that turns from astral to anatomical with the addition of one little two-letter word: \"I want to be there/ Let me be in there.\" The records dis track, \"yeah you\", snarls and bites but it also laments and ends as a breathless, headlong exorcism. All this is both in keeping with Butlers track record and indicative of his status as a hip-hop elder, an MC with some well-earned gray in his goatee. And its deeply refreshing to hear an artist who exudes such depth and consideration.\nStill, Butler is hardly yelling the kids off his lawn-- in fact, two of Black Ups best moments come from young guest stars THEESatisfaction, a similarly \"afro-eccentric\" female duo with whom Shabazz Palaces have been collaborating for much of the past year. Cat Satisfaction lends her rich singing voice to the dusty, repurposed jazz of \"Endeavors For Never (The last time we spoke you said you were not here. I saw you though.)\", while partner Thee Stasia raps over the hard, roboticized boom bap of album closer \"Swerve... The reeping of all that is worthwhile (Noir not withstanding)\". That the last sound you hear on the album is one of THEESatisfactions voices echoing out into the ether feels like an anointment and a look ahead (news that Sub Pop signed the duo leaked back in February).\nFor all his recent (relative) forthrightness, Butler is still fascinated by arts ability to communicate what conversations cannot. \"I cant explain it with words/ I have to do it,\" he raps on one song; on another, he delivers one of the albums catchiest, most motivating maxims: \"If you talk about it, its a show/ But if you move about it, then its a go.\" Beyond the \"just do it\" swooshing of these lines is a meatier paradox: that Butler uses a lyrical form to decry the limitations of words and exalt the meaningfulness of action. In Shabazz Palaces, Butler enacts the union of these opposites-- words as action, action into words-- and its no exaggeration to call this transmutation what it is: magic.",

        "article_text": "Alongside the roaring Harlem rapper Vado, Rhode Island native AraabMuzik has been one of the key figures in the re-emergence of Camron, Dipsets language-bending figurehead. After a long period of complete disappearance, Cams been going through something of a comeback lately, aided in large part by tracks like Araabs punishing \"Get It in Ohio\". Araabs work for Cam, and for other freelance clients, sounds dollar-store cheap but knife-edge tense; it reminds me of Steve Jablonskys score for Friday the 13th. He makes ferocious, diamond-hard gangsta rap beats with a pervading sense of dystopic anxiety. Araabs sense of vision comes through even more strongly in the web videos hes been releasing, in which he shows off his MPC virtuosity and slices up samples of, oh, say, Cannibal Corpse. Like fellow underground rap visionaries Clams Casino and DJ Burn One, Araab makes freelance beats that hint at a fully developed personal aesthetic. And like those guys, hes now striking out on his own, making instrumental music that brings that aesthetic to the forefront.\nElectronic Dream is Araabs first commercially available album, but it works more like a collection of remixes. Rather than creating his own tracks from scratch, Araab spends his debut album dismembering a series of cheesed-out hairgel-house superclub anthems: DJ Nosferatus \"The Underground Stream\" on \"Underground Stream\", Jam \u0026 Spoons \"Right in the Night (Fall in Love With Music)\" on \"Golden Touch\", Starchasers \"So High\" on \"Feelin So Hood\". This is, to put it mildly, an unexpected direction for Araab. With a little bit of Googling, you can find plenty of online screeds from fans frustrated or even enraged at Araab for making an album based on this music, or for dishonoring his sample sources by leaving large pieces of these tracks unchanged while neglecting to properly credit the original producers. But Araabs changes, relatively minor though they may be, turn a sound built on populist uplift into something darker.\nIts tough to imagine the tracks on Electronic Dream getting any play in any dance club in the world, and its virtually impossible to picture anyone rapping over them. Instead, this album is a genre unto itself-- ominous future shit that creates an atmosphere but never bleeds into the background. Araabs snare-hits resonate like eye-punches, and his drum-programming is pure, unrelenting rap shit. But hes applying that sensibility to songs where the melodies shine even when Araabs using a screaming sound effect as part of the rhythm track. The end result is a truly weird little album-- something at once anxious and euphoric.\nAs hard as his drums punch, though, Araab still let the textures of these anthems shine through. And in Araabs hands, these melodies work differently; the anonymous dance divas wailing ecstatically over their original beats become lost, lonely souls, anxiously whispering to themselves that everything will be OK. Araabs music doesnt allow for dizzy buildups and cathartic breakdowns; instead, its all murky tension, all the time. At times, his tracks can sound a bit like the woozy bass music of L.A.s Brainfeeder scene, but Araab is always more direct and more ferocious than those guys. And yet the sugary beauty of those melodies sound like they belong on his tracks; nothing is out of place. \"Got a feelin so high,\" the singer on \"Feelin So Hood\" coos, and the drums beat that feeling down while the gorgeous ripples of synth lift it back up.\nTheres something truly fascinating about the entire LP: An up-and-coming hardcore rap producer leaving his genre behind so that he can twist and scramble this hands-in-the-air big-room sound. And in peeling back its excesses and substituting in his own eccentricities, Araab uncovers a primal emotional force in this music, one that fits beautifully with his own air-raid siren aesthetic. Electronic Dream is pretty, but its pretty like the morning sun twinkling off of a dangling machete blade-- you dont want to fuck with it.",

        "article_text": "The second full-length from Hundred Waters is not an evolution so much as a refinement. If 2012’s self-titled effort saw the band sketching out the borders of their sound, The Moon Rang Like a Bell finds them zeroing in on what they do best and going deeper. The production is improved in every way, but given how hushed and quiet they can be, the effect is still pretty subtle. Acoustic instruments have been jettisoned; the pillowy synths and layered vocals of singer Nicole Miglis nestle easily in the mix, sometimes leaving questions as to when one end and another begins. Indeed, the key to Hundred Waters’ rich and tactile atmosphere is that their machines never sound quite like machines, but everything sounds close; on “Murmurs”, distant piano is buried under reverb and digital crackle, sketching out chords with a vaguely gospel feel, as a strange voice sings a tune while so near to the microphone you can hear a tongue clicking against teeth. It’s an album that always feels like it’s whispering in your ear.\nThe band’s approach is difficult to place in a specific time. That’s not because their aesthetic is especially innovative or new, or because it seems like it’s from the future; rather, they bring to mind a moment when updating dusty old song structures with the tools of the present seemed like the next logical step in music. “Digital folk” was the term used in a review of their self-titled debut, and that captures it as well as anything: music that is both earthy and disembodied, with humans and electronics joining at some blissful halfway point. Hundred Waters thrive in the place where post-rock meets freak folk, and sing-song melodies are twisted into strange shapes by circuitry.\nThe connection to Björk is hard to overstate. Part of The Moon’s appeal is that it hearkens back to the style of Vespertine, the last album when Björk’s restlessly experimental music still had a foot in accessibility, before she took such a conceptual turn. There’s a similar sense of music-as-place here, and a desire to fuse ancient and modern in search of a new mode of expression. And in that respect, oddly enough, Hundred Waters remind me of another group from Iceland—Múm, in particular their 2000 album Yesterday Was Dramatic—Today is OK, an album sometimes described at the time as “folktronica.” These aren’t influences I’m talking about, necessarily, but ways of hearing what Hundred Waters are doing. It’s not a coincidence that these signposts are from music made around the turn of the millennium, when rapidly changing technology meant the future sound of pop was up in the air.\nBut if much of Björk’s power comes from her unpredictability, the feeling that a breathy sight could turn into a scream and a song might explode, Hundred Waters are always set to simmer. That mostly works in their favor on The Moon Rang Like a Bell, as the album’s strength comes from its gradually accruing moments. So the spell of the minute-long a cappella opener “Show Me Love” is broken by clear piano chords and miniature percussive explosions on “Murmurs” and then the following “Cavity” raises the intensity before the bright and twinkly “Out Alee” brings it back to earth. Sequenced beautifully, the record is full of these gentle arcs, and the sound is so consistent it can feel like a 49-minute piece broken into 12 movements. The impact of any one song is heightened by its proximity to what came before and what follows.\nIn an interview, Miglis highlighted the importance of her lyrics to The Moon Rang Like a Bell, but for me the album functions more like an instrumental album, where meaning comes from the sonics. On the page, her words are allusive and fragmented, hinting at moments of doubt and turmoil, but on record, the words come over as pure sound. There’s a moment about halfway through “Innocent” where Miglis breaks away from language and sings a “dah-dah-dah-do-dum” phrase, but with her voice coated in processed fuzz, she sounds like an amphibious creature prone to reverie. This line communicates as well as any phrase on the album. “Is it only in my head?”, she asks a moment later, and it wouldn’t be a bad subtitle for an album so steeped in imagination.",

        "article_text": "When Phosphorescents Matthew Houck came off the road in support of his last album, 2010s Heres to Taking it Easy, he was mentally and physically exhausted, uncertain he wanted to make another Phosphorescent record. So he dispatched himself to Tulum, a small community in Mexico, where, he said, \"I just checked out of my life for a while.\" As he took long solitary walks in the woods and swam, the pieces of what would become Muchacho began taking shape in his mind.\nAs with everything Houck does as Phosphorescent, from 2007s urban-rustic classic Pride to his 2009 Willie Nelson tribute record, this little story has an endearingly second-hand ring to it, as if Houck was obediently following the dictates of some dog-eared country-drifter playbook tucked in his back pocket. But this credulousness is also key to his music, which glows with simple reverence and purity. On Muchacho, Houck gathers together everything hes attempted-- beery, rollicking country-rock, haunted tribal hymnals, regret-soaked bar room heartbreak-- and fashions it into something close to a defining statement.\nThe first layer of Muchacho to savor is the simple gloriousness of its sound. Houck records his music largely alone, bringing in key players for individual parts but crafting the end results meticulously, in isolation. With the assistance of engineer John Agnello (Kurt Vile, Male Bonding), he has produced a bright, rich, warmly three-dimensional record, one that fuses the headed-for-the-big-city bar-rock signifiers of Heres to Taking it Easy with the night-sky awe of his earliest work. In fact, the album feels like a daylight version of Pride, a point hammered home by the contrast between that albums \"Be Dark Night\" and this ones two book-ending hymnals.\nAccordingly, listening to Muchacho often feels like being warmed by afternoon sun as it floods your window. Every sound is lovingly recorded and given a cradle of space: The rounded pop of the drum track on \"Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master)\", paired with tumbles of upright piano and softly pattering bongos; the dryly whispering bowed harmonics that open \"A Charm/A Blade\"; the mournful little mariachi trumpet solo winding through the country waltz of \"Down to Go\". The first thing we hear on the record, introducing the opening \"Sun\" hymnal, is a dreamlike, welcoming major-key synth flutter. Those synths reappear on \"Song For Zula\", mingling with crystalline threads of pedal steel guitar, lifting countrys signature instrument further heavenward.\nAt the center of all these majestic noises sits Houck himself. His voice is an unreliable instrument-- reedy, hiccuping, prone to cutting out entirely mid-note-- but he plies it heartbreakingly, never more than on Muchacho. On \"Sun, Arise!\" and \"A New Anhedonia\", he stacks himself into massed, keening layers, like a church full of choirboys. It’s a technique that he’s used before, but he has never sounded as overwhelming as he does here. The persistent catch in his voice, meanwhile gives him an unstable, baby chick fragility, magnifying the pathos of a line like, \"See honey I am not some broken thing/ I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee\" from \"Song For Zula\".\nOne of Muchachos main thematic concerns is redemption, and it’s one Houck explores with his customary ringing, allegorical language. Sometimes his writing grows so high-flown that it eludes sense: \"I was the wounded master, and I was the slave… I was the holy lion, and I was the cage/ I was the bleeding actor, and I was the stage,\" he sings on \"Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master)\". More straightforward is this, from \"Muchacho’s Tune\": \"See I was slow to understand/ This river’s bigger than I am/ It’s running faster than I can, though lord I tried.\" It’s a simple sentiment, pitched somewhere south of Zen koan and just north of heartland-rock cliche, and it maps out the coordinates of Houck’s world: It’s a place where well-worn sounds are the most beloved, where ideas and poses are settled into like old chairs. On Muchacho, Houck invests this world with new beauty and profundity. ",

        "article_text": "Gothenburg, located on the west coast of Sweden, averages highs in the upper 60s in June; in recent years, however, the city has produced some of the sunniest music in the world. Tropical rhythms and warm-weather themes color releases by Jens Lekman, the Tough Alliance, Studio, and the Embassy-- all of whom have recorded for Gothenburg-based label Service. TTA and Studio have since founded their own labels, each with its own cryptic website. Signed to TTAs Sincerely Yours, Air France invited listeners to their \"Beach Party\" with last years too-good-to-be-true On Trade Winds EP. Air Frances latest, the 23-minute No Way Down EP, is better.\nThe seaside disco of the Gothenburg groups shares many traits with the DJ-ing style named after the Balearic archipelago, off the coast of Spain. Dreamed up on the Balearic island of Ibiza by Argentina-born DJ Alfredo Fiorito in the mid-1980s and soon brought to London, the sound spanned laid-back, groove-oriented music ranging from conga-accented Italo disco and the iridescent proto-techno of Manuel Göttschings classic E2-E4 to hypnotic indie rock by the Woodentops and offbeat selections from soft-rock, prog, and global pop music. As a DJ-centered art, Balearic house was inherently based on manipulations of other peoples music.\nBalearic is far from the only musical perspective that can unite an eclectic variety of records without regard to genre or historical context. As the KLF observed in their book The Manual: How to Have a Number One the Easy Way, \"All records in the Top 10 (especially those that get to #1) have far more in common with each other than with whatever genre they have developed from or sprung out of.\" Thats true from \"Take Five\" to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". What distinguishes the music of Air France and their Sincerely Yours colleagues from the more rock- and groove-oriented sounds of Studio or Norwegian cosmic disco DJs like Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje is that theyve taken to heart not only Balearic, but also the teachings of chart pop.\nAir France use elements of both Balearic and pop to create their sumptuous, sincere fantasy world. In that respect, Air Frances No Way Down-- currently import-only outside of Sweden except as 320 kbps mp3s-- is reminiscent of the Avalanches dazzlingly great Since I Left You, another record that finds wide-eyed delight in silly stuff like truth, beauty, and fun, as well as Jens Lekmans Night Falls Over Kortedala and the Tough Alliances A New Chance. It imagines an impossibly idyllic place through sounds that probably could never have been performed that way in real life. Though its been said, many times, many ways: Welcome to paradise.\nUnlike Balearic disco contemporaries such as Studio or A Mountain of One, No Way Down does childlike joy, not hypnotized headiness. Typewriter-like clicks and John Williams-ready horn fanfares, complete with tympani, introduce the opener, \"Maundy Thursday\". This track soon settles into chilled-out synth washes and sober piano melodies, establishing a tone of sincerity without sacrificing lush outdoor beauty. The swooning string flourishes on finale \"Windmill Wedding\" arent far off from the introduction to hip-hop producer Bangladeshs ubiqitous beat for Lil Waynes \"A Milli\". Electric guitar and piano ripple across each other like waves, giving way to Spanish-tinged guitar, percussive human breaths, broken-up female vocals, church bells, and bird chirps. The coup de grâce: the whinnying of a horse. You can almost picture someones gallant lover galloping across the surf.\nOther tracks are more in the foamy wake of the groups breakout indie late-2006 track \"Beach Party\". \"Collapsing at Your Doorstep\" is gorgeously produced, stupidly catchy, and totally affecting, with an elegant dance groove and an infectious hook. The verses throw lyrics to the wind in favor of wildlife sounds, congas, and woodwinds, which bask in harp glissandos and Göttsching-esque guitar filigrees, plus some string and horn samples. \"No more, no more, no more, no morals anymore/ Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door,\" a woman seems to be singing, followed by childrens voices: \"Sorta like a dream?\" \"No -- better.\" Nearly as perfect is \"No Excuses\", with handclaps and a yearning chorus: \"No excuses left/ Waiting to fail, but not quite yet.\" Its like Saint Etienne for an endless summer.\nAs with many other gifted pop and Balearic artists, Air France also happen to be sticky-fingered. Their sources are varied, yet the pleasure isnt recognizing the different sonic elements, but in relishing their almost supernatural co-existence. \"Beach Party\" lifted its hook from Lisa Stansfield. The No Way Down title track directly quotes the Happy Mondays. The melancholy intro that precedes Go! Team-esque horns and cheers on \"June Evenings\" is from late-1980s TV fantasy-romance \"Beauty and the Beast\", as are the childrens voices on \"Collapsing at Your Doorstep\", describing both the shows fantastical underground world and the joy of being with someone you love. If No Way Down is about a place that doesnt exist, its a place where fairy tales are true and where old pop culture ephemera can-- in Air Frances fertile musical imagination, at least-- live happily ever after.",

        "article_text": "A few dozen \"2006: Year of You\" think pieces later, we know a lot about \"You\": Web 2.0 has democratized the media, caught the eye of corporations from Silicon Valley to Detroit, and sparked new ways to call em as we see em. However, the rise of user-generated content has also accelerated the conversion of gestalt experience into symbolic form-- most basically, 1s and 0s-- and something usually gets lost in this translation. If Im busy recording a moment, how can I be fully present in it? What most defines our lives nearly always defies documentation.\nNo wonder Swedens Sally Shapiro prefers to keep her offline self to herself. Shapiro reputedly declines to be photographed by strangers, and she, like 1980s Italo disco singer Valerie Dore, records under an English pseudonym. (Shapiro hasnt told us her real name, and she doesnt do interviews-- if \"she\" exists at all.) Just six months ago, songwriter/producer Johan Agebjörn started posting on message boards announcing her debut 12\" \"Ill Be By Your Side\"-- Pitchforks #27 track of 2006. Not since Tigermilk-era Belle and Sebastian has an artist gotten so much publicity from refusing to do publicity. Here, as then, such reticence befits the music, which speaks, sensitively and eloquently, for itself.\n\"Ill Be By Your Side\" returns to open Shapiros first full-length, Disco Romance. Like Tigermilks \"The State I Am In\", its an auspicious introduction to an, ohhh, introverted world. Agebjörns Italo-inspired tracks build gradually, drop melodies that could melt whatever global warming leaves behind, and then hold on for dear life. Shapiros guileless vocals put an angelic face on her producers melancholy, but she, too, is clinging to the past. Disco Romance is deeply nostalgic. Its the nostalgia of someone who has loved and lost and knows damn well it was indeed \"better\"-- no matter how gnawing the present hurt.\nSure, Italos comeback has been here for years. Just ask Morgan Geist, Alec DeRuggiero, Hans-Peter Lindstrøm, or Mrs. Guy Ritchie. Fundamentally a modern indie pop album (dig the cover arts references to old Heavenly and Field Mice design schemes), Disco Romance uses its sonic heritage not so much as a blueprint as for thematic material. Though German label ZYX Music didnt coin the term until 1983, Italo disco began when the strings, horns, and sweaty glitz of the Village People, K.C. \u0026 the Sunshine Band, or \"Disco Duck\" gave way to something new: an electronic-based amalgam of throbbing bass lines, aching synth arpeggios, and low-tech drum thuds. Like 80s house or 90s lo-fi, the genre that sprang almost fully formed from Giorgio Moroders knobs, via Donna Summers \"I Feel Love\", was cheap and easy to imitate.\nIn Agebjörns hands, Italo is also essentially sad: Perhaps the first dance music made in solitude. \"Ill Be By Your Side\" draws its emotional depth from the way the arrangement implicitly contradicts Shapiros vows of eternal togetherness. Detouring into intergalactic lounge, \"I Know\" shows its lonely narrators struggle to go on believing those promises. If Shapiro really knows, then why does she have to keep telling herself so-- why are those squiggly synth solos so tragic? \"Just tell me how I can hold onto this moment for now,\" she asks. The key changes, bass dives, and our moment extends for another two minutes.\nBack on paper, the album should be as giddy as it makes Pitchfork HQ. After all, Agebjörns love-oriented songs mostly polish up the simple, frequently nonsensical lyrics of classic Italo. \"Be mine in the sunshine,\" Shapiro sings on \"Hold Me So Tight\", but its beneath a deluge of rainy-day synths. Even on \"Anorak Christmas\", a cover of Swedish twee-poppers Nixon, Shapiro sings the words \"please dont go away\" as if she doesnt plan to be heard. \"Find My Soul\" reaches out a trembling hand, and ambient lullaby \"Sleep in My Arms\" is as desolate as a Star Trek captains log. Disco Romance turns the Smiths happy-music-with-sad-lyrics formulation on its head-- and then you dance to it.\nYep, style is ephemeral. Agebjörn cant bring back vanished innocence by recreating the sounds of our youth any more than Shapiro can keep love alive just by saying the words. They can, however, control the emotional experience of anyone who has ears-- now, and as long as their songs remain available in some form. Disco Romance takes historys revision process into its own hands with two remixes, one a slick \"Norwegian electrojazz\" take on \"Find My Soul\" and the other Netherlands electro artist Rude66s vocoder-ghostly, acid-squelched \"Ill Be By Your Side\" revamp. Theyre not new songs, but they provide another means of prolonging the present.\nThe Webs cacophony privileges criticism. You wont find God in scriptural commentaries, or save any children watching Hotel Rwanda, but you can fall in love to \"My Love\" (in theory). If verbalization is inherently reductive, then writing about music is a way to encode the moment loss-free. The track always endures. In his book Air Guitar, MacArthur Fellowship-winning arts critic Dave Hickey explains: \"Even though my writing about art might momentarily intervene between some object and its beholders, the words would wash away, and the writing, if it was written successfully into its historical instant, could never actually replace the work or banish it into the realm of knowledge.\" All that lasts is music; Shapiro and Agebjörn know.",

        "article_text": "Pin a single label, style, adjective on Isis and it slips right off. They seem immune. For more than a decade, the Los Angeles five-piece has maneuvered between cries and whispers, dirt and polish, bruising noise and narcotic subtlety, repeatedly redrawing the borders of the one genre that accommodates them, metal, as they annex more sonic territory beyond it. This means trading metals usual symphony of downtuned riffs for a broader set of digressions and moods: On new album Wavering Radiant, these self-professed Fennesz and Pink Floyd devotees have turned often-drab contemporary guitar rock into music flush with fresh emotions and ideas-- a triumph that owes to the casual restraint of Joe Barresis production. Moving away from the analytic approach favored by longtime Isis producer Matt Bayles, collecting the entire band in one place, and writing without a deadline has lent Radiant a sense of completeness and unity that recalls album-rocks golden years.\nWavering Radiant continues the shifts made on 2006s In the Absence of Truth-- namely, more elaborate sonics and increased rhythmic variety-- while also emphasizing the finer points of tempo and, especially, melody. Melodicism not only adds a new dimension to Isis music but another way to raise the tension, by silhouetting those melodies against their slabs of dissonance. As singer Aaron Turner told MTV, the potent, parallel forms of their past work-- one instrument tailing the other-- gave way in Absence to a flowing conversation of instruments. The effect there, and more so here, is a veto on thickness for the sake of thickness: The mix instead is stacked with accents and pairings that surprise and complement one another rather than feel redundant.\nEqually vital to the records dense, hypnotic shape is Clifford Meyers command of the keyboard. Lingering organ lines seep into the pores and cracks of each track, leaving tiers of texture that brighten up the dark spots. For the most part, Meyer is more active than that though: His blissful, knotty phrases, played on a dusty Hammond B3 or Rhodes, often recreate moments from the psychedelic and prog-rock past. Along the same lines, the title track and the effects-laden finale \"Threshold of Transformation\" capture this feeling of retro reverie. Whether it is this brand of low-key ambience or the rhythm sections siege attack, these songs are spread across the entire dynamic range, starting with an enveloping, ruthlessly direct low end.\nThat solidity comes at the start: \"Hall of the Dead\" may be the lushest, most astutely crafted opener in the Isis discography. Fans of their earlier work will welcome the jerky first riff, but soon the grind of Celestial (2001) or the Mosquito Control EP (1998) fades away, leaving the track bobbing in sludge. Harris doesnt take it lying down, drawing menace and beauty in equal parts from his kit. Turner works similar wonders-- his clearer-than-ever voice stands out at times over the murky compositions while blending into the loud, surrounding dark at others. Not that you can understand everything he says. On the first track, the pattern of bellows and roars calls to mind Nancy and Lees \"Some Velvet Morning\", except Turner makes it a one-man duet. The brawny thump of \"Stone to Wake a Serpent\" has him belting in both his clean and hoarse styles, too, and though the words are unintelligible, the multiple personalities of his voice nicely mirror the guitars many incarnations on that track-- crunchy explosions of fuzz, depressed twangs, banshee shrieks.\nTrack for track, Wavering Radiant is the smartest and richest record in Isis catalog: Here they manage not just to build on, but also to inventively weld together, their past work into one interlocking whole. Naysayers who cast off In the Absence of Truth as too subdued ought to don their headphones again: There was a sense of fastidious craft and atmosphere that may take repeated spins to sink in. And the same goes for the far superior Wavering Radiant. Easily the bands most accessible effort, hipsters and headbangers will likely agree its also their most intricately imagined. To luxuriate in the details, to fully receive the melodies and tones and the bewildering interplay of every element, Isis demand not merely active, not athletic, but something like Olympic listening.",

        "article_text": "It would be difficult to argue that the Feedelity label remains a well-kept secret now that its founder and main artist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm has become such a ubiquitous presence in dance music. If anything, its tempting to ask whether, in October 2006, its too late to get excited about Lindstrøms brand of epic disco revivalism. However, Its a Feedelity Affair is packed with tried-and-true musical strategies for putting on a spectacle, and this overdue round-up of some of the greater and lesser-known Lindstrøm tracks off his 10 or so vinyl releases from the past few years makes clear that the Norwegian artists production style remains as invigorating as ever, despite many of these deeply familiar tunes now approaching half a decade in age. Can we chalk this resilience up to timelessness, or simply good timing?\nPartly its just that disco never goes out of fashion. In dance music the question is always \"which disco?\", and its a feature of Lindstrøms music that it would feel at home alongside so many of the responses to this question that have been offered in the past decade, from the classicist disco of Faze Action in the late 1990s, to Metro Areas italo-disco, to the (so hot right now) ramshackle \"hippie\" disco peddled by RubNTug and the like. If the narrative arc of this crate-digging strand of disco fetishism moves from precision and chops to bleary swirl and ecumenical unpredictability, the secret to Lindstrøms music is how it manages to be all these things at once. Even at his briskest and most uptempo (see the efficient pump of the appropriately titled early single \"Fast and Delirious\"), Lindstrøm cant resist woozy synth effects, pompous chord changes, and atmospheric percussion; conversely, the collections most hippy moment, the torpid dub-disco of \"Music (In My Mind)\" (complete with deliciously smacked-out female vocals) nonetheless retains a delicate, expensive muso sheen.\nIts a Feedelity Affair largely foregoes the multi-hued fragrancy and soft-rock glide of Lindstrøms recent work with Prins Thomas in favour of ostentatiously astral motifs (particularly roaming, noodly synth solos) and more pronounced dancefloor grooves, and it invites the conclusion that the producers strongest solo efforts are also his most tunnel-visioned. The albums lofty peaks are the now instantly recognisable chill sci-fi sheen of \"I Feel Space\" and the stately, widescreen bleeps of new track \"The Contemporary Fix\", whose stereopanning percussion, shards of glistening dulcimer, and endlessly percolating 303 bass aspire to a majestic strain of minimalism that could go anywhere. Its difficult to know whether Lindstrøm would be better served pursuing this line of flight from plush disco, or to follow the path hes taken with Thomas, concocting ever-more sumptuous flights of multi-instrumentalist fancy, such as on their gorgeous, Henrik Schwarz-style remix of Toscas \"Zuri\". Either way, its probably a good idea for him to now steer clear of the warm space-disco which dominates Its a Feedelity Affair, if only because theres little point in attempting to top his past achievements.\nStill, even during the most representative and unashamedly retro moments here-- such as on the voluptuous 10-minute suite \"Theres a Drink in My Bedroom and I Need a Hot Lady\"-- Lindstrøm resists charges of being a one-trick pony, weaving together an unlikely assortment of elements in tracks that continually (if often subtly) change direction. The criticism is not entirely off-base: There is something almost gimmicky about his lush, organic instrumentation and overblown psych-out synth climaxes. But while Lindstrøm may be a showpony, his posturing is hard to resent when his tried-and-true strategies are deployed so decadently, almost carelessly, like stray crumbs escaping from a bottomless bag of tricks.",

        "article_text": "One of the great everlasting indie rock adages: \"If this band ever got on the radio, theyd be huge.\" I mean, why couldnt Sonic Youth have been the best selling group of the 1990s? What did My Bloody Valentine record if not great pop songs? Wolf Eyes is a classic singles band! Sad but true: This old wisdom doesnt fly. Though its harbored its share of forward-thinking songwriters and producers, independent music isnt traditionally thought of as user-friendly. And although its recent ascent in popularity has allowed its most accessible bands brief bouts with commercial success, the culture is still mostly populated by artists whose music is too difficult, challenging, or in some cases, annoying, to appeal to anyone but the smallest minority.\nIn his decade-long run as the ringleader of art-rock collective the Danielson Famile, Daniel Smith has practically defined the term \"cult artist.\" His records-- most of them highly conceptual paeans to God-- can be exhausting, barraging listeners with surprise twists and turns and tangled song fragments. Smith himself has an inimitable vocal style: a twisted melange of bleating, twinging yelps, whoops, and screeches. Yet Smiths discography has yielded him a small but unflaggingly loyal congregation, drawn to music that, above all else, is uninhibitedly gleeful, celebratory, and rallying-- the kind of inspired communal rejoicing thats highly contagious.\nThough Ive long admired Smiths idiosyncratic vision, navigating his musics quirks and structural obstacles hasnt always been wholly rewarding. But after two years spent refining his approach in his Clarksboro studio, hes re-emerged with an album that serves as the resolution of his recorded output: the spectacular Ships. Harnessing a work ethic so steadfast its presence is felt throughout the albums entire duration, here Smith distills the best and most unique attributes of his sound, and marries that creative concentrate to a grander, more cinematic sensibility. The result is staggeringly triumphant-- the blustering, ambitious consummation of all hes worked toward.\nInitially recruiting likeminded noise-pop explorers Deerhoof as his backing band, Smiths ambitions for the album eventually found him corralling a total of 20 musicians, including all Famile past and present, Anticon alumnus Why?, members of Serena Maneesh and Half-Handed Cloud, and longtime Danielson acolyte Sufjan Stevens. So many mismatched contributors could have turned the album into a chaotic melée of disparate ideas. Instead, the sound only grew greater and more colossal with every added hand-- one more instrument in a superdense wall of beautifully ramshackle orchestration that creaks and groans beneath its own enormous weight.\nThat weight is Ships cornerstone. None of Smiths previous records-- and in fact, very few indie releases this year-- have flat-out rocked like this one, with blaring trumpets signaling snares to exact their force beneath sweeping multitracked vocal choruses that simply wont stop crescendoing. On standouts like \"Ship the Majestic Suffix\" and \"Bloodbook on the Half Shell\", the music builds to such immense heights, and increases tension so far past the expected breaking point, that the inevitable release is nearly dizzying. But Smith also grasps the inherent malleability of such a sizable ensemble, and though he most often uses it to breathe life into the albums darkly apocalyptic overtures, he also wisely crafts shimmering psychedelic passages that prevent it from becoming too claustrophobic.\nOf course, while vastly more accessible and streamlined than Smiths other outings, Ships is, in that same vein, very much a cult record. And like other recent, successful cult records-- the Fiery Furnaces Blueberry Boat, Animal Collectives Sung Tongs, and earlier this week, Scott Walkers The Drift-- the elements that make it so refreshing and exciting to some listeners are certain to put off others. Smiths vocals, for instance, are significantly calmer and less abrasive here than ever, but his charismatic chirps and squawks may be an obstacle for even some seasoned fans of yelpy indie rock. And while they offer Smith the opportunity to achieve a number of unusual melodic feats, the unpredictable song structures may initially throw some listeners for a loop.\nStill, the fact that it lacks some of the broader appeal of independent musics more orthodox practitioners also allows more room for the kind of weirdness and experimentation that makes Ships such a fascinating listen, and indeed, such a watershed in Smiths development as an artist. Its the kind of album he may spend the rest of his career trying to top-- and in the closing track, charmingly titled \"Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up\", he seems to recognize it. With wide-eyed bewilderment, amidst the clash and clang of cymbals and triangles, butterfly flutes, manic guitar strums, ascending eight-part harmonies, and surprise key changes, the euphoric message is reiterated: \"Thanks, thaaaaaanks, thaaaaaaaaaanks!!!!\"",

        "article_text": "With Menomena, you always get a total package. Their first album, 2003s I Am the Fun Blame Monster, came with a hand-assembled flip book, complete with moving anagrams. The vinyl edition took the packaging a step further: It folded up into an origami monster with a moving mouth. Their second outing, a minimalist ballet score cutely titled Under an Hour, came in a stark, mostly white container that looked a lot like the music it contained. And Friend and Foe, their third, has possibly the most brilliantly executed cover art of the decade.\nIllustrated by Craig Thompson of \"Blankets\" fame, the front cover has eight possible permutations, four when the CD is in the case, and four when its in the player (itll be there a lot)-- and thats not counting all of the slight variations you can get by rotating the disc when its in the tray. The drawings-- a hellish, humorous freak universe on their own-- are punched with holes to reveal other worlds behind them, full of characters, snippets of lyrics, and the record-fetching dog from the Barsuk logo.\nMost cover art frankly isnt even worth talking about in the CD age, but this is so unique that it warrants deeper discussion than I can give it here. And speaking of the total package, Menomena deliver just as spectacularly on record. While Under an Hour could rightly have been seen as a detour or stopgap after Blame Monster, Friend and Foe follows through on the potential of their unique sound, proving their wildly great debut was no fluke.\nMenomena dont even give you time to doubt them. Their signature modular pop is at its most effective on opener \"Musclen Flo\". Crashing drums lead you in, dropping out after just seconds in favor of a pulsating bassline and the prosodically delivered line, \"In the morning I stumble towards the mirror.\" From this sparse beginning, the music blossoms with brimming intricacy, adding slashing guitar as the drums kick back in with a vengeance. The song is a total rollercoaster, eventually collapsing into a quiet interlude that sets up a brilliant moment where an organ figure that had been a barely noticeable background component suddenly rises to the fore and leads into a beautiful, floating passage of impassioned vocal harmonies. And thats just one of dozens of ingenious, spine-tingling details offered on the album.\nThe bands technique of building songs from improvised loops arranged with custom software yields bigger, more developed compositions and stronger songwriting than on records past. \"Wet and Rusting\" is one of their most conventionally memorable songs to date, but also one of their most interestingly varied, as the textures that lie beneath the vocals constantly shift. It places the same rushing piano passage over two completely different rhythm tracks and makes it sound amazing both ways. \"The Pelican\" is a relentless stomp, nearly matched a few tracks later by \"Weird\", whose intense beat and ominous low-end groan slides through a tricky meter.\nWith the exception of the majestic, fractured pop of \"My My\", the back half of the album is a great deal more abstract than the front, as it was on their debut. \"Evil Bee\" revolves around the refrain, \"O, to be a machine/ O, to be wanted/ O, to be useful,\" and backs up the sentiment with strangely mechanical sounds that seem to have been created by processing recorded drum hits-- the bassline is crazy and intensely melodic, and they use the same vocal phrase about five different ways over all manner of instrumentation, including a heavy baritone sax riff and an fluidly ascendant, synth-saturated buildup.\nOnce youve listened through a couple of times, its stunning how many clever and exciting moments stick with you-- music this full of ideas, sections and material can come across as overstuffed, but this feels just right almost everywhere. Their previous two albums worked because of their stripped, immediate simplicity; Friend and Foe works just as well moving away from that approach and shows dimensions of the band-- especially in the vocal department-- that werent apparent before. In fact, the biggest concern one might come away from Friend and Foe with is whether the band can top it next time.",

        "article_text": "Over its seven-year gestation, Christmas on Mars had come to represent everything wonderful and frustrating about the Flaming Lips. As much as we loved the idea of Wayne Coyne producing a sci-fi flick in his backyard with hardware-store materials, the Lips musical production became less frequent-- and less consistent-- during its making. 2006s scattershot At War With the Mystics tried to cut down on the lightness of their two previous landmark albums but was largely overwhelmed by cloying singles (\"The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song\", \"Free Radicals\") that felt like little more than excuses to shoot off their confetti cannons. The trios desire to produce crowd-pleasing spectacle-- whether on stage or on film-- had seemingly taken priority over their desire to be a band.\nBut when Christmas on Mars finally surfaced in late 2008, it came with a peace offering to fans longing for a return to the bands bizarro roots: a full-length soundtrack of unsettling instrumentals that conjured the films icy desolation. Now, rather than close a chapter on this seven-year saga, the Flaming Lips have taken a dramatic left turn with their Mystics follow-up-- the double album Embryonic is the bands most audacious undertaking since 1997s Zaireeka. The sprawling 70-minute marathon ruminates on themes of madness, isolation, and hallucinogenic horror, translating them into an unrelentingly paranoid, static-soaked acid-rock epic. Embryonic actually feels like it was produced in one of Christmas on Mars hermetic space-station labs, with squelching equipment that takes a few moments to warm up and frequent instructional studio chatter that gives the impression of a subject under observation.\nTheres a raw directness to Embryonic thats been largely absent from Lips records since the mid-90s. For the first time in years, theyve made an album that actually sounds like a band playing live together in a small room. In light of Mystics overly processed, grab-bag quality, the holistic, audio-vérité approach on display here is remarkable-- the record is extremely dense, initially overwhelming, but unusually rewarding upon repeat listens. Like the double-disc, high-concept rock epics of yore (think Physical Graffiti or Bitches Brew), it captures them at their most sprawling and ambitious, boldly pushing themselves towards more adventurous horizons.\nMusically, too, Embryonic leans heavily on the Lips formative 60s/70s psych-rock influence (like In a Priest Driven Ambulances \"Take Meta Mars\" before it, Embryonics formidable opener \"Convinced of the Hex\" grooves heavily on Cans \"Mushroom\"), but never before has the band recorded an album so unwaveringly sinister, or so devoid of pop-song levity. (Hell, even Zaireeka had \"The Big Ol Bug Is the New Baby Now\".) Wayne Coyne no longer assumes the role of the endearingly creaky, puppet-toting crooner. Instead, hes a world-weary fatalist describing scenes of environmental holocaust in a chillingly unaffected monotone on the rampaging \"See the Leaves\". Or hes a cult leader deviously summoning his minions on \"Sagittarius Silver Announcement\", before leading them to a fiery demise on the monstrous, stoner-metal onslaught of \"Worm Mountain\" (featuring fuzzbox-stomping assistance from MGMT). The atmosphere of dread reaches its fever pitch in the albums spellbinding seven-minute centerpiece \"Powerless\", where, over top a coolly ominous bass riff, Coynes nervous verses yield to a Syd Barrett-on-Mandrax guitar freak out.\nThere are brief respites amid Embryonics thundering eruptions, but even these carry a calm-before-the-storm unease: On paper, \"I Can Be a Frog\" reads like another of Coynes animal-populated nursery rhymes, but the foreboding orchestration and giggly background squawks (courtesy of Karen O) render it too creepy for kindergarten. And the vocoderized lullaby \"The Impulse\" serves only to make the screaming intro to strobe-lit freakout \"Silver Trembling Hands\" all the more startling. True to an album named Embryonic, there are tracks that arent fully formed (namely, the drunken Bonham stumble of \"Your Bats\" or the free-psych splatter of \"Scorpio Swords\"), but even in its slighter moments, Embryonic exhibits a renewed sense of fearless freakery for a band who so recently threatened to lapse into stagy routine.\n\"I wish I could go back, go back in time,\" Coyne sings on \"Evil\", Embryonics most conventionally Lips-ian ballad, but the nostalgic impulse is immediately undercut by the admission that \"no one really ever can.\" Perhaps Coyne is anticipating the confused reactions of recent Lips converts expecting more life-affirming anthems along the lines of \"Do You Realize??\" or \"Race for the Prize\". But given the bands history, Embryonics sea change arrives right on time to herald a new Flaming Lips for a new decade. Back in 1990, In a Priest Driven Ambulance signaled the Lips transformation from garage-punk misfits into a splendorous, kaleidoscopic rock outfit; 1999s The Soft Bulletin reconfigured them once again into a sophisticated, sincere symphonic-pop troupe bestowed with increasing commercial acclaim and street-naming ceremonies in their honor. We can only hope that, as we enter the 2010s, Embryonic portends yet another new phase for the Flaming Lips-- one thats equally as improbable and rewarding as the ones that have preceded it.",

        "article_text": "My favorite trick on the opening title track to Lindstrøms Where You Go I Go Too was first revealed on his 2005 album with Prins Thomas: During long stretches of its near half-hour length, the arrangement does this wonderful and unsettling thing where the music simultaneously seems to expand outwards, curl in on itself, and then unexpectedly swerve off to the side. With its shimmering, strobing synthesizer melodies, dizzy layering, and measured rhythmic pulse, \"Where You Go I Go Too\" superficially resembles the depth of Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians and the cheesy grandeur of Tangerine Dream. But, as with his recent covers of Can (\"Mighty Girl\") and Jon \u0026 Vangelis (last years \"Let It Happen\"), its logic is all Lindstrøm: The more he embraces the work of others, the more he ends up sounding like himself.The rest of Where You Go I Go Too transposes the ambitions of the title track into shorter settings: With its floating chords and bubbly enthusiasm, \"Grand Ideas\" is close to Lindstrøms more classicist disco work and given a heightened intensity by its placement in the middle of the album, like a moment of clarity amidst the disorienting swirl. Closer \"The Long Way Home\" apes the title tracks splendor but with a twist: The synth work of its first half is complemented by hyper-manicured guitar breaks. In its second half, the track capitulates entirely to its cornier impulses, shifting into plush and suffocatingly slow electronic disco-funk.Stretching three tracks over 55 minutes and occasionally wandering far away from the dancefloor, Where You Go I Go Too has all the hallmarks of a masterpiece from a reclusive auteur. And while it shares its bloat, excess, and splendor with any number of cosmic disco or Balearic producers at the more decadent end of disco revivalism, it begs for a context more weighty than \"disco revivalism.\" Paradoxically, Lindstrøm knows all the right moves to give his own brand of spacey disco an air of transcendence, but the result feels so effortless that his facsimile and the \"real thing\" become indistinguishable-- a fake so real its beyond fake.",

        "article_text": "Rock music is all about transience. Wherever style beats substance, youth is a highly valued and unbearably scarce commodity; in rock, and particularly in more traditionally juvenile variations like emo, the hands of time are especially cruel. Bottling and selling precious youth is notoriously fickle; often, bands have long outgrown their lissome twenty-something physiques and lost all their oomph by the time they put a stamp on the completed package. And the music? It's less about conveying the universal reach of emotion than about capturing the feelings and incidental naivety of a very specific time. While we all find ourselves immersed by that glorious pocket of beauty and invincibility at some point, its attitude isn't easy to feign, and so, bands that choose not to hang it up after their sophomore release are more likely becoming The Promise Rings or The Get-Up Kids of this world than The Flaming Lips or Wilcos. The fate of Minneapolis quartet The Plastic Constellations is still very much in flux. After issuing the stellar We Got the Movement EP in 1999, which copped everyone from Fugazi to Sonic Youth in a gruff morass of youthful ingenuity, the group followed with an equally impressive debut full-length, Let's War, securing their status as promising post-punk debutantes. Then came a four-year hiatus, as the group's members done and went got some college. That's right: The Plastic Constellations' prodigious early yield was entirely the work of suburban high-schoolers. In an age rife with quixotic minstrels-- the bohemian equivalent of varsity football stars-- and lead guitarists with three-CD vocabularies, The Plastic Constellations were refined beyond their years. What's more, Let's War and We Got the Movement contained the kind of unbridled enthusiasm that usually trumps technical prowess, lyrical substance, and songwriting inventiveness in teenagers' judgments of the next local emo band. Alas, if only the patrons of Hopkins, Minnesota's underground music scene knew how lucky they were. Mazatlan, the group's emergent comeback, is full of universal qualities, but perhaps most importantly, it transports the listener back to the cozy early days of music fandom, when finding a record you loved was an episodic event, and one or two songs could occupy an entire afternoon. The Plastic Constellations aren't merely a strong outfit for their respective niche, but a mature, well-coordinated group that show great talent and even greater potential. The songs on Mazatlan resemble something conceptualized in a budding musician's hotwired brain-- virtuosity and communication between musicians being, naturally, no object-- but which so rarely get penned for the intensive and fleeting nature of the young imagination. Remarkably, the record is impressively cohesive, despite a couple questionable instances of quasi-rapping (\"Movement Momentum\", \"Vicious Devotion\") and a feeling of persistent breathlessness from the breakneck tempos. Mazatlan runs the gamut of post-punk influences, from elder heroes Sonic Youth and Fugazi to latter-day stars like Les Savy Fav and Slint. But what makes these songs truly intriguing is The Plastic Constellations' eager exploration of odd tunings and contrasting, often atonal guitar harmonies. \"Beats Like You Stole Something\" is a deftly multi-tracked example of the band's licks, opening with a twinkling riff redolent of Daydream Nation's broken music box melodies before burgeoning into a full-fledged post-punk Armada. \"Evil Groove\" amply lives up to its title, turning in some craggy unison figures and a fragile, arpeggiated bridge section that exemplifies the band's off-kilter approach to post-punk. Throughout the album, The Plastic Constellations find novel ways to reconcile seemingly incommensurable styles and motifs, and their unflagging technique is a constant boon. Whereas it took Les Savy Fav several years to tame their recalcitrant energy and release a coherent album, The Plastic Constellations have already got themselves in check. Even Mazatlan's most sophomoric tunes avoid monotony and are executed without a hitch. \"East Cleveland\" motors by in a curt 2\\xBD minutes, barely taking a breather between abrupt section changes, and yet still manages to deliver an anthemic chorus and a soaring bridge. In fact, The Plastic Constellations make a valiant effort to resurrect that sadly neglected element of effective, sophisticated pop music, bearing a bucketful of robust enjoinders. As chic as the guitar work and complex song structures may be, though, Mazatlan's most immediately winning quality is its abundance of anthemic choruses. Even if the band weren't so technically proficient, their lapses would be highly forgivable; The Plastic Constellations are easy to rally around, and their lyrics often hammer home their preciously of-the-moment aesthetic. On opener \"We Came to Play\", a febrile first verse gives way to the chorus lyric, \"We wrote this/ And laced up our shoes/ We came to play/ It's what we do.\" Such exuberance, while often obnoxious in less musically apposite contexts, suffuses Mazatlan, providing its relentless lifeblood. The lyrical onslaught is constant and unwavering, thanks to a tasteful array of rhythmic vocal harmonizing, often triple-tracked and never cloying. Lesser bands might spend a decade trying to get to this point, only to find themselves already washed up, but The Plastic Constellations make it look easy, and seem ready for more.",

        "article_text": "I stand on one side of a great divide, surrounded by over-analytical obsessives in tattered, earthtone clothes, our confidence or insecurity dependent on the obscurity of our record collections. We sigh in disdain at the revelers across the chasm, whose pink hair, studded belts and denim signify clueless victimization at the hands of made-up TRL rebels and one-word \"garage\" bands. Weve been eyeing each other with suspicion and contempt for years, but taking stock of the current situation, it seems that, for their uncritical record collections, the Manic Panic pagans are having a lot more fun than the sheepish, socially retarded \"aesthetes\" around me.\nThough Im probably too old to party with the opposition, Im lately having more fun observing their exuberance than enduring the paranoid stares of a thousand overcautious pretenders to the taste-making throne. Id been looking for a way out of here for months when I caught the daring stare of an obnoxious 21 year-old siren with-- naturally-- a Neurosis patch stitched to her bike bag. She led me away from the shit-talking, permanently dissatisfied masses, her fluorescent jelly bracelets my beacon in pitch black, until, rounding a sharp corner, the flaming pyres of a mile-long overpass lit up the night sky. I crossed this burning bridge last weekend, and learned I have Seattles Blood Brothers to thank for completing this monumental span, which Refused broke ground on some years back.\nThe Blood Brothers early singles and full-length debut, This Adultery Is Ripe, barely rose above forced, overeager screamo; they had moments, but were very late to a game played best by Rorschach and Born Against. As with their recent tourmates Milemarker, however, The Blood Brothers grew in leaps and bounds, offering hugely improved compositions and a more authentic mania on their second LP, 2002s March On, Electric Children! They made the bold and/or questionable decision to sample Nine Inch Nails \"Perfect Drug\" on \"Kiss of the Octopus\", then closed the album with an exasperated solo piano version of \"American Vultures\". Dramatic gear shifts like this are a dangerous dare: you either drop your transmission or leave the competition in the dust. Id lost sight of The Blood Brothers since March On, and didnt know if theyd pulled ahead or fallen behind. As soon as I caught Burn, Piano Island, Burn in the rearview, I took my foot off the gas in defeated awe. Theyve lapped me.\nDrowningman recently flipped the switch on hardcore with their mathematical fury, but The Blood Brothers take things even farther, stripping away the violence and meathead confrontation, setting grindcores high-pitched wailing and tempo freakouts against deliberate, menacing vocals informed by Ian Svenonius and, in places, The Thes Matt Johnson. Milemarkers Satanic Verses (which I savaged for its inconsistency) obviously drew something from The Blood Brothers approach, but Burn, Piano Island, Burn (recorded by Ross Robinson) is frighteningly more slick in production, promotion, technique and import. Yet its full of so much substance that its composite opposition-- heady art vs. commercial appeal-- is almost self-negating. This record is impossible.\nAfter their half-minute statement of intent (\"Guitarmy\"), \"Fuckings Greatest Hits\" borrows a funk-era Stevie Wonder guitar riff that, incredibly, winds around a trademark Jesus Lizard bassline. The songs bloodthirsty chorus never lets up, flailing wildly out of the gates. While the albums title track begins in even more overtly reptilian territory (borrowing from \"Killer McHann\"), its also more controlled than its spastic predecessor, slowing things down to a follow-along pace, and showcasing the almost feminine, metallic squeal that dominates the record and draws Korn and Melt-Banana fans in equal number. The central choruses of \"Burn, Piano Island, Burn\" are among the catchiest moments on the record, offering pagan incantations from a surreal cut-and-paste evisceration of society, but these messages are hidden in the records lyric sheet, all but indecipherable on tape. \"I buried my bride of eight-inch fingers deep in the hungry quicksand/ I buried our child of pineapple skin where the generic sunsets sparkle so bland.\"\nThe lead single \"Ambulance vs. Ambulance\" is heavily evocative of The The, running like \"Infected\" or \"Jealous of Youth\" at 45 RPM in its calmer moments, but the smooth, speedy verse is shattered by a stabbing pre-chorus attack, teasing before the song launches into a four-chord bullet train refrain. For its simplicity, the chorus is welcome reprieve from the murderous shrieking and stop/start chaos that can make this album completely overwhelming on a straight listen. The breakdown is indicative of sinister intent, one of few moments youll decipher without text aides: \"Youll never see your wife and children again/ So tell us what was going through your head/ When you looked into their eyes and said/ \"No thanks, Ill take the hooker instead.\"\nThe swaying reggae tempos behind \"Every Breath Is a Bomb\" are an unfortunate low-light on this otherwise superb album-- think No Doubt on bad acid-- but beyond that ill-advised trip, the problem with Burn, Piano Island, Burn is the very one they set out to attack. Its hard to take hardcore anywhere new. Of the three major breaks with expectation, two fail, and in addition to the melting image of Gwen Stefani Im stuck with, \"God Bless You, Blood Thirsty Zeppelins!\" conjures Marilyn Manson-ian melodrama in its second half, where overdone zombie choruses preface chugging, straight-ahead radio rock.\nIn contrast, The Blood Brothers third break with form is stunning and completely unexpected. \"The Shame\" stomps a sedated march, a sincere ballad that arises in a perfect dawn chorus for the lecherous all-nighter in their wake, shamefully admitting, \"Everything is going to be just awful when were around.\" The reverse-guitar ache and mounting snare rolls are unnecessarily interrupted, however, as a minute or so of the by now too familiar screamo explosions come crashing down. \"The Shame\" would have made a better straight finale without the regression; that the song cuts off in midstream is enough of a middle finger to convention.\nBurn, Piano Island, Burn balances so perfectly between commercial appeal and untainted creativity that its as if the band have been digitally inserted atop a mountain no man can conceivably climb. Like their cutup artwork, The Blood Brothers offer an incongruous marriage of humor, hate and heresy, proving themselves a dedicated collective of disparate brilliance. Burn, Piano Island, Burn devours illusion, and unites clashing factions by reducing them to powerless spectators: The pretentious and the preening look pretty much the same with their jaws on the floor.\n ",

        "article_text": "Just over seven years ago, a friend of mine found a detached deers hoof (and nothing else) by the roadside on the way to high school. Being an idiot completely unaware of the hazards associated with handling dead animal flesh, he figured itd be a great idea to pick it up and bring it along for a day of higher education. Unfortunately-- as Ive been trying to tell Ryan, who sent me this record to review immediately upon hearing that I had this story-- no zany antics ever ensued. A little absurdity in the midst of an otherwise average day, thats it. Some people asked stuff like, \"Why the hell do you have a deer hoof?\" and, \"Would you mind getting your deer leg out of my fucking lunch?\" but basically nothing happened. Still, it left an impression; harmless, real-life surrealism like watching your principal confiscate a severed leg is rarely forgotten.\nThough this story might seem only tangentially related, the moral is simple: Everyone needs an occasional jolt of twisted, rhapsodic hysteria to shatter the mundanity of everyday life once in a while, something to pull them out of the banal mire of geriatrics in alien glasses, tech schools, gas prices, and trips to the supermarket. Deerhoof, bless em, have been serving the public interest for five full albums now by playing host to these little reality-warping junkets. With each successive release, their pop acumen becomes keener, a deadly undercurrent of subversive, sugar-glazed hooks to match their ferocious blasts of noise. Apple O is the latest head-trip from these San Fran bliss addicts, debuting as-yet unseen levels of songcraft; in just thirty minutes, I danced, I wept, I sang-- even the pandas they promised showed up. In short, Apple O performed exactly as expected, although that in itself is a little frightening.\nWhile last years Reveille was a similarly beautiful, bright flight, it was just unhinged enough so that, until its final moments, there was a lingering uncertainty as to its destination: It would either land in a frenetic pop playground, or allow unbridled blasts of noise to plunge it into the sea. Now it seems as though Deerhoof have transmuted Reveilles spurts of genius into a more cohesive, but slightly less astonishing consistency. Apple O is still a fascinating trip, but from the very beginning, its a fairly safe bet that youll be headed somewhere very pretty, without as much worrisome turbulence. Thats not a lock, naturally-- the trademark madness thats infected their earlier recordings hasnt vanished, just diminished-- but this is their most straightforward release to date.\nThe good news is that the bands efforts to \"normalize\" (if such a word can truly be used to describe their work) has reaped great dividends. Every song they present is a staggering collage of guitars and drums, bells, tambourines, brass, and every other manner of beep or squeak under the sun, all falling in line in lush, swaying arrangements. Now, with the added ballast of an improved song-focus, Deerhoof venture into deeper waters, adapting their instrumental melange to a wider variety of styles. Dance, jazz, be-bop, 50s doo-wop, and standard jangle-pop all get thrown into the mix at varying points, while remaining inimitably in the thrall of their particular brand of noise. All thats left is for Satomi Matsuzakis kindergarten-cute vocals to add the final, unifying glaze.\nAs a treatise on love, romance and creation through a very cracked looking glass-- love as bridge (the card game), among other metaphors-- Apple O functions loosely as a concept album, so its tighter cohesion might be expected. Staccato crunch and trembling lines accompany the beautiful romance of \"LAmour Stories\"; \"Dummy Discards a Heart\" reprises the blistering, start/stop dynamics and killer percussion that made \"This Magnificent Bird Will Rise\" such a highlight of Reveille. From the streetcorner serenade of \"Dinner for Two\"-- a sort of J-Pop reincarnation of \"Earth Angel\"-- to the solemn regret of \"Apple Bomb\", all avenues of this relatively tranquil concept are explored. And then, in a definitive, almost symbolic closing statement, Deerhoof opt for a humble, unadorned acoustic gem (\"Blue Cash\") in the vein of those prep-schoolers in Belle \u0026 Sebastian, rather than any of their signature weirdness. As Matsuzaki sings, \"Play on your heartstrings a song,\" its innocence perfectly conveys everything theyve spent this entire record trying to say.\nOnce again, Deerhoof have released an album masquerading as out-of-the-blue insanity, while cleverly harboring nothing but the most basic, virally contagious pop around. Apple O never seems quite so unpredictable as Reveille, so its a safe bet that if you liked Reveille but found it a bit too experimental, youll like this one better. Of course, in the age-old controversy between a steady keel of greatness or sporadic moments of true genius, genius has to take the gold, but this albums intense variety and sparklingly consistent pop songwriting make a great consolation prize.",

        "article_text": "Charity albums all start wonderfully-- with good intentions and noble causes. Alas, they frequently end poorly, entering the world as collections of outtakes, abandoned ideas, and uninspired covers. Whether that matters is another thing: If you share Natalie Portmans interest in the value of microcredit, or any number of executive producers hope for more Darfur awareness or money for Doctors Without Borders, getting a decent Death Cab song or Afrobeat comp should simply be a bonus \"thank you\" for your minimal contribution.\nFor 20 years, the Red Hot Organization has been-- along with War Child, more on them in the upcoming days-- the gold standard for the charity album. Battling HIV and AIDS via pop culture, Red Hot came out of the gate with an eclectic winner, the Cole Porter covers record Red Hot + Blue (1990). Most of our readers are likely more familiar with their 1993 No Alternative disc, which collected tracks from Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Pavement, and others. Two decades later, they follow with Dark Was the Night, a collection of 31 new and exclusive songs from most of the heavy hitters of the NPR-friendly wing of indie music.\nProduced by Red Hot, along with the Nationals Bryce and Aaron Dessner, the vast majority of the songs on this collection are worth owning regardless of where the money is going. The first of the two CDs, in particular, is full of gems. David Byrne and Dirty Projectors keep their vocal affectations on the right side of awesome on \"Knotty Pine\"; Feist adeptly teams with Death Cabs Ben Gibbard on a cover of Vashti Bunyans \"Train Song\" and later slow burns through the outstanding Grizzly Bear collaboration \"Service Bell\"; and both Yeasayers nimble \"Tightrope\" and My Brightest Diamonds smoky version of \"Feeling Good\" are eyebrow-raising lateral moves.\nA few things that looked a bit too on-the-nose on paper turn out to work: Bon Iver, in the process of breaking away from the lazy \"guy in a Wisconsin cabin\" narrative, delivers a song about... a small town in Wisconsin; the Books, a half-cello, half-electronics duo, and José González, a Nick Drake-like singer-songwriter still best known for his covers, get together to do Nick Drakes \"Cello Song\"; Kronos Quartet boldly transform Blind Willie Johnsons gut-wrenching, crucifixion-inspired 1927 blues moan \"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\" (the track that gives the comp its name) into a chamber ensemble piece.\nNot to be outdone by their invitees, the National shout-out Pavement on the languid \"So Far Around the Bend\", recalling Pavement doing the same to one of their favorite bands (R.E.M.) on No Alternative. Aaron Dessner pairs with Bon Iver for one of the records several ghostly tracks, \"Big Red Machine\", while brother Bryce goes one better, teaming with Antony Hegarty to cover Bob Dylans take of the traditional ballad \"I Was Young When I Left Home\". Antony in particular shines, giving it a somber matter-of-fact reading that lends the entire song, not just the purgatory of its final verse, a note of tragedy.\nDisc One saves its best for last though: Sufjan Stevens breaks his relative silence with a cover of the Castanets \"You Are the Blood\", scrapping his baroque preciousness for tactile avant-pop. Infusing the track with a twitchy, restless quality, Stevens re-imagines the song-- musically as well as lyrically-- as a tussle between the subject and his body, an appropriately haunting quality for this compilation. (Buck 65s remix, \"Blood Pt. 2\", isnt as successful.) Stevens teams a more cacophonous version of his traditional arsenal of horns and choral vocals with the sort of minimalist electronics he leaned more heavily on in the days before he earned indie-level fame.\nDisc Two is more of a mixed bag. Spoon kick it off with a badly needed injection of rhythm; their \"Well-Alright\" feels like the jaunty bar-bandisms that used to soundtrack National Lampoon films-- think \"Im Alright\" or \"Holiday Road\". Arcade Fire follow with a similar but less-interesting version of the same idea. From there things oscillate between meh and engaging, with quality contributions from the New Pornographers (covering one of their bandmate Dan Bejars Destroyer songs), Yo La Tengo, Riceboy Sleeps (featuring members of Sigur Rós), and Conor Oberst with Gillian Welch.\nStanding out even more positively, My Morning Jackets laid-back \"El Caporal\" and Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings swivel-hipped Shuggie Otis cover \"Inspiration Information\" bring warmth to the proceedings; Belle and Sebastians Stuart Murdoch-- one of the few non-North Americans here-- adds lyrics to an old Scottish folk song, and the resulting \"Another Saturday\" is one more quiet triumph for him in a career full of them. Best in class on this disc, however, goes to TV on the Radios Dave Sitek, whose version of the Troggs \"With a Girl Like You\" is like a Stephin Merritt pastiche with horns grafted onto it, but its glorious because of, rather than despite, its obvious homage.\nI confess though: My first reaction to listening to this all the way through was negative. When focusing on whats not here rather than what is, Dark Was the Night comes off as a gray, monotone look at the current indie landscape and, as a result, works best in small batches. Its missing not only rhythm and electronics-- more hip-hop, anything in the DFA axis, M.I.A., Animal Collective, etc.-- but volume and velocity as well. Sure, its a charity record not a party soundtrack, but No Alternative was full of actual rock songs. On this evidence, todays guitar-based indie is primarily folkie tunefulness, baroque lines in which the guitar is subservient to other instruments, or, based on the original Simon Reynolds definition of the word, post-rock: \"Using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords.\"\nDissecting the reasons for this and determining the consequences, if any, is another matter altogether, but its a shame that the diversity of previously successful charity comps-- the Red Hot ones mentioned, War Childs The Help Album-- is missing here. Naturally these artists are more popular than their experimental, electronic, and rock brethren-- Gang Gang Dance, Air France, or No Age would sell fewer records than the Decemberists on any day of the week-- but the idea that rock is less central than folk music in underground North American music is not only really weird but a very new phenomenon. Again though, these songs are uniformally excellent, so its a minor and possibly misplaced quibble. And, who knows, maybe-- hopefully!-- Red Hot is in the process of asking the Hold Steady or Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Hot Chip or the Knife, to help craft sequels.",

        "article_text": "Forty years into his recording career, Scott Walker is still making music that he wants to make; like all great artists, hes making music that only he can make-- and hoping (or not) that other people catch onto something, anything in the big, dark, dense vacuum of The Drift. Walker beats the noise-mongers in New York, the conservatory-schooled theater kids, the gallery poseurs, the reclusive art-pop geniuses, all the perennially stylish genre tourists, celebrity revolutionaries, and outmoded underground icons. He, despite little more than a cult status in his native (and long since abandoned) country, has emerged a visionary, maker of some of the most texturally complex, viscerally emotional, and downright horrific music this side of anyone at all.\nBut then, the composer of The Drift, Walkers first new studio record since 1995s devastating Tilt, didnt appear from out of nowhere. Rather, the Ohio-born artist (born Scott Noel Engel) staked a claim to the musical territory somewhere between orchestral pop and psychological soliloquy from his earliest solo records. After garnering major success in the UK as one-third of the pop act the Walker Brothers (none of whom were actually related, or born with the name Walker), Scott Walker left the group and released four LPs between 1967 to 1969 (Scott, 2, 3, and 4), each of which is held as a classic by diehard pop sophisticates. The earliest of these records were also successful in the UK, though as Walkers themes became weightier (influenced not only by Belgian singer/composer Jacques Brel, but the dark end of art-house cinema and literature), his audience slowly dwindled. Walker released a string of albums in the early 1970s that retreated drastically from the ambition of his first four before unexpectedly reuniting with the Walker Brothers for 1978s Nite Flights, and unveiling the first glimpses of the major musical artist we hear today.\nWalkers Climate of Hunter from 1984 furthered his movement towards the abstract (albeit very gradually), though it wasnt until Tilt that his gift for radical songcraft and sound sculpting came to the fore. If his earliest solo music contained unusual themes for a pop artist, they did at least contain fairly conventional orchestrations and melodies. Tilt threw all that out in favor of a hybrid mixture of modern classical music, found sound, dissonant avant-rock, and hyper-personal vocal expression. It was a masterpiece, even as it alienated fans hoping for a return to comparatively calm waters.\nThe Drift is still further down an unbeaten path. Written and produced over a seven-year period, this record, like a painstakingly fine Ingmar Bergman film, moves slowly and deliberately, with an intense focus and refusal to turn away from disturbing \"images.\" Like Tilt, its stories are taken from a varied, almost overstuffed horizon of literature, news stories, Walkers half-forgotten dreams, and otherwise poetic neuroses. Speaking visually, the music is mostly darker hues, though sudden flashes of blue light or explosive white beams punctuate an otherwise intimidating monolithic landscape. Walker describes working with \"blocks of sound\" as opposed to written arrangements, and the record betrays a broad, almost brawny movement, as if being slowly, persistently kicked in the gut by the characters (or characterizations) of the composers songs.\nLyrically, The Drift (like its predecessor) practically invites volumes of analysis, especially after repeated listens-- but then, the best part about them is that they arent usually explicit. \"Cossacks Are\", with pulled quotes like, \"A moving aria for a vanishing style of mind\" or \"A nocturne filled with glorious ideas\" could very well refer to Walkers own music, or even poke fun at his reviews. Its hard to say for sure, but impossible to resist looking for clues.\nThroughout the album, textures change without a moments notice: The solemn organ and drum pulse of \"Clara\" leads like a brick to the head into the wallop of sticks on animal flesh and churning, nauseating strings, only to shed its skin into muffled-scream violins, and back again. Walker sings about a body \"dipped in blood in the moonlight/ Like what happen in America,\" and later describes a vision of the songs namesake (\"Sometimes I feel like a swallow/ A swallow which by some mistake has gotten into an attic and knocks its head against the walls in terror\"). The images fly by as they would in a nightmare, and the music is no less surreal or paranoid. \"Cue\" looks at the parasitic life of a virus, proceeding like a Stanley Kubrick movie, free of any particular morality or obligation to end happily, and full of exquisite imagery, as considered as it is obscene.\n\"Jesse\" begins with the hum of jet engines and a mutilated take on Elvis Presleys \"Jailhouse Rock\" guitar riff. Walker has described this as his \"9/11 song,\" and uses the motif of Elvis and his stillborn twin brother to make a statement about American mythology and hubris-- and yes, thats pretentious, as is most of Walkers output for the last 30 years. It also reminds that \"pretension\" isnt always synonymous with \"bullshit\": Walker earns every one of his conceptual pretexts via the iron-fist dynamics of the songs, and his own deep, wet baritone, deepening the scope of every measure it inhabits. Sometimes, his words seem secondary, as on the explosive noise rock intro to \"Hand Me Ups\", which sounds akin to legendary experimental Japanese band Ground Zero (check the bass sax!), or the pounding, jittery middle section on \"Psoriatic\". Elsewhere, Walkers voice is held afloat and given center stage by the gentlest accompaniment, as on the subtly wry album closer, \"A Lover Loves\". If you dont think the guy has a sense of humor, check the \"psst-psst-pssts\" between every verse.\nThere will doubtlessly be many listeners who dont understand how anyone could listen to such relentlessly \"bleak\" music, but Walker is the kind of artist that exposes a lot of would-be art as background entertainment-- and like a great artist, he doesnt actually make a value judgment out of it; he merely goes on about his work, distancing himself from the fleshy pile of pastimes and people who would obscure the most ambitious functions of art. Walker inspires, scares, confuses, provokes-- not because he wants to manipulate you, but because hes an interesting person whos worked a long time trying to make interesting music. Even at its most dissonant and abstract, this record is human to the core, and if youre ready to face a few demons, its as inspiring as music gets.\n ",

        "article_text": "Growing up in the shadow of Mt. Erie, the lone peak stretching above Phil Elvrums hometown of Fidalgo Island, Washington, it was probably easy to imagine it as the highest point in the world, the place where Earth met sky. Mt. Erie is a mere 1,448 ft. at its peak, barely a foothill to Everest, and yet to a child, its summit is stupefying. But in the end, the weight of years pierces the exaggerated perception of youth; theres often a cruel disparity between the remnants of distorted childhood imagery and the onset of adulthood. I dont know what, if anything, a young Elvrum might have imagined in Eries wilderness, but Im guessing those memories cast a long shadow.\nAfter his three prior Microphones releases turned out, quite subconsciously, to be about Air, Water, and Fire-- respectively and chronologically-- Mount Eerie is, in Elvrums words, an album \"more consciously about mountains and earth, though it turned out to be more about space.\" Its nominal peak is naturally at its heart, but only as a caricature plucked from the mind of an over-imaginative young poet, twisted and ominously stretching upward as a bridge to the heavens. Above and below, the albums drama is unveiled as a five-act play in words and music, profound and surreal, made all the more so with its awesome, childlike simplicity. Its a grim myth of revelation, death, and rebirth, but written in crayon, ensuring with its bright colors that all will work out in the end.\nEach track serves as a piece in Mount Eeries continuous, linear story, and many of Elvrums friends assume roles as the primary cast of characters: Kyle Field (of Little Wings) is Death; Karl Blau represents the birds that pick apart Elvrums body, and K founder Calvin Johnson gives voice to The Universe itself. Mirah Zeitlyn, Khaela Maricich, Adam Forkner, and Anna Oxygen also make appearances. Its ambitious to say the least, but the contributors are up to the task, executing these whimsically bizarre roles with remarkable sincerity. Music is too often described as \"cinematic,\" but Mount Eerie evokes that exact quality; its almost possible to envision the sets-- a handcrafted, celestial night sky, a sparse, faux-knoll for Eeries grassy zenith-- and though crude, theyre careful and cared for. The stark sincerity of the performance lends it all a gorgeous, unrefined artistry.\nThe story begins with \"The Sun\", where the influence of classical form on this album is immediately apparent; beyond the traditional five-act arc, the music is allegorical. Like Verdi attempting to summon spring with a violin, Elvrum tackles things that are much, much larger than a simple tom, snare, or human voice. \"The Sun\" opens with the heart-like pulse that concluded The Glow, Pt. 2, gradually and subtly mutating to a more complex rhythm. Soon, a wash of drums fades across the channels, evoking either the rising and setting of our star, or the revolution of Earth. It builds to climax before Elvrum, in touching a capella, relates the story of his birth, whereupon he sights Death on a black ship and flees for the peak of Mt. Eerie. At 17 minutes, the track finally supernovas with a deafening drone and crash of cymbals, before the story advances.\nAs he scales the mountainside to a delicate acoustic strum, Elvrum \"reminisces about a girl gracefully juggling [him as] a planet,\" and somewhere, distantly, she thinks of him. But as he climbs, day is fading: creepy tympani patterns call forth our timeless fear of night, and a Greek chorus gives voice to these feelings of isolation and worry. Its the voice of the cosmos, staring down at Phil, alone on the mountain peak. The hazy-sweet hum of the night sky is at once reassuring, beautiful, and disturbing, but it all gives way as he glimpses his Death approaching, and resigns himself to his fate: \"Soon a big black cloud will come/ Soon a big black cloud will come/ And press you to the ground/ The air will leave your chest/ And youll fade from where youre found.\"\nThe clarity of his apprehension is breathtaking, voiced by those whove shaped the story up to the moment before Death arrives with its primal, percussive bloodlust. Phil dies, and carrion birds leave the peak \"empty and windy again.\" After the cawing, and the hiss of wind has subsided, a second mountain reveals itself, stretching further up into \"The Universe\"; what once seemed infinite and unknowable to mortal perception-- as abstract as a flat plane of light and darkness-- now deepens into a vast, definite expanse. \"But Universe, I see your face/ Looks just like mine/ And we are open wide,\" Phil sings into space, which echoes his words back to him with a ghostly chorus. A titanic bass drum bellows in the distant reaches, and after his life and death, Phil finds his resting place, at home in the arms of the Universe.\nI gave away the ending, but this epic is no mystery; the portents are clear from the beginning, and the listeners job is to take it all in. Excepting the heart-wrenching sight of Death in its title track, Mount Eerie never quite achieves the transcendent, lo-fi glory of The Glow, Pt. 2, but its no less incredible a spectacle. This is a massive artistic statement from The Microphones, and though it may be cryptic-- even overwhelming at times-- it remains warm and open, thanks to the stunning intimacy that has consistently been the groups hallmark. As the truth and meaning of the universe become manifest, Mount Eerie comforts, illustrating that comprehension isnt as important as acceptance.",

We valiantly try to communicate and create shared understanding, to define and relate, to create certainty in the world around us, all through the use of language, but in the end, if my idea of chair isnt exactly the same as your idea of a chair (which its not), then whats the point? Sometimes it seems like language causes as many problems as it solves, and maybe wed all be better off shutting up and looking for a better method. In that case, its like my mom always said: \"If you dont have anything nice to say, release a staggering debut CD of wordless, transportive beauty.\" I never put much stock in it, but Out Hud certainly paid attention, and here comes S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D., their answer to the brains imperfect linguistic domineering. Out Hud can express more in one elegant passage than a weeks worth of Derrida, and all without saying a word.\nOkay, fine-- Out Hud versus the human brain? Clearly, thats going a bit far, but S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. is similarly difficult to dissect. Although its darkly evocative compositions are filled with unspoken imagery and emotion, and each track feels like so much more than the sum of its instruments, Out Hud cant be so easily reduced to a simple genre classifier. What sets them apart is the populist edge of these heady tracks; their overtly cerebral complexity is perfectly suffused with dynamic, vibrant rhythm. Frequently, music that traffics in composition as complex as Out Huds is so dense or rigid as to be entirely indecipherable, suited more toward turtlenecked discussion and heavy-duty beard-stroking than any sort of visceral enjoyment. Instead of simply confounding its listeners, however, Out Hud enfolds them deep within its vast sonic spaces, thanks largely to a potent assortment of industrial-strength dub beats and neo-disco laid down alternately by Tyler Popes drum programming and actual drummer Phyllis Forbes. Out Huds sprawling works short-circuit traditional neural pathways, wire the brain directly to the feet, and actively stimulate both.\nEven the most inert among you should be compelled to move when confronted with such an irresistible force. Fluid tempo changes create a true sense of drama within a few short minutes; tracks rise and fall, build and collapse. Call it a fusion of the practical and the fanciful; intellectual depth combined with instant accessibility. The effect is dizzying, but totally inviting, and before you realize it, the virulent drum patterns and percussive effects have taken their toll. The once-elusive arrangements that might have remained forever out of reach now surround you.\nBut these guys are just getting warmed up; a tangle of tonic moods and atmospheres carries you down familiar, but implacable, rain-slicked streets. You sit in on late-night dealings and seamy, emotional back-room confessions. Long, low drones create a palpable sense of tension behind it all, and distant echoes hint at danger just out of sight, but an optimistic guitar refrain indicates that there may be light at the end of tunnel after all. Whole albums often fail to deliver music this poetic, and Out Hud manages it all in a single track, the aptly named \"The Story of the Whole Thing\". Out Hud excel at creating atmospheres, allowing the listener to read into the music, and its this subtle ambiguity of intention that makes S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.s mystique so intriguing. For forty minutes, this band weaves together a mystifying array of audio noir; theres an almost imperceptible threat to the music, but time and again, it proves too compelling to turn away from.\nOut Hud also back up their flash with remarkable substance, setting their music apart from anything as one-dimensional as standard club offerings or moody trance cuts. In many ways, S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. can stand toe to toe with some of the best of the IDM genre, which is no mean feat for music so heavily rooted in organic sounds. Of course, the drumming has a lot to do with that, but no more so than the bands other instrumentation. Nic Offers bass seamlessly syncs with the beat to form a slow, soulful underpinning on these songs, and Tyler Pope wrings every manner of noise out of his six strings. In particular, the guitar theatrics are jaw-dropping; it echoes across the channels in time with the rhythm while simultaneously shattering the calm with a jangling blast of noise on \"Dad, Theres a Little Phrase Called Too Much Information\", as just one example of Popes invention. Offer runs his keyboard through every possible role, from driving the melody to vicious crescendos of noise, and along with Molly Schnicks versatile cello as a percussive and melodic force, its hard to imagine fully exploring the near-unfathomable reaches of Out Huds tunes.\nAfter a handful of vinyl-only releases, Out Huds first CD made me briefly reconsider the merits of the vinyl medium, if only as a means of obtaining their other works. Fortunately, theres enough material here to keep me busy with Out Hud for a long time. Of course, attempting to describe the effect with words is a little silly, but the albums strong enough that I had to try. Youre better off just listening.",

        "article_text": "Smith Westerns have cleaned up nicely. Just over a year ago, the Chicago foursome were of the strictly \"lo-fi\" persuasion, stirring up hot, filthy garage-rock candy out of Marc Bolan and Beatles signifiers. It was youthful music in feeling and sound-- their noisy full-length debut was recorded while they were still in high school-- but the remarkable hooks buried therein were clear enough to land them on the increasingly stacked Fat Possum roster. And suddenly, they had a studio budget the likes of which they definitely hadnt enjoyed before. Though the leap is audibly huge, Dye It Blondes many successes arent wholly the result of its gilded production values and ambition. This band was able to furnish first-class melodies from the beginning. Now theyve grown along with their resources.\nYou can hear the progress right away in \"Imagine, Pt. 3\", a song originally released as part of a split 7\" in April 2010. Sped up here just a touch, its also been re-outfitted with a far creamier set of synths and guitars. The way the latter seem to clasp hands during the coda is particularly breathtaking, frontman Cullen Omori and guitarist Max Kakacek letting their individual lines mate rather than duel. While the melodic foundation was already sturdy throughout, here, what once sounded ragged in stretches is now plush-upholstered from start to finish. Every single piece of Dye It Blonde is similarly decadent, whether its the sweet whine of semi-titular closer \"Dye the World\" or the twilight jangle of \"End of the Night\".\nIn an interview not long after the albums completion, Omori noted that this otherwise new set of songs was influenced by 90s Britpop luminaries like Oasis, Teenage Fanclub, and Suede. All are present sonically and spiritually, be it in brash tones, melodic IQ or the sheer scope of these recordings. Where a Smith Westerns hook may have once sounded like another fuzzy member of the Nuggets family/genus, it now unfolds like crane-shot, mainstage festival fare. \"Still New\" for example floats some phasered guitar interplay before Kakacek rips a hole across the chest of the song with a woozy line so big it essentially serves as a chorus. Like \"Weekend\", whose central, hair-flipping lick also hugs all its parts together perfectly, the song just sounds so drunk-- drunk on love, drunk on heavy petting, drunk on drink, or maybe just drunk on a some combination of the above. In song, it all depends on the lean of Omoris voice and the whip of his chord changes, the curves of his brother Camerons bass lines.\nThat moony/beery-eyed feel bleeds through every corridor of this album and in turn forms a crystalline expression of what moves this band. Their use of the studio in augmenting that never goes overboard, though: this music still retains the innately psychedelic, lamplit, tongue-kissed sense of atmosphere that set it apart. Theres perhaps no better instance of all that than \"All Die Young\", the albums centerpiece. Its a ballad turned hymn whose grand, tumbling scale and \"Oh Yoko\"-indebted outro celebration are peaks on an album rich in them. In its closing moments, Omori sings what sounds like, \"Love is lovely when you are young.\" They were convincing before, but now they seem like experts.",

        "article_text": "The best travel writers skew their journeys into pointed narratives, writing the story of the landscape by seizing all the weird, awkward bits that make it distinct. On first listen, Sufjan Stevens latest installment of state-based chamber-folk, Illinois, sounds dangerously similar to 2003s Michigan, all chirping vocals and copious orchestration. Both records inadvertently validate East Coast stereotypes of tough Midwestern values: This is earnest, hard-working music, morally rooted and technically precise.\nStill, Stevens has always been a folk singer more in theory than in practice. He routinely ditches folks scrappy, stripped-down aesthetics, but consistently embraces its stories-of-the-people unanimity. Consequently, Illinois is less about place than spirit. Stevens dutifully celebrates and indicts all the appropriate landmarks, isolating the highest and lowest points in Illinois history, but at its best, the album makes America feel very small and very real: A boy crying in a van, a girl with bone cancer, stepmothers, parades, bandstands, presidents, UFOs, cream of wheat, trains after dark, a serial killer, Bible study.\nMusically, Illinois is strange and lush, as excessive and challenging as its giant, gushing song titles. Despite employing a small army of backers (including a string quartet, the Illinoisemaker Choir, drummer James McAllister, trumpeter Craig Montoro, and a pile of extra vocalists), Stevens is more forefronted than on the comparably solo Seven Swans. Manning nearly every instrument in his arsenal (and some beyond-- Stevens recorded the piano parts at St. Pauls Episcopal Church in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn), Stevens conducts his friends with impressive grace. Stevens pipes quiver generously; his vocals could be easily (perhaps accurately) read as precious, but theyre really more intimate than emo, and always beautifully echoed by his backers.\nThe colossal \"The Black Hawk War\" cartwheels slowly into a climax of strings and horns, gurgling and pushing, ostensibly signifying (with much aplomb) the violent return of the Sac and Fox Indians to Illinois. Stevens may be deploying state propaganda, or validating Black Hawks push home, but no matter how grave its reality, the moment still lands like a giant, neon-cased WELCOME TO ILLINOIS billboard. Trumpets blare, submission looms, our eyes widen, it makes sense: Illinois. Is. The. Greatest. State. Of. All. TIME!\nThe excellent \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" (named after an Illinois state holiday honoring the polish-born victor of the Battle of Brandywine) is a heartbreaking story of late winter death, bravely sung over rich banjo; the bubbly \"Decatur\" (the title of which is, awesomely, rhymed with \"alligator,\" \"aviator,\" and \"emancipator\") features one of Stevens most undeniable melodies, the kind of pretty, tinkling cue that sends everyone in earshot twirling through the streets, jazz hands and all. Matthew Morgan yelps solid backing bits (see their gorgeously squeaky harmony on \"Stephen A. Douglass was a great debater/ But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator!\"), while Daniel and Elin Smith (of Brother Danielson, and the Danielson Famile) chime in for a campfire finish, complete with self-applause.\nStevens has a remarkable habit of being rousing and distressing at the same time, prodding disparate emotional centers until its unclear whether its best to grab your party shoes or a box of tissues. The gut-punching \"Chicago\" cagily celebrates the innate (and deeply American) tendency to employ highways as escape routes, ditching old mistakes for new swatches of land, new plates of eggs, new parking lots. Impossibly propulsive, each calm, harmonized, Illinoisemaker cry of \"All things go!\" pushes harder, promising liberation, by death or by automobile: \"If I was crying/ In the van with my friend/ It was for freedom/ From myself and from the land,\" Stevens chokes, voice shaking over a haze of drums, strings, and shimmering keyboards.\n\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" traces, with alarming accuracy, and over a hazy swirl of acoustic guitar and piano, the pathology of Illinois most infamous serial killer: From 1972 until his arrest in 1978, Gacy was responsible for the torture, rape, and murder of 33 boys and young men, many of whom were discovered buried under the floorboards of his Norwood Park home. Lyrically, Stevens nails the specifics (as a kid, Gacy was slammed in the head by a swing, resulting in a blackout-inducing blood clot in his brain; he routinely donned a clown suit to entertain at a local hospital; victims were typically immobilized with chloroform-soaked cloths), and shifts perspectives gracefully; anchored in first-person, the songs narrator prods Gacys mother and father, his neighbors, his victims, himself. More than any other track here, \"Gacy\" highlights Stevens literary prowess, perfectly packed with nuance and detail.\nAt seventy-four minutes, Illinois is an exercise in patience; considering how long it takes to dog paddle through all the gooey orchestration, chugging through Stevens meticulous arrangements and parsing out the melodies, Illinois is a bit of a commitment. Its 21 tracks consist of a handful of transitional snippets (many arresting in their own right), and plenty of good stuff (\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulder\", in particular) is buried way in the back, rewarding those who persevere, and in both theory and execution, Illinois is huge, a staggering collection of impeccably arranged American tribute songs.",

        "article_text": "Cocoa puffs, meh. The better story is rocks 50-year failure to make plain its furious soundmaker, the electric guitar. Sound is vibration, pure tone is farce, distortion is social, inevitable. No surprise, my faves whove struggled with that pop vs. noise, structure vs. unstructure windigo-- Branca, Hendrix, Velvets, Can, Sonic Youth, JAMC, MBV, Fennesz-- count for some of modern musics all-time greatest failures. Heres another one.\nNorways Serena Maneesh take the main stage at Oslos Øya Music Festival dressed like gypsies. Band leader Emil Nikolaisen has a wispy moustache, Chick Corea-style, Jimi-worshipping. His half-sister on bass could ring for Nico, a cold, daunting figure from afar, no stage movements, noble and grand, somewhat melancholic. The other members I cant see. \"What a fucking mission this bands on,\" I think. \"What a terrible fucking band.\"\nThey tinker on stage with a hint of motorik for 20 minutes, then a stomp of it, no sign of stopping; people have no stomach for this diskaholic bullshit, and tuck out for chicken and beer and, I think, Roots Manuva. No cue, no looks, Nico snaps a bassline from the stew of guitar noise and disembodied voices, and suddenly Serena Maneesh are bars into the festivals first and only mindfuck-- the one I went several thousand miles hoping I might experience. Tucked deep within \"Sapphire Eyes High\" is the only melody that matters this fall, its chorus unintelligible because Nicos voice dissipates upon exit-- so too do the stringy jangle and generously amped kick. The breathy line goes for but 30 seconds, entirely too short, then dissolves back into the abstractions that birthed it. So much noise it takes to balance out so beautiful a moment.\nThey get it, Serena Maneesh, their demeanor electric and alternating, built off antagonistic relationships. The band, like the instrument, are apt to prove noise and un-noise are of one cut. To that end, these arent 11 songs so much as 12 blood-riling arguments. \"Un-Deux\" jumps forth and back from sunshine pop to pork-pulled guitar noise, a clean but 30-mile-wide gap between the two, more impassible with each repetition. Two minutes, they give up. \"Dont Come Down Here\" takes a ho-hum strum and hopes that the one fissure in the progression-- a sloppy passing chord that butts with whats before and after it-- will, with enough repetitions, spiderweb and eat away the pleasantness. Nope. \"Chorale Lick\" and \"Candlelighted\" meander half their lengths, soft-focus guitars and brute syncopated grooves with nonsense floating in and about, shrouding melodies too shimmering for bare sight.\nThe album as a whole fights the twelfth, track sequence playing up each songs coaster-like turmoil. A subtle move, but it bleaches the whites, deepens the blacks-- rare chiaroscuro for rocks faint of art. Listen, those fuzzy guitar octaves that start the record could have led us anywhere-- so for-fun, so worry-free-- but instead we follow them into themselves, until this full-length debut implodes with 10 minutes of dizzying, even skronky frustration, then a shriek off the footbridge. Why are the stakes so high? Better question is, why not?",

        "article_text": "Dan Snaiths Caribou project, to borrow a line from another Canadian songwriter, has been a zigzagging journey through the past. He was most entrenched in the present moment on his 2001 debut Start Breaking My Heart, but even that records soft-focus, post-Aphex Twin electronica seemed pulled from two or three years earlier. By 2003s Up in Flames he began glancing at psychedelia, but through a distinctly 1990s lens, mixing the cracked sensibility of Boces-era Mercury Rev with the ecstatic come-together crescendos of big beat. Milk of Human Kindness from 2005 was connected closely to its predecessor, but it added the unblinking rhythms and tidy instrumental efficiency of 70s krautrock. And now, with his latest album Andorra, Snaith finally and fully inhabits the 1960s, specifically the branch of sun-kissed pop that was aware of psychedelia but chose not to abandon the pillow-soft pleasures of AM radio, of the Zombies, Free Design, the Mamas \u0026 Papas, and, of course, the Beach Boys.\nThe significant factor in Snaiths transformation from his instrumental beginnings is his increased confidence as a singer. On Up in Flames, the voice was another sound to be fed into the computer, a way to reference the idea of songs rather than actually sing them. From there, its been an unsteady trajectory pointing toward songwriting proper, and with Andorra, Snaith seems to be paying attention to chords and melodic progression first. He may have even titled a song to commemorate the new development: \"Melody Day\", Andorras first track and lead single, is the most tuneful of the bunch, with Snaiths high tenor sitting squarely in the center of the rolling drums, sleigh bells, flute, and what sound like vintage synths.\n\"Melody Day\" is also significant for being the only track to fully embrace what has become a Caribou trademark: the brief pause at the end of a bar which explodes into an enormous volley of percussion. The album as a whole is a touch more subdued; these \"big\" moments-- which were at risk of becoming a cliché, anyway-- appear sporadically, and generally with less intensity. Instead, in Andorras more song-oriented first half, Snaith creates tracks that startle with their lightness of touch and joyous evocation of honeyed late-60s guitar pop. A half-decade after the Elephant 6 movement first started to fade, Snaiths move can be seen as risky, but it succeeds, oddly enough, in part because of the one-man-band nature of his project. He still works essentially alone, playing and sampling instruments and building tracks with a computer, and his music, with its loops and thick production, retains the markers of his process. Hes also not aiming his music at any sort of radio; the mid-range is jammed full, distortion pops up regularly without apology, and weird sounds appear from nowhere and zoom between the speakers.\nThe sunshine daydream reaches peak intensity five songs in with \"Desiree\", whose very title dates it perfectly: we know from her name that this girl might trip down the streets with the Associations Windy, perhaps looking for kicks or waiting for Mary to come along. Theres barely any percussion to speak of, just swells of synthetic strings, bits of flute, zooming harp runs, and chiming guitar leading to a big chorus thats all Snaiths multi-layered voice. Then theres \"Sandy\" and \"Irene\", also names more likely in 2007 to belong to grandmothers. The former is a Andorras most dynamic track aside from \"Melody Day\", and also has the most interesting vocal arrangement, its highly reverbed streaks of harmony suggesting of a pop-minded church choir. It hints that Snaith might also be taking lyrical inspiration from a earlier time: \"Sometimes in her eyes I see forever/ I cant believe what weve found.\" The words here are not always intelligible-- theres often a lot going on, so theyre easy to miss-- but its safe to say that the music carries the bulk of the emotional meaning.\nAndorra takes an odd detour over its final three songs. \"Sundialing\" returns to the repetitious Neu!-isms of Milk of Human Kindness but dresses up the steady rhythm with Day-Glo swirls. \"Irene\" is a short mid-tempo ballad that is instrumental through its first half, and even then the only sound is essentially a drum machine. The tune in its second half is vague, suggesting a more fleshed-out song sitting somewhere else thats never quite articulated. The eight-minute closer \"Niobe\" builds from bubbling, acidic synths and folds in tightly sequenced, Orb-like pulses, an extended slow-burn that occasionally threatens a big climax with a sampled drum fill but never quite goes there.\nConsidering its length and placement at the end of the record, \"Niobe\" is a tad disappointing, never quite acquiring the momentum its structure would seem to suggest. Still, its also an encouraging sign that Snaith is thinking in these more open-ended terms, thats hes not confining himself to the retro pop explosion that, as he demonstrates here, he has essentially mastered. Andorra will undoubtedly win Caribou a lot of new fans and rightfully so; its a big, bold, tuneful collection that impresses with its ambition and meticulous arrangement. But its also nice to think that Caribous course is not fixed, that the future might hold a few more surprises than whats found here.",

        "article_text": "Given the hundreds of thousands of words hunted and pecked in the service of M.I.A.s 2005 debut Arular, the odds on her delivering more grist for the mill with her followup were probably somewhere between slim and Amy Winehouse. Sure, Arular-- which has quietly sold 130,000 copies in the U.S.-- ultimately didnt seem to make much of an impact on the public at large, but the bountiful texts woven into its rich backstory worked like so much rockcrit catnip; momentarily setting aside the problem of M.I.A.s own hazily defined personal politics, that album had the effect of nudging the critical forum back towards the kinds of issues it doesnt grapple with nearly enough. Issues that feel more important than ever as our traditional notions of genre and geography melt away, namely: How we square our desire for freshness and fun with the ugly politics of cultural tourism, or whether we bother at all; how the internet works like a hall of mirrors on identity and meaning; whether theres really any such thing as an empty visceral gesture.\nIf Arular provided a platform to discuss those things, Kala certainly invites us to continue the conversation. For all the scrutiny and cynicism aimed at her in the past 18 months, M.I.A. hasnt dialed herself down in the slightest. If anything, Kala finds her puffing out her chest and asserting herself more strenuously than ever, half-baked agit-prop and all. When she boasts on the stomping, Bollywood-sampling opener \"Bamboo Banga\" that shes \"coming back with power/ Power,\" you get the sense that by \"power\" she means \"courage of conviction.\" Regardless of how you square with her politics, her willingness to continue the muckracking is admirable, if not dimension-adding. Dont forget, shes rubbing elbows with the likes of Interscope and Timbaland now; for all the choices she might have made and the audiences she might have aimed at, the fresh-sounding, adventurous, and not-exactly-accessible Kala is the kind of record that obviously demanded a defined personal vision. Taken in concert with her understandable blasting of Pitchfork for perpetuating the male-led ingenue myth a few weeks ago, this campaigns single biggest revelation is turning out to be M.I.A. herself.\nIn contrast to her comparatively sparkly and streamlined debut, Kala is clattering, buzzy, and sonically audacious. While it still sounds, for lack of a better word, as digital as its predecessor, the primarily Switch-produced album paradoxically reaches further than the produced-by-committee Arular in terms of its overall palette of sounds. From the disco bassline and gloopy Eurovision strings of the swimmy Bollywood cover \"Jimmy\" to the hairy didgeridoos and pitched-up elementary school raps (courtesy of Aboriginal schoolboy crew Wilcannia Mob) of \"Mango Pickle Down River\" to the bubbling synths of the gloriously woozy \"20 Dollar\", this represents a significant expansion of M.I.A.s already big tent of sounds. It also signifies her expansion as a performer. Where Arular saw her make the best of her fairly limited vocal abilities, Kala finds her reaching further outward, either by singing sweetly, as she does capably on \"Jimmy\", by peppering her chatter with sudden, free-floating melodies (\"20 Dollar\"), or by simply putting even more emphasis on the elastic qualities of her usual sing-songy delivery, as she does on the pinched-nose baile funk of \"World Town\" and the celebratory first single \"Boyz\"-- a triumph of her rhythmic patter if there ever was one.\nOn paper, M.I.A.s politics still register as conflicted as ever. Shes as enamoured with her own empty sloganeering as she is disapproving of the western worlds, and as likely to remind us that AK47s cost $20 apiece in Africa (\"20 Dollar\") as she is to adorn the chorus of her summer songs with cash register ch-chings and gunfire clatter (\"Paper Planes\"). An easy hybrid of island patois and Westernized slang, most of her lyrics register as being primarily in service of their rhythms, anyway; as with Arular, the things M.I.A. insinuates are often more rewarding than those she actually says. For example, bits and pieces of standard whitebread indie rock tunes turn up like whack-a-moles all throughout Kala. \"Bamboo Banga\" pinches a verse from Jonathan Richmans 1976 middle American driving anthem \"Roadrunner\" only to flip the metaphor from cars to desert animals; \"20 Dollar\" knowingly pilfers the bassline to New Orders \"Blue Monday\" before throwing in a lyrical nod to Pixies; even the island-tinged nursery rhyme of \"Paper Planes\" borrows from the Clashs \"Straight to Hell\". Whether were meant to infer anything larger (perhaps about colonization and cultural re-appropriation) from these little morsels is, of course, entirely up to us. But at the very least, it tells us that M.I.A.s intuition always leads her to interesting places.\nAnd make no mistake, shes in here. While there was a time when you might have been able to argue that Arular wasnt the product of a singular vision, this album makes it increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible, to say that about her output anymore. Even more interesting than how an artist acquires a listenership is what they do once they have it. With Kala, M.I.A.s made it abundantly obvious where her interests lie, and its not in toppling 130k. Who dares call her an opportunist now?",

        "article_text": "When Liars released Drums Not Dead last year, they convinced naysayers that their turn towards dank improvisation on 2004s critically reviled They Were Wrong, So We Drowned was part of some masterplan: It was seemingly the perfect refinement of Drowneds experiments in noise and rhythm. A year later, theyve taken another hard-left turn. With the bands expectation-defying back story, the surface way to read the new Liars is that its the murky, art-damaged sound of their last few albums with the rock reattached. Here, the raw two- and three-chord rigor of punk, 1960s garage (and even pop), and early 70s hard rock reasserts itself over the haunted sound of Drums Not Deads tricky, Kraut-ish polyrhythms.\nMuch of Liars is rhythmically simplistic-- even brutish-- giving it an unexpected caveman thrill after the more cerebral Drum. In some ways, it hearkens back to the beefy punk-funk of the bands earliest material, where they bulked up the skinny-legged skronk of the Gang of Four and James Chance on a meat-and-potatoes diet. But in other ways this heft feels totally new-- classic rock moves melted into a noisy reduction. \"Clear Island\" and \"Plaster Casts of Everything\" both throb to the kind of riffs and howling keyboards that go right for the American rock fans lizard brain.\nIn essence, Liars is scorched-blacktop biker music played through the art-rock filter of a band thats spent the last few years steeped in the bleak sounds of German new wave and early industrial. The riffs may be shackled to just a few notes, or restrained to a shrieking drone, but these are undeniably songs about the Power of the Guitar, not songs colored by atmospheric flecks of fuzz and feedback. The rhythm sections Mo Tuckerish momentum moves with the muscle mass of ZZ Top and the artless abandon of an upstart punk band. Liars have always been mesmerizing on stage-- even if thats often meant Angus Andrew flailing around in a soiled dress as much as the musicianship-- but Liars is the first time in a long time that live intensity has really come through on CD.\nOf course, this being a Liars record, unpredictability is a foregone conclusion, and the bands turn to heavy metal thunder only makes up a fraction of the albums songs. Elsewhere the group shows a flair for grotty pop pastiche that must have previously been buried under all that jagged percussion. \"Freak Out\" is such a dead ringer for the Spector-spooked feedback-pop of the Jesus and Mary Chain-- right down to winkingly dumb \"rocknroll\" song title-- that its impossible to ignore and likewise no accident on the bands part. \"Pure Unevil\" is shoegaze/dream pop if it had been concocted in a damp nuclear bunker rather than a paisley hippie crash pad. The song reverberates with a sickly but seductive metallic echo, with the drums and Andrews voice coming from the opposite ends of a mile-long sewer pipe and the lonesome guitar zigzagging off the slimy walls between them.\nThe inspiration behind \"Pure Unevil\" is less obvious than the outright homage of \"Freak Out\", but both offer newly tweaked takes on 80s British rock that are echoed in \"Houseclouds\", where the baggy funk rhythm and creaky organ sound like what might have resulted had the Happy Mondays set sail for Bowies Berlin rather than the ill-fated Barbados trip that produced Yes, Please. Its these laconic, menacing, and almost pretty moments that leaven Liars, adding skewed hooks to a band more infamous (rightly or wrongly) for willful noise and studio jamming. The murk (dub by way of stoner rock) remains constant throughout and moments of past inscrutability occasionally stop the record dead in its tracks. (\"Leather Prowler\" and \"The Dumb in the Rain\" go for that same kind of ethereal menace as \"Pure Unevil\" and get to the level of practice space dicking around.) But if Liars flowed smoothly, instead of stopping occasionally to worry at its scabs or piss all over the couch, it wouldnt be a Liars album.\nInstead, hairy warts and all, the album is another script-flipping overhaul from a band that too often gets forgotten when folks start toting up 21st century rocks front line. Inevitably some will claim the album is a concession designed to appease those who ditched the band when the band ditched the rock. But if it doesnt quite confound like They Were Wrong or thrill like Drums Not Dead, Liars still finds the band ignoring whatever you thought you wanted or needed from them, and doing what they damn well please. Just dont expect the next one to sound anything like it.",

        "article_text": "A compilation like this has been a long time coming. In 1997, Holland-based DJ/producer I-F basically invented electroclash with his underground dance hit \"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass\". Two years later, he helped catalyze the ongoing Italo-disco revival with one of the genres most essential compilations, Mixed Up in the Hague, Vol. 1, a DJ mix that pulled together defining cuts like Mr. Flagios vocoder-fronted \"Take a Chance\" and Klein \u0026 MBOs \"Blue Monday\"-influencing \"Dirty Talk\". Since then, other DJ mixes such as Morgan Geists Unclassics have kept vintage Italo on turntables, while I-Fs Italo-focused Cybernetic Broadcasting System has deepened the canon for real devotees.\n2007 may be remembered in some circles for its dance-rock hybrids: Klaxons and Justice, \"nu rave\" and \"blog house,\" each ably filling in for the dance-punk and electroclash of previous trend cycles. But its also a year when significant numbers of contemporary artists have embraced Italos Giorgio Moroder-styled synth arpeggios and brought them into the new millennium. Swedens Sally Shapiro and Cloetta Paris are breathing new life into the wispy synth-pop of Italo singer Valerie Dore, while the UKs Kathy Diamond is making beardo synth-pop with producer Maurice Fulton. The enigmatic Black Devil Disco Clubs 28 After couldve been made any time in the past 30 years. In the icy winter afterglow of Shapiros Disco Romance, Portland, Ore. acts Glass Candy and Chromatics helped keep Pitchfork HQs Italo love aflame with their first releases for Italians Do It Better, a new label from Troubleman Unlimited founder Mike Simonetti. Viva Italia.\nOn After Dark, the fledgling imprint assembles mostly vinyl-only or previously unreleased tracks by its current roster, which also includes Farah, Mirage, and Professor Genius. Produced in substantial part by Glass Candy guitarist Johnny Jewel, the comp is practically a Mixed Up in the Hague for present-day Italo, only with the darker ambiance its title implies. Where its precursor could at times play up Italos proclivity for cheese (once experienced in the U.S. via minor Eurodisco hits by the likes of Falco and Taco), this album wisely eschews ironic winks and kitsch-for-kitschs sake. Shapiro might find an indie pop romance in Italo, but After Dark lovingly re-imagines the style as retro-futurist noir-- a sleek soundtrack to lives of moral ambiguity in post-urban shadows.\nThe best tracks on the compilation embody that eerie slant on the old Italo throb/pulse without letting an air of minor-key reflection lapse into air quotes. On the extended 12\" version of Chromatics \"In the City\", the crackle of vinyl, distant synth swoops, skeletal drum patter, and singer Ruth Radelets narcoticized murmurs about \"midnight workers\" and a \"concrete river\" evokes rain hitting sidewalks. Glass Candys Italo coming-out, \"I Always Say Yes\", is conspicuously absent, but their hazy \"Rolling Down the Hills (Spring Demo)\" opens the disc with horns and singer Ida Nos deadly cold vocal presence.\nAfter Darks other acts approach the compilations dusky Italo aesthetic from similar perspectives. New Jersey-based Professor Genius homes in on the dystopian synth work of Vangelis and the upbeat expressiveness of Alexander Robotnick on instrumentals \"La Grotta (Demo)\" and album-closing \"Pegaso\". The vocoder makes its sole appearances on two tracks by Italys Mirage (\"Lady Operator\", \"Lake of Dreams\"), but Mirage uses the instrument to enhance singer Julius alienation, not to dish cheap nostalgic thrills. Texas-based Farah keep up the metronomic beats and analog cascades, but \"Dancing Girls (Suite 304 Demo)\" adds a section sung in Persian, while the spoken-word monologue of \"Law of Life\" sounds like a scripture reading from a church of the damned. Its one of the few moments on After Dark that seems stilted as much as reverent.\nFor plenty more reverence, look to the albums cover versions. Though occasionally distracting, After Darks updates of older compositions are good signposts: Glass Candys relatively direct take on Kraftwerks essential 1981 \"Computer Love\", or a lavishly orchestrated rendition of Paris-based Eurodisco group Belle Epoques 1977 \"Miss Broadway\" (later sampled by rapper Special Ed on 1990s \"Come On, Lets Move It\"). Not quite a cover, but Mirages remix of Indeeps 1982 classic \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\" adds evocative Italo synths to the originals spare, post-disco bass line and early hip-hop vocals.\nIn addition, both Glass Candy and Chromatics cover songs by ex-DNA member Robin Crutchfields Dark Day, particularly suiting Glass Candys shift from no-wave to disco. A tinny analog synth rotates through slight arpeggio variations without giving way to a shift in mood on Glass Candys cover of \"The Chameleon\", haunted by suicide and unnamed attackers. The steady snare thwack and detached atmospherics on Chromatics version of the catchy \"Hands in the Dark\" suggest Chromatics MySpace quote-- \"Night Drive\"-- fits them even better than it does Jan Hammer riffer Kavinskys recent \"Testarossa Nightdrive\", though here its surely a drive headed toward despair.\nSo there it is: Italo survived electroclash. And the recent explosion of Italo disco-inspired acts culminating (for now) in After Dark probably suggests the style will survive current indie-dance trends as well. In an interview for Australias Rave Magazine, Simian Mobile Discos James Ford (who produced the latest releases by Klaxons and Arctic Monkeys) says of his own dance-pop outfits swooning single \"I Believe\": \"Weve been getting into loads of slow, dreamy disco stuff-- the Emperor Machine, and a pair of bands in particular called Chromatics and Glass Candy-- and it partly came about like that.\" Just dont look for Justice to follow suit quite yet.",

        "article_text": "Black Lips can, to date, be depended on for raucousness, irresponsibility, occasionally pissing in their own mouths onstage, and sloppy garage tunes indebted to noise and punk as much as the bands Southern roots. Given all that, the idea of them hitting anything outside of a niche audience seemed slim. Theyre a go-to band for filth-rock puritans, even as their unhinged live shows have helped them slowly gain a larger audience with each albums release.\nGood Bad Not Evil, however, is the record where naysayers, disinterested friends and acquaintances, and anyone else within earshot has to sit up, shut up, and listen. The \"garage rock\" tag will perpetually follow this band, and while Im not saying it isnt sometimes apt, theres a difference between being a revival act and seeming blissfully out of time. Black Lips idea of being topical is writing a jilted love song to a girl named Katrina from New Orleans, and their idea of diversity is writing a country song about breaking a death to children (and sounding terribly inconvenienced by doing so). Its as if they missed the past 30 years of rock history; perhaps they drank the memory away.\nWhile it may not be as blistering as the bands early work, or even this years \"live\" Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo-- because where else could you really go after that?-- Good Bad nonetheless stands tall in their catalog for finding a way to turn it down without becoming tame. Here, Black Lips fold all of the bacchanalia into the corners of direct, vintage pop songs, so that the new tracks have taken on an ominous tone without being quite as off-the-rails as the bands reputation would suggest. Note the brief moments of backwards guitar in the otherwise, uh, lean \"Lean\", a twangy undistorted march with plenty of echo on the ragged vocals.\n\"Veni Vidi Vici\" is the biggest and wariest step forward, with a drum loop somewhere between Motown and Madchester, replete with a vibra-slap that will forever evoke hot summer evenings and a chorus thats as irrepressible and arrogant as a soccer chant. Yet for the most part, Black Lips dont stray from their comfort zone, they just push that zone outward. Their spooky quasi-mystical element gets much spookier on \"Lock and Key\", a blues vamp slithering its way from an Indian burial ground, and their flower-punk gets more flowery on \"It Feels Alright\" (formerly \"Good Bad Not Evil\"), where singer Cole Alexander varies his voice to evoke two singers-- a touch thats charming, almost comical, and completely punk.\nThe band is still preoccupied with its reckless bad-boy image, as \"Bad Kids\" is a country-inflected sing-along to the merits of irresponsibility that sounds so puerile its almost self-deprecating. Still, theyre hardly one-note here: \"Cold Hands\" is the records lead-off single and probably its catchiest song, but its more wounded than brash, lyrically occupied with trying the straight and narrow and failing rather than eschewing it entirely. Its a nice change of pace that hits a new emotional center-- for two-and-a-half minutes anyway.\nThrowbacks to earlier albums-- such as \"Slime and Oxygen\", with its stomping circular rhythms, caterwauling guitar bends, and more-than-usual vocal echo-- already pale next to the braver material. Even the records few missteps are at least adventurous, including colliding immaturity with more mysticism on the toy-piano-led \"Transcendental Light\". Were you to grab any of their older records-- which you really should-- you could hear a band out-freak the best of them. But Good Bad Not Evil is evidence that they want to do something more, which is heartening-- and here theyve accomplished it.",

        "article_text": "Janelle Monáes The ArchAndroid immediately dazzles you with its ambition. Its a 70-minute, 18-track epic comprising two suites, each beginning with an overture, telling a futuristic story starring a messianic android. Its not even the beginning of the saga-- the first sequence was her debut EP, Metropolis: The Chase Suite. The songs zip gleefully from genre to genre, mostly grounded in R\u0026B and funk, but spinning out into rap, pastoral British folk, psychedelic rock, disco, cabaret, cinematic scores, and whatever else strikes her fancy. Its about as bold as mainstream music gets, marrying the world-building possibilities of the concept album to the big tent genre-mutating pop of Michael Jackson and Prince in their prime. Monáe describes The ArchAndroid as an \"emotion picture,\" an album with a story arc intended to be experienced in one sitting, like a movie. It most certainly works in this way, but at first blush, its almost too much to take in all at once. The first listen is mostly about being wowed by the very existence of this fabulously talented young singer and her over-the-top record; every subsequent spin reveals the depths of her achievement.\nThe most impressive thing about The ArchAndroid isnt that it bounces between genres, but that it does so without compromising quality or cohesion. Its most recent antecedent is André 3000s The Love Below, but Monáe and her songwriting partners skillfully avoid that albums overreach and missteps, showing a similar level of fearless creativity but with greater focus and discipline. Despite the style-hopping, the album is sequenced so that many of the songs flow together seamlessly, and the shifts in tone seem intuitive rather than jarring. Monáes dramatic structure goes a long way toward keeping this from being an incoherent pile-up of affectations, providing a narrative through line that makes sense of the transitions, and implies momentum and resolution even if youre tuning out the lyrics.\nThe success of the album is also due to Monáes raw talent as a vocalist. She inhabits each style with natural grace, nailing the subtleties of rapped verses and tight harmonies as well as she can belt out a climax or deliver a punky growl. Much like fellow sci-fi magpie David Bowie, Monáe sings with the confidence of a star, but is essentially a vocal chameleon who places the needs of her songs ahead of her ego. Her performances can be jaw-dropping-- check out the transition from gentle folk phrasing to showstopping vocal runs on \"Oh, Maker\" for one example-- but she never gets in the way of her songs, which rely as much on her star power as the remarkable versatility of her band.\nThe ArchAndroid is deliberately conceived as a world unto itself, but Monáe very carefully places herself in a broader cultural context, as much out of ambition as wide-eyed fandom. Her liner notes list off inspirations for each track, ranging from references to Star Wars and Stevie Wonder album art to Salvador Dali and \"the atomic bombs in Muhammad Alis fists.\" She comes off like an enthusiastic student of the arts, eager to create on the level of her top-shelf reference points. Her naked desire to become iconic is endearing-- mainly because she is actually effective in presenting a look and a sound that is unmistakably her own, even when her influences are front and center. Everything that goes into her music comes out skewed, and even the most familiar elements of classic R\u0026B-- percussive horn stabs, scratchy rhythm guitar-- suddenly seem fresh and modern rather than nostalgic and reverent. Her choice of outside collaborators has a similar effect in creating a context for herself, establishing kinship and aesthetic continuity with the unapologetically bohemian poet Saul Williams, the forward-thinking hip-hop of Big Boi from OutKast, and Of Montreals flamboyant psychedelic funk.\nMonáes sci-fi mythology is an inspired addition to the rich canon of Afrofuturist art, but its not necessary to buy into her elaborate high concepts to get the basic appeal of her music. Her imagination and iconography deepen the record as an experience and give her license to go far out, but it ultimately serves as a fun, flashy framework for pop songs with universal lyrical sentiments. The first of the two suites mainly deals with identity and self-realization; the second is essentially a set of love songs. As with all the musical genres blended into The ArchAndroid, Monáe uses the conventions of science fiction as a means of communication, tapping into mythic archetypes for their immediate resonance and power. And where many concept albums run a high risk of being pompous, cryptic, and self-important, Monáe keeps things playful, lively, and accessible. Its a delicate balancing act, but Monáe and her band pull it off, resulting in an eccentric breakthrough that transcends its novelty.",

        "article_text": "Less than two months ago, few of us had ever heard of the Weeknd. Then, as soon as the creepy R\u0026B tracks from this free mixtape began to circulate, the hype engine revved up. There was the Drake cosign, the album art that looked like Spiritualized crossed with Tumblr art-porn, the missing vowel, the stylish samples, and the projects creators hiding in the shadows. You cant buy buzz like this, and the Weeknds quick rise to Internet fame, both in indie circles and in parts of the mainstream, raised fascinating questions about the blurrier-than-ever lines between those two audiences and the undergrounds newfound embrace of R\u0026B. (see also: Frank Ocean, Tri Angle Records, How to Dress Well.)\nThese are very interesting topics that have already spawned some good thinkpieces around the web, but set all that aside for a moment and youre still left with an album, same as always. And this album happens to be very good. The work of Toronto singer Abel Tesfaye and producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo (Drake producer Noah \"40\" Shebib, is not, as has been reported, involved in the project), House of Balloons is a remarkably confident, often troubling debut that excels at both forward-thinking genre-smearing and good old-fashioned songcraft. Take for starters the track \"What You Need\": with Burial-style vocal samples, techno scrape, and a sticky pop chorus, its far from your average R\u0026B number.\nOf course, the Weeknd are not without forebears-- producers from Rodney Jerkins to Static Major and recently The-Dream have been pushing the sonic boundaries of R\u0026B for some time now. Where the Weeknd differ, though, is that their source material pulls from the leftfield (the title track re-purposes Siouxsie and the Banshees \"Happy House\", two songs here ride mutated Beach House samples), and their approach is more about building vibe and atmosphere. Theyre great at rich, woozy compositions that send Tesfayes aching falsetto through the mix. An example is \"The Morning\", which feels at first like a spacey synth instrumental before a stuttering digital drumbeat announces this massive, swaying chorus that enters your brain and refuses to leave.\nThe groups penchant for druggy atmospherics is mirrored in their lyrical content, which is overtly sexual, narcotics-focused, and occasionally downright frightening. Debauchery is obviously nothing new in R\u0026B, but this takes it a step further-- the drugs are harder, the come-ons feel predatory and lecherous, and the general feeling is self-hating rather than celebratory. On opener \"High for This\", Tesfaye handholds a partner through some strange sex act, singing, \"Trust me, girl, you wanna be high for this.\" \"Glass Table Girls\" is pretty clearly about doing coke. Because we dont know these guys, its hard to say whether these are real-life tales or imaginative storytelling-- you want to think the latter, but ultimately the anonymity makes it seem more disturbing.\nWhat makes this whole thing work in an album context is that all the thematic and sonic pieces fit together-- these weird, morning-after tales of lust, hurt, and over-indulgence (\"Bring the drugs, baby, I can bring my pain,\" goes one refrain) are matched by this incredibly lush, downcast music. Its hard to think of a record since probably the xxs debut (definitely a touchstone here) that so fully embodies such a specific nocturnal quality. And even though the image of nightlife painted by the Weeknd isnt a place youd ever want to live, its one thats frankly very hard to stop listening to.",

        "article_text": "\"Really I think I like who Im becoming,\" Drake told us cautiously on his second album Take Care. On its followup Nothing Was the Same, hes thought about it some more.\"Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga!\" he screams. \"I could go an hour on this beat, nigga!\" The song, \"Tuscan Leather\", which opens the record, is six full minutes long with no chorus, a point Drake is eager for us to absorb: \"This is nothing for the radio/ But theyll still play it though/ Cuz its the new Drizzy Drake, thats just the way it go.\"\nThe Drake Era has ended; welcome to the Drake Regime. Aubrey Grahams gone from an unlikely rapper to an accepted rapper to maybe the biggest rapper out, all in four years, and hes the genres biggest current pop crossover star. Kanye has, for the moment, stepped out of the pop-radio wars, which means that Drake currently has no meaningful competition. On Nothing Was the Same, he acts accordingly-- the mansion doors swing shut behind you and he mostly stops pretending to be nice. \"Im on my worst behavior,\" he leers, over a glowering low-end synth and an insectile battery of defaced-sounding percussion, courtesy of DJ Dahi. Its the meanest-sounding thing Drake has rapped over, and he matches it with some of his angriest lyrics, a series of sputtered \"muhfuckas never loved us\" surrounding an extended riff on Ma$es verse on \"Mo Money Mo Problems\".\nAs Drake albums go, this is the Drakiest: Except for Jay Z, who shows up at the end of the album, Nothing Was the Same is an entirely solo affair, and all of Drakes tendencies are dialed up. Even for a rapper known for sniping at non-famous girlfriends on record, hes breathtakingly petty here: The album is four days old on the internet, and already his line \"The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree/ Ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\" from \"From Time\" is infamous, a reference so specific that the actual Courtney has had to put a padlock on her social-media life. Drake has been talking to old flames who have no equivalent soap box to climb on to talk back since before \"CeCes Interlude\", of course, but as hes gotten more famous, theyve grown more malicious, and here they feel like a series of emotional drone strikes.\nOn \"Paris Morton Music\", he relishes the thought of showing up at his high school reunion, watching everyone \"go through security clearance,\" and on \"Too Much\", he airs out his family: \"Money got my family going backwards/ No dinners, no holidays, no nothing,\" he laments, before going in on his uncle, his cousins, and even his mother: \"I hate the fact that my mom cooped up in the apartment, telling herself that shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit.\" Drake recently performed this song on Jimmy Fallon, apologizing briefly to his family before tearing into it. The album title, in context, reads like a self-fulfilling prophecy viewed from the rear view, an acknowledgment that hes cutting final ties, torching the last bridges. He might like who hes become, but you can hear he doesnt expect anyone else to.\nThats okay: Loneliness, self-afflicted or otherwise, has always been Drakes most reliable fuel. His  albums draw strength from their insularity; when everyone outside them in mainstream rap was piling on epic minor-key horns and turning their songs into armored tanks, Drake drew the curtains. His sound was set apart more by what wasnt there-- snare claps, hi-hats-- then what was. Nothing Was the Same is Drake and 40s most audacious experiment yet in how far inward they can push their sound; a lot of the album sounds like a black hole of all 40s previous productions being sucked into the center. Song-to-song transitions, which have always been melty and blurry, are more notional than ever. \"Wu-Tang Forever\" is a sunken glimmer of piano with a tiny tag of RZAs voice, screaming \"Its Yourz,\" before shading, at some point, into \"Own It\".\nThere is no uncomplicated forward motion in Drake songs; usually one small element worms forward while everything sits around it, a haze of rhythmic and harmonic indecision. Drake continues his qualified, complicated claiming of Houston on Nothing, rapping \"I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it\" on \"Too Much\". But the only quality his music shares with Houston rap is its vague relationship to momentum. On \"Started From the Bottom\", the bass isnt even a settled pitch, but a buckling floor beneath the destabilized-sounding pianos, which scrabble down its side. \"305 to My City\" sits almost completely flat, a ticking snare the only indication of a pulse.\nThe only thing tumbling endlessly forward, of course, are Drakes words, one emerging breathlessly after the other. He has never boasted many of the skills that define a technically skilled rapper, but he has cleared away any obstacles to his tangled thoughts in 40s muted music and let his wordy lines climb up the walls like kudzu. To live in Drakes music is to come away with his words smudged on you like newsprint ink. His eye-rollers and his stunners are all linked together, one long runaway train of sentiments: \"I wanna take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation/ And influence a generation thats lacking in patience/ Ive been dealin with my dad, speaking of lack of patience/ Just me and my old man, getting back to basics/ We been talking about the future and time that we wasted/ When he put that bottle down, girl, that niggas amazing,\" he raps on \"From Time\". Its hard not to feel exhausted, slightly, after an albums worth of these torrents.\nYou sense that Drake is exhausted, too. There is an intriguing whiff of third act rot hanging in the air on Nothing Was the Same, and because Drake is such a deft micro-manager of his own narrative, hes drawing our attention to it, telegraphing it in his lyrics and dramatizing the sense that whatever he does after this album, it cant quite be this again. Hes \"somewhere between psychotic and iconic\" on \"Furthest Thing\", promising to \"break everyone off before I break down.\"\nThere are big, friendly singles as well-- notably, the bar-mitzvah floor-filler \"Hold On, Were Going Home\", which borrows its smoothly bumping glide from \"Sexual Healing\". The song is terrific, one of Drakes best pure pop songs ever and instantly a standard. It is also out of place on this dimly lit album, which is the most morose and triumphant of Drakes career. \"My lifes a completed checklist,\" he boasts on \"Tuscan Leather\"-- for Drake, its another reason to feel superior. But its also what you say right before you die, and I cant imagine an admission more depressing.",

        "article_text": "Before Danielle and Este Haim were riding motorbikes in the sun, catching fish with their bare hands, or making potential suitors weep with heartache, they were Valli Girls. The Los Angeles sisters played guitar and bass, respectively, in the tween-pop quintet that was assembled and signed to major label Columbia in 2004, with 1980s soft-rock linchpin Richard Marx attached as a creative contributor. The results were decidedly mixed: there was the acoustic melodrama of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants soundtrack cut \"Always There in You\", the cruelly ironic \"Born to Lead\" (\"My independent voice will have its say\"), and most notoriously, \"Its a Hair Thing\", the dog whistle-pitched theme song for the short-lived animated TV show \"Trollz\".\nThis early group wasnt the beginning of the Haim sisters musical career—the pair had been performing covers with the rest of their family, including youngest sister Alana, since they were old enough to hold instruments. \"Were just ourselves,\" a 17-year-old Este Haim was quoted as saying in a 2005 press release that touted the Valli Girls debut album, Valli Nation. That sentiment wasnt entirely true: as a Fader story from earlier this year detailed, musical prodigies Danielle and Este werent all that into playing songs that they didnt write, so they pulled out of their contract. The family band was christened with the endearingly dorky name Rockinhaim, thereafter shortened to Haim when the sisters decided to strike out on their own in 2006.\nSo far, the story of Haim has seemed ripe for the type of movie youd catch playing on VH1 on a Sunday afternoon and Days Are Gone, the trios outstanding full-length debut, is the latest plot twist. The album arrives just as Haims impeccably crafted mix of influences—soft rocks incandescent glow, R\u0026Bs sensuality, the spiky-yet-polished effervescence of pop-rock—are more fashionable than ever. But Haim werent just raised on these genres; they were raised to perform them; they may benefit from perfect timing, but they scan as anything but opportunistic.\nSince Days Are Gone single and blog-buzz fire-starter \"Forever\" made the rounds in early 2012, Haim have often been mentioned alongside Fleetwood Mac; critic Ann Powers recently described their sound as an encapsulation of Billboards Hot 100 singles of 1987, which included the Macs Tango in the Night single \"Little Lies\". The comparison is not without merit—much of the dusky, ebullient \"Honey \u0026 I\", one of Days Are Gones highest highs, sounds as if The Reminder-era Feist fused together the acoustic riffs of \"I Dont Want to Know\" and \"Never Going Back Again\". But Haim also channel the best elements of their current peers: Phoenixs compressed pop economics, the cool-handed spaciousness of Arctic Monkeys recent work, and Spoons wound-coil precision.\nThe latter quality is Haims secret weapon. Along with drummer and L.A. scene fixture Dash Hutton, Haim sound as tight and in-the-pocket as youd expect from a group of people that have spent most of their lives making music. Simian Mobile Discos James Ford (Arctic Monkeys, Klaxons) and studio-man-of-the-moment Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Usher) both receive co-writing and production credits and contribute just the right touches to Haims sleek, streamlined arrangements. The records mix is translucent and refreshingly bare-bones, which affords plenty of space for Days Are Gones many indelible hooks—the twitchy R\u0026B of \"If I Could Change Your Mind\", \"Dont Save Me\"s rollicking bursts of euphoria, the resonant melancholia of closer \"Running If You Call My Name\"—to work their uncanny magic.\nWhen you hear about the influences and consider just how slick the record can be, you might imagine Haim coming over as faceless. But the bands most unusual quality on Days Are Gone is their ability to absorb inputs and continue to sound distinct. The albums punchy title track was co-written by Jessie Ware, another artist whos made a name replicating the sounds of pops past, along with Wares frequent songwriting collaborator Kid Harpoon (\"Wildest Moments\", \"Night Light\"); Ware and Harpoons style is usually easy to pick out, but its barely felt on \"Days Are Gone\", as Danielle Haims staccato delivery pops and locks where Wares vocals would have crested and swelled. That Haim retain their identity through collaboration speaks to their confidence. \nThe lyrics on Days Are Gone arent necessarily built to withstand close analysis; largely, the words function to add a bit of weight to the effortless, feather-light melodies, but Haim do know how to turn a phrase. \"The Wire\", especially, has some of groups most effective lines, a level-headed act of kiss-off kindness (\"I gave it all away/ Just so I could say that/ Well I know that youre gonna be OK anyway\") paired with a rolling melody that makes the song one of the most benevolent breakup anthems since Robyns \"Call Your Girlfriend\". \nDays Are Gone is so polished that Haim could easily be seen as clinical and lifeless, but their lighthearted attitude complements their recording rigor. Whether theyre covering Miley Cyrus and Sheryl Crow, making \"bass faces\", or reuniting Rockinhaim by bringing their own parents on stage for a rendition of \"Mustang Sally\", Haim come over as affable, playing-to-the-rafters rock stars as well as studio pros. Taken as a whole, the project is a testament to whats most important, and Days Are Gones divine pleasures suggest that, rock history be damned, family business doesnt always have to be dysfunctional.",

        "article_text": "Beach Houses sound was fully formed at the time of their 2006 debut. They had slow, shadowy dream-pop down; at times they recalled Mazzy Star or Galaxie 500, but songs like \"Apple Orchard\" and \"Master of None\" had a dark and blurry resonance all their own. Artists that start out so assured and distinctive can run into trouble on second, third, and fourth records. Hardcore fans are there no matter what, but others may wonder: Do I need another album from this band? When Im in the mood for what they bring, cant I just put on what I already have?\nTeen Dream, Beach Houses third album and first for Sub Pop, obliterates these concerns. This is both the most diverse and most listenable of their three full-lengths, and yet it never seems like a compromise. It feels like the product of careful, thoughtful growth, bringing in new influences-- bits of mid-1970s Fleetwood Mac, sparkling indie pop, even a few soul and gospel touches--- while maintaining the groups core sound. Teen Dream is a stirring reminder that good things can happen when you move out of your comfort zone.\nThe interplay between Victoria Legrands voice and droning keyboards and Alex Scallys guitars is still the key element of the bands aesthetic. But here, each song has its own palette, which creates new possibilities. So the repetitive guitar figure, double-time kick drum, and crashing cymbals in the opening \"Zebra\" immediately suggest movement, signaling that this record will have a dramatic sweep unheard on the bands more pensive beginnings. And the whispery \"ah-ah-ah\" backing vocals that open \"Norway\" imply a new openness to the allure of pop pleasure, as that bit of ear candy finds a sharp contrast in the seasick-sounding slide that hovers over the verses. More somber ballads like \"Better Times\" and \"Silver Soul\" have the thick, churning gloom familiar from earlier records, but they acquire more force by being placed alongside tracks that allow for more light. Front to back, the arrangements and sequencing are superb.\nDespite the brighter, more pop-informed sound and an album title that brings to mind the hazy nostalgia of youth, Teen Dream has a pretty sad heart. Because the music is so effective, the churn of emotions is there even when you dont know exactly what Legrand is singing about (this can happen easily with her unusual phrasing). But a closer listen reveals songs about uncertainty, doubt, and feeling beaten down by the world. \"Walk in the Park\" sounds romantic on paper, but this is a journey taken alone as a way to try and forget someone who is no longer around. The choppy verses, nudged along by the sort of cheap drum machine Beach House use expertly to suggest loneliness, explode sideways into a shimmering chorus that finds Legrand busting out a time-heals-all-wounds affirmation over a calliope organ. This chorus turn is a big moment that gets more affecting with more listens, lunging from resigned sorrow to an anxious plea, and it accomplishes this mood swing with a damn catchy melodic hook. A similar lift-off happens on \"10 Mile Stereo\", when the song shifts from its deliberate opening bars to its rushing and noisy main section thats as close as Beach House have come to true shoegaze. The gorgeous racket is affixed to a song about feeling dead inside after another failed relationship: \"Limbs parallel/ We stood so long, we fell.\"\nThough the Teen Dream lyrics are printed in the booklet, they lose their power on the page. \"Real Love\", from the albums less immediate but equally rewarding second half, has my favorite imagery from the record, and is also Legrands best vocal performance. At first, its just her and a piano, with chords that lean toward gospel. Hearing her voice in such a spare setting reinforces just how rich, earthy, and, dare I say it, soulful it really is. \"I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs,\" she sings, \"Theres someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom, boom, boom.\" Theres pain in these lines, but her cracking, husky intonation amplifies it tenfold. Its easy to miss that Legrands presence is forceful and deep rather than ethereal and angelic, but here these qualities stand out like never before, lending her darker laments extra weight.\nAs with Liars Drums Not Dead, the Teen Dream CD comes with a DVD containing videos for each of the records songs, all by different directors. The clips range from 8mm found footage to colorful Flash collages to silly stories that clash with the music in a big way. To be honest, its a little overwhelming to be dealing with 10 videos when youre getting to know an album, and Im not sold on this sort of package at this point. The DVD, while it looks reasonably interesting, seems like something to spend time with later, after the record has had a chance to sink in. For now, Im more inclined to close my eyes and imagine my own pictures for Teen Dream. The music has been inspiring some pretty vivid ones.",

        "article_text": "Its disingenuous to talk about Los Angeles New Yorker-profiled, vegan-snacks-serving, book-lending, all-ages venue the Smell with the same high-art vocabulary youd use to dissect other creative collectives, like Andy Warhols Factory-- the Smells constituency (L.A.s optimistic experimental art pack) appears un-fixated on fame, self-aggrandizement, or furthering its nascent mythology. To an outsider, the Smell is idealistic and romantic, a stroller-friendly, cheap-haircut-hocking haven thats as functional as it is fruitful. Save Baltimores Wham City, its been a while since American music fans have had a similar hometown scene to get riled up about; regional culture has been fractured and marginalized by the internet, and being too focused on anything local-- except produce, maybe-- feels depressingly provincial in 2008. Consequently, its weirdly thrilling that a community-sponsored, community-supported art space can attract (and sustain) such a horde of admirable bands.\nNo Age, along with Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, Lavender Diamond, BARR, and a handful of others, are mainstays at the Smell; the cover of No Ages 2007 EP compilation, Weirdo Rippers, famously features the exterior of the club, and guitarist Randy Randall reportedly helped mine trenches in the venues concrete floor so that a second bathroom could be installed to accommodate new crowds. Given the critical success of Weirdo Rippers, No Ages scope has now expanded well beyond Los Angeles, and Nouns, their first full-length, is appropriately ambitious.\nA guitar/drums duo (Randall and drummer/vocalist Dean Spunt) with a penchant for self-recorded samples, No Age are mostly unconcerned with things like space or pause, and Nouns is gorgeously thick-- a hazy, delirious expanse thats both comforting and disorienting. Opener \"Miner\" begins and ends in murk, and in between Randall and Spunt sputter and twitch and pound, alternately revealing and concealing a sweet, taut melody-- such is No Ages agenda, burying an addictive little singalong in layers of effects and fuzz.\n\"Eraser\" is more immediately user-friendly, opening with sunny guitar chirps and a knee-slapping drumbeat, before Spunt starts barking intelligible lyrics (\"Wait for the foreman now get paid/ Wait and see the list of shit you made\") and the music goes steady and frantic. \"Eraser\" is a summer song in the sweatiest, most realistic sense-- its not the Beach Boys gooey, über-idealized, convertibles-and-beach-volleyball version, its the waiting-for-the-bus, sweaty and desperate but still-sorta-excited-about-all-that-sunshine take. \"Here Should Be My Home\" is similarly exuberant, full of power chords and distortion; its arguably the poppiest thing No Age have recorded to date (all those cries of \"baby\" are practically bubblegum), and accordingly, completely addictive. \"Sleeper Hold\", meanwhile, is the sound-- both literally and metaphysically-- of everything happening all at once, an ecstatic, feedback-addled lullaby.\nSome fans might pine-- at least at first-- for the (vaguely) more experimental, less riff-driven muck of Weirdo Rippers, but Nouns is a more thoughtful, coherent (and still plenty dirty) version of what No Age began building with all those EPs. Listening to Nouns, its hard to comprehend how just two people can manage to make so much noise while still sounding so subdued and mysterious-- its easier to imagine Randall and Spunt spewing these songs underwater, bursting forth from some colossal California quarry rather than a tiny, stuffy art space a few blocks from L.A.s skid row. Nouns is so cacophonous, so fertile, and so ripe with sound that parsing out the samples and effects and various layers of guitar is nearly impossible; besides, its way more satisfying to just close your eyes and just enjoy it. Ultimately, its part of No Ages allure that Nouns is so difficult to figure out, that it manages to be so big while coming from a place so small: All youll know for sure is that you want to listen longer. Maybe forever.",

        "article_text": "Words like \"accomplished\" and \"discipline\" seem opposed to the very ideals on which punk was founded. But L.A. dream-punks No Age seek to straighten up and fly a little straighter on Everything in Between, tamping down their whiplash tempos, prying open their songs to let a little more air in, further settling into their frantic sound. Their songwritings grown in leaps and bounds, evincing unexpected depth yet never shying from a satisfying detour. And their sounds become more balanced; hot blasts of dissonance have been turned into smoldering pockets of noise. Everything in Between is a grown-up, downright respectable record about the pitfalls of being a lifer with a 9 to 5, and the sounds matured along with their outlook. Less ferocious, more deliberate but in many ways more compelling, Everything in Between finds No Age matching a new, nuanced approach to their expansive noise.\nBy this point, you probably know what goes into a No Age song: A scuzzy intro jumps face-first into a thrashabout hook, either jumping again into another firestorm or swelling to a swift end. On 2008s Nouns, they cut these ripcords through with huge, gorgeous clouds of sound. It worked beautifully at the LP level, but the songs themselves felt shot out of a cannon. They didnt always leave room for nuance.\nEverything in Between fiinds a little space for everything. Randy Randalls guitar now buzzes and howls throughout these songs, providing them with a backbone rather than simply standing behind them and shoving. Dean Spunts drums go from a wet thwack to a wild carnival stomp as the situation dictates, seeming to take on new forms as the LP progresses. Every tone, from Randalls guitar squeals to Spunts impassioned shouts, feels treated, scuffed up, warped. But the sounds are more spectral, less squalid, a product of Randalls varying his guitar tones and the duos embracing a few more patient tempos. Rather than stepping to one huge precipice at the edge of every song, theyve made them more jagged, played up the inter  nal  tensions, and traded in one big thrill for a seemingly self-propelled series of precision blasts.\nStructurally, Everything in Between doesnt shy far from the Nouns formula: Several hook-forward numbers anchor the front half, the floatier stuff mostly shows up around the two-thirds mark, and they close the thing out with a total banger. But the tunes themselves are longer and slightly more traditional (they actually liked a couple of these choruses enough to sing them twice), and the punk rock urgency of their past works been tempered slightly by a more deliberate pace and Randalls trickier, rustier, less world-beating guitar riffage. It all calls to mind less straight-up SoCal punk and more rangy, roughhewn indie rock; theres flecks of Dinosaur Jr.s lazy crunch in \"Valley Hump Crash\", plenty of Hüsker Düs pop urgency in \"Common Heat\", enough Sonic Youth to go around everywhere. Theyve opened up their tone palette so much here, its as though just about anything could be around the corner. The drone bits feel especially purposeful this time around; \"Positive Amputation\" has all the skyward motion of an Explosions in the Sky tune, and nearly every time they pull back into these sonic curlicues, the record seems to breathe. Theyve long felt like a hardcore band with excellent noise instincts, but Everything in Between is where you realize theyre mostly a rock band with a ridiculously good ear for sound.\nTuning into No Age for Dean Spunts lyrics has always seemed a bit of a fools errand; his tales of youthful malaise are accurately but rarely vividly rendered, and besides, its not always been easy to make him out through the din. Spunts voice, though still occasionally inaudible, sits far higher in the mix here on Everything in Between, sticking his lyrics-- and his thin, pleading voice-- at the center of some of these songs. Spunts still not exactly a masterful singer, and hes just shy of the pitch a time or two here. Hes putting his voice to better use though, with a batch of lyrics that underscore the motivational appeals to action that have long hovered around the No Age project. If the records got a thesis statement, its somewhere in its first line: \"One time is all I need to know my jobs complete,\" Spunt notes, before proceeding with his most detailed, deliberate record yet. Despite the obvious care that went into it, Everything in Betweens hewn-from-pure-noise songwriting still feels more like a ridiculously good run of happy accidents than anything resembling hard work-- and its shot through with an unassuming left coast attitude that makes the record all the more ingratiating.\nEverything in Between begins with a series of hits from Spunts drums; it ends with fireworks. Not the big crash-boom city-spanners, nah; strictly bodega-special bottle rockets, popping along behind Spunts drums in the chorus of \"Chem Trails\". Its sort of perfect; this is no lavish, decadent affair, no grab at some greater glory. This is a pair of friends getting together to make a truly compelling racket, and while the wildly successful Everything in Between is certainly cause for celebration, making some big scene would throw its balance off completely. Everything in Between certainly doesnt feel like some huge statement of purpose, some radical reinvention, some big move toward the mainstream; simply a sonically chameleonic, musically generous, seriously compelling record from a couple guys whove once again got all their pedals in a row.",

        "article_text": "\"I hear a lot of music thats just lazy-- you know, people in their bedrooms singing some shit into the microphone.\" Thats California singer and songwriter Julia Holter, talking to Pitchfork recently. This passage from the interview leapt out at me because it gets at what makes her second full-length album special. Like a lot of home-recorded music in the indie sphere in the last few years, Ekstasis makes heavy use of atmosphere. Theres plenty of reverb and vocal tracks are braided together into drones; its the kind of swirly production thats good for hiding mistakes. But nothing Holter does feels random. This album is above all careful, and its deliberate construction allows it to work on a different plane from most music that scans as \"ethereal.\" Ekstasis is not the sort of oceanic wash you lose yourself in; instead, Holters music has a way of snapping tiny moments and small sonic gestures into focus. Ekstasis is above all smart, and it makes no apologies for it.\nHolters work exists at the intersection between pop and \"serious\" music. The mayor of that particular corner is Laurie Anderson, and there are obvious parallels between the two. You can hear Anderson in Holters flat, chant-like inflection, which allows her music and lyrics to do the emotional work. You can also hear it in her love of simplicity and approach to mixing traditional instrumentation and electronics. Another touchstone is the dark magic of Klaus Nomi. Its not just that the tracks like \"Fur Felix\" bear a similarity to Nomi tracks like \"Keys of Life\", theres also an undercurrent of ritualism and theatricality in Holters music. Ekstasis is certainly mysterious, but not because meaning is hard to pin down; its more that there are so many possible meanings, so many places to focus your attention.\nListening to Ekstasis, I keep thinking about how it differs from music that feels superficially similar. The music of Julianna Barwick, for example, has liturgical overtones, bringing to mind stone and glass and voices rising in cathedrals. Barwick wants to tap into something beyond words. But Holters music sounds like it was assembled in a dusty library a floor or two below the sanctuary. Its a few shades darker, but its also based on ideas first and intuition second. Despite using vocoders, drum machines, and electronics, it feels \"old\" in part because Holter so deliberately connects her music to the distant past. On her debut album, she did so by basing her songs on a play from ancient Greece by Euripides; here, she pulls words and scenarios from literature and mixes them with her own idiosyncratic approach to words. The songs include quotes from the likes of Virginia Woolf and Frank OHara. A line from OHaras poem \"Having a Coke With You\"-- \"I look at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world\"-- animates \"Moni Mon Ami\", nestled amid the twinkling synths, strings, and keyboards that sound like harpsichord are original lines like \"Hours become years when youre gone!\"\nWhere Holters Tragedy felt more like a tapestry, with vocal tracks mixed in with instrumental bits and interludes, Ekstasis leans toward proper songs, and it palette is more uniform. \"In the Same Room\", despite its chintzy drum machine and mechanized hand-claps, is actually a drama unfolding in close quarters. \"In this very room, we spent the day and looked over antiquities. Dont you remember?\" to which the other character replies, \"Do I know you? I cant recall this face but I want to.\" You see it play out on paper on the lyric sheet and it feels like a linear exchange, but Holter twists the voices together and the narrative folds in on itself. Its there as pure, gorgeous sound if you want it-- you dont need to know what the songs are about to immerse yourself in this record-- but the deeper you go, the more the songs open up.\n\"I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry...\" is a lyric from \"Goddess Eyes\", a new version of a song that appeared on Tragedy. Its a line from the Euripides play that inspired her first album, and its delivered in processed voice reminiscent of a vocoder. So we have a 2,000-year old phrase run through a device that makes a human sound like a 1970s version of the robots of the future. And at the center of all this time travel stands Julia Holter, pulling in references and sounds from everywhere and shaping them into a music thats both haunting and life-affirming, something to make you dream and think.",

        "article_text": "Trevor Powers doesnt come off as older and wiser than his 23 years: just look at any picture of him, with his slight build and cherubic mop of curls, or take one listen to his nasal, keening voice. Likewise, his heartfelt 2011 debut The Year of Hibernation dealt more in truth and honesty than profundity or authority, skirting cliché while affecting people in meaningful ways. These qualities are about the only things that havent changed for Youth Lagoon on Wondrous Bughouse. This record broadens Powers musical and lyrical scope into something universal in a literal and figurative sense, evoking the cosmos, heaven, and hell. But Powers sounds curious and awestruck rather than naïve, someone who explores this lush and frightening soundworld instead of explaining it.\nThe cosmetic changes are obvious. If youve been paying attention to sonics over the past couple of years, youll recognize the saturated, bottom-heavy production as that of Ben H. Allen. After hearing Allen give a subwoofer shape-up to previously brittle bands like Deerhunter, Animal Collective, and Washed Out, the pairing seems almost inevitable. But while the production is an upgrade, the real growth is thematic. Hibernation obsessed over escape and became defined by its limitations, whether it was its meager recording budget or just the sense that Powers felt trapped by his surroundings in Boise. But Bughouse looks inward and discovers the endless possibilities of imagination and introspection.\nYouth Lagoon is still very much an internally-focused project and, with its abundance of effect pedals and stereo panning tricks, Wondrous Bughouse will likely be branded as a headphones album. Dont believe it. As with Hibernation, this is a record thats meant to be cranked as loud as possible; for one, volume decompresses these thick songs, amplifying the crucial addition of live drums on \"Raspberry Cane\" and \"Mute\". More importantly, Wondrous Bughouse needs room to breathe from a songwriting standpoint. With Powers lyrics and Allens production striving to create a celestial whole, Bughouse is meant to conjure infinite space. \nThis much is conveyed by the sonar blips that take up the three-minute opener \"Through Mind and Back\" before fading into the spellbinding \"Mute\". Nearly every song on Hibernation began quietly, so its jarring to hear Youth Lagoon take a more widescreen turn-- echoing drums, gleaming peals of delayed guitar, all washed by ocean spray reverb. This lasts for one minute before a detuned loop of bells recasts \"Mute\" as a juggernaut, a steady, booming drum beat framing a strident vocal performance from Powers, a guitar solo that recalls Doug Martschs expressive, longing leads, a minor-key piano loop that appears ready to take the song to a completely different plateau before cruelly cutting out. \nThese songs are all bigger and bolder without being unnecessarily complicated. While Powers melodies are simple and immediately memorable like nursery rhymes, everything surrounding him is in flux. The songs on Wondrous Bughouse are continually subjected to flange and phase effects, and its not the gentle, headswimming \"whoosh\" that typified recent records such as Lonerism or mbv. The cranked oscillation gives these songs a proper sense of danger and hyper-alertness. The combination of the processing and Powers devious lyrics (\"I wont die easily/ Thats what they say when I erupt into laughter\") gives the calliope-like melody of \"Attic Doctor\" a fitting, monstrous overtone. The synth progression that emerges during the anthropomorphic grotesquerie \"Pelican Man\" would be a perfect evocation of Elephant 6s Beatles obsession, but the pulsing modulations turn into something closer to slasher-flick fare. \nIts often scary stuff, more reminiscent of Syd Barretts bad-trip fairy tales. Though Powers isnt dealing with death in a manner that conveys gravitas or experience, Wondrous Bughouse is very much about mortality, albeit filtered through surrealism, parable, and metaphor. Rather than a simple longing for the past, Powers feels obsessed with human frailty and decay. Similarly, the songs of Bughouse arent subject to tangents so much as following a dream logic working where any thought, regardless of how awesome or fearsome it is, doesnt end until it reaches a conclusion it sees fit. \nPowers choice to write most of these fanciful flights in waltz time gives everything a properly anachronistic feel. The hopscotch melody on \"Dropla\" makes it sound like a playground chant and the lyrics see its narrator dealing with death in a selfish, forgivably childlike way, hanging on to faint hope (\"youll never die, youll never die\") and lashing out when the prayers go unanswered (\"you werent there when I needed\"). Between the threatening taunts of \"Attic Doctor\", we hear vast stretches of music for the Peanuts gang to ice skate to: \"Third Dystopia\" refracts a sea shanty through multiple funhouse mirrors; the submerged second half of \"The Bath\" places Powers somewhere between a baptism and a drowning. On \"Raspberry Cane\", Powers sees himself as irredeemable (\"Im polluted by my blood/ So help me cut it out and rinse it down the drain\") and while closer \"Daisyphobia\" views humanity as \"mortals on the run\" from an all-seeing God, Wondrous Bughouse slinks towards an disturbing and unresolved conclusion, a slow fade of distant synth whinnies and stumbling, inexact beats.\nThough unnerving, it is familiar, albeit in a style of indie rock that was prominent when Powers was, by his own admission, listening to Bad Boy records Allen mightve played a part in. Think of the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Grandaddy, Sparklehorse, Modest Mouse, Built To Spill, all bands who in some way combined a projected naivety with grand designs: adolescent vocals picking at metaphysical mysteries, an insatiable curiosity with the capabilities of the studio. But Youth Lagoon is also a spiritual progeny in terms of geography. All these bands emerged far from media centers-- Oklahoma City, upstate New York, Modesto, central Virginia, Issaquah, Wash., and of course, Powers own Boise. Listeners often try to discern something special about creating art in places like these, whether the scarcity of live shows and bands makes music more important or a lack of urban stimuli allows for deeper meditation on the big picture. Though the songs themselves are wonderful, thats the powerful source Powers taps into here: if you feel like the dark center of the universe or simply need a little space, Wondrous Bughouse obliges.",

        "article_text": "Everything changes, but Axel Willner stays the same. Since the Swedish producers debut LP as the Field, 2007s techno-pop landmark From Here We Go Sublime, Willner has patiently augmented the projects sound with each successive release, adding subtle touches that are significant in scope and texture. He operates with a workmanlike consistency, putting out an album about every two years, each with nearly identical packaging—two lines of artfully scribbled text on a beige background. On his first three albums as the Field, this simple design reinforced the Fields overarching aesthetic congruency. Without even cracking the spine of Cupids Head, his fourth, its obvious change is afoot, and the visual shift feels significant. Compared to the glimmering, soft-hued soundscapes of 2011s Looping State of Mind, the new record is a moodier work, perfectly balancing sleekness and aggression.\nWillners recent solo performances have abandoned the body-moving tendencies of the Fields full-band shows, favoring drones and formlessness more associated with his Loops of Your Heart project. Cupids Head is thick and dense, a miles-long oil slick that radiates ultraviolet hues, and it has some overlap with his other project. It also finds the Field occasionally coming full-circle, with qualities that recall Here We Go Sublime. Besides being Willners strongest collection since that game-changing debut, Cupids Heads six lengthy jams take cues from Sublimes centerpiece, \"The Deal\", an intimidating monolith of techno that swells and pulsates over its 10-minute running time. Hes moved away from proper and his sense of scope is more epic than ever. Cupids Head as a record just feels bigger, dwarfing his previous efforts.\nIn that sense, Cupids Head brings to mind another texture-focused album from this year: Fuck Buttons Slow Focus, which saw the Bristol noise duo reining in their noisy squall to focus on diamond-sharp textures and a greater attention towards small-scale detail. \"20 Seconds of Affection\", Cupids Heads gauzy closer, kicks things off with a throttling torrent of digital synth slush before giving way to a mid-tempo churn that continually folds itself into three-dimensional shapes, as a wandering bassline lurks just beneath the surface, wobbling with unease. \"Black Sea\" also has a feeling of up-up-up propulsion—hissing drum machines, interlocking tones, a swirl of transistor-radio noise lapping at the tracks feet—before dramatically changing shape in its back half, as menacing arpeggiated tones dominate. The Field project has typically projected easy warmth, a kind of synthesized benevolence, but the intensity of \"Black Sea\"s closing minutes is the darkest, most straightforwardly sensual, and most evil-sounding music Willners made.\nIndeed, Cupids Head is more intense than any other Field record. With the exception of the silvery guitar tones that open the albums epic opener, \"They Wont See Me\", these songs start at the top and stay there, eschewing patient build for pure relentlessness, a sonic persistence that obliterates everything around you in a comforting, head-clearing way.\nThere are many transcendent moments of bliss on Cupids Head—\"They Wont See Me\"s high-tension tonal axis, the squishy radiance of \"A Guided Tour\"—but \"No. No…\" is the albums greatest moment of awe, with an endlessly looped voices evocative of the Flamingos-warping abstraction of From Here We Go Sublimes title track. Each iteration of the title phrase gradually stretches it further into the void. Over a bed of stormy, amorphous rhythms and off-white static, the sampled voice changes shape—from high-pitched to low, staccato to elongated, specific to indefinable—until theres nothing left but a broken helicopter-blade beat and an unadorned vocal sample that vibrates with a menacing inflection. Its a wellspring of tension on an album that brims with paranoia.\nThe Fields discography is paradoxical. On the one hand, Cupids Head demonstrates how much Willners aesthetic has changed over the last six years. That those changes have been incremental, and that there are clear threads going back to his debut, highlight the singularity of what he does. The landscapes of dance and electronic music have shifted since the release of From Here We Go Sublime—minimal techno, as well as Willners label home Kompakt, have become niché concerns—so the fact that hes still an innovator in an always-crowded field is a considerable feat. A few artists have taken bits and pieces of his style and applied them in their own way, but no one has been able to sound like Willner, who in turn continues to sound like no one except himself. Cupids Head is a dark, exquisitely detailed album that rewards patience and further cements the Fields reputation as one of modern electronic musics most satisfying auteurs.",

        "article_text": "Danny Browns XXX was a concept album about desperation; \"If this shit dont work, nigga, I failed at life!\" he wailed on the opening song. Old is a concept album about existential confusion. Danny Brown has not failed at life—hes independently successful, with a fervent fan base both inside and out of rap. Now hes got to sort out how to best continue living. It might not be as dramatic a subject as flaming out, but its more relatable to most of us, and its maybe no accident that it resulted in the best and most resonant album of Browns career. \nIn preparing critics and fans, Brown went to great lengths to warn us not to expect another XXX—\"If people are just looking for dick-sucking jokes, there isnt too many of them,\" he said back in January. \"I listened to Old every day and thought, ‘I need to make this more entertaining,\" he told Pitchfork later. When I ran into him at SXSW and introduced myself, he gave me a quizzical smile: \"Im challenging yall with the next one,\" he joked, looking slightly uneasy. The irony of Old, of course, is that Danny Browns version of a sober, measured, mature album still features plenty of lines about snorting crushed pills, throwing up in hotel sinks, and smoking so much kush you feel yourself falling off of the earth. Some things havent changed. \nThe album is divided into a \"Side A\" and a \"Side B,\" an act of aesthetic devotion that signals Danny Browns unusual investment in the arcana of music fandom. Last year, he famously told a bewildered A$AP Rocky that one of his heroes was Arthur Lee before lecturing him on the merits of Forever Changes. The structure here suggests two LP sides, neatly divided, but one of the best things about Old is how mixed up it is—Browns past, his present, his deranged side, his reflective side, his party songs and his nightmares. \"Problems in my past haunt my future and the present,\" he moans on \"Clean Up\". The album is 19 songs, ranging across so much emotional terrain that it almost needs to be tackled in stretches. \nSide A contains the heaviest, most harrowing material, but the demons he exorcises there dont stay put. Bad memories pop up everywhere on Old, including the louder, more festival-ready second half. The albums structure pokes at the notion of forward motion: At the end of the first track, an unrelentingly ugly crack-sale reminiscence taking place in an abandoned house in Detroit, A-Trak scratches in a hook from \"New Era\", a song off of Browns 2010 release The Hybrid. An incident Brown alluded to on XXXs \"Fields\"—\"mommy gave me food stamps, told me buy some Wonderbread/ On the the way, these niggas jumped me, left with knots in my head\"—gets expanded to song-length on \"Wonderbread\" and then referenced again at the end of the album. The cumulative message is layered: 1) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because Ive been working double-time trying to escape him, and 2) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because hes obviously still here. \nThere are multiple \"old Danny Browns,\" as well: Theres the kid from \"Torture\", whose mind \"ticked off, desensitized to a lot of things\" after watching \"unk beatin on my auntie\" and a fiend \"damn near burn his top lip off.\" Theres the crack-dealer, who Brown is similarly eager to dispense with: \"This the last time Imma tell it/ Wanna hear it? Here it go,\" he says on \"Side B,\" before launching into the details of his old trade. And theres the drug abuser, whom he catalogs unsparingly on \"Clean Up\", ignoring text messages from his daughter while he gets high in a hotel room.\nThis is a complicated narrative to keep running but Brown is equal to the task. In his berserk originality, writerly flair, emotional impact, and old-fashioned craft, Danny Brown belongs in any conversation about the best rappers working, and hes at the top of his game here. His rapping is abrasive and visceral, but its also musical, a quality he doesnt get much credit for because of his vocal tone. Listen to the way he rolls the word sounds \"fucked up\" and \"knuckles\" on \"Dubstep\" off of a perfect little woodpecker-stutter of percussion. Or his subdued performance on \"Lonely\" featuring a fluid, airy beat by Paul White built from two Morice Benin samples.\nThe production is richly textured, unlikely, and surprising, solidifying Browns left-field taste. He bends your ear back rapping over conventionally gritty hip-hop tracks from Oh No and Paul White and tackles a range of things that most rappers would run from, including the Rustie-produced electro-squelch \"Way Up Here\", a cluttered, frantic beat that feels expressly designed to trip rappers up. Ab-Soul and Brown muscle the octopus-armed thing to the ground. He barks over airhorn-shrill party anthems like \"Dip\"and \"Handstand\" and broods conversationally on the Charli XCX-featuring \"Float On\". Brown has always made a compelling case for being weird, but hes never sounded this realized or confident in his weirdness before.\n\"Float On\", which closes the album, is an \"Elevators\"-like lope, complete with woodblock knock, that finds Brown clearing away the static and bearing down on the only thing hes certain about: \"Nothing else matter except my next rhyme,\" he murmurs. Remembering a time when he had \"music in my heart, but my thoughts wouldnt listen,\" he prays to get old so that he can \"see my influence on this genre of music.\" Its the humblest and most powerful wish Ive heard on a record all year.",

        "article_text": "Despite being the butt of jokes because of its goofy but actually spot-on name, chillwave as an idea and a sound is here to stay. Synthesizers are in; guitar-based rock has taken a backseat to diffuse, rhythmic dance music; and the sounds key influences (broken, blissed-out electronica, hip-hop) have leached into most interesting music happening right now.\nSo, where does a significant subgenre defined by the less-than-lofty goal of manufacturing good vibes go next? The artists either do the same thing with the same synth presets to diminishing returns (Memory Tapes, Small Black, Teen Daze) or they pull a Toro Y Moi on Underneath the Pine and morph into something different altogether. The former creates music that can seem a little too comfortable, and the latter, while admirable, could come over as a bit alarmist-- a calculated response to the critics.\nThe first full-length from Washed Out doesnt have an on-repeat banger like \"Feel It All Around\" on it, and it isnt a sea change. Instead its a sly, solid release that can fade into the background but has the ability to jump out and take hold of your ears. It sounds great on headphones and even better coming out of speakers in a car or at a party, where it can breathe a little. When Washed Outs Ernest Greene spoke to Pitchfork recently, he noted that he was working on the album in the same place that Goodie Mob were hammering out their reunion album. Quite different from the laptop on mom and dads back porch that birthed Life of Leisure.\nBen Allen, who helped beef up Animal Collectives sound for Merriweather Post Pavilion, produced the album, and while Within and Without isnt too shiny or expensive, the more professional approach rewards multiple listens. There are delicate, lasting production flourishes like the cracking snares on \"Echoes\" and the impenetrable web of fashion-show synths on \"Before\" that give way to an agitated disco-like jerk. Drums are bold and complex, reflecting the almost Pete Rock-aping found on Washed Outs tour-only Untitled EP, and live instruments are used for atmosphere the way samples were before. One of the most chilling, affecting moments of Within and Without happens when cello swings through \"Far Away\".\nThe albums also very sensual and not just because of the American Apparel-lite album cover. Its beats slink along like those Public Enemy drums creeping through Madonnas \"Justify My Love\", and theres a lush, snowy warmth to the production (one of the songs is even called \"Soft\"). No longer a stand-alone Adult Swim-released single, \"You And I\", featuring Chairlifts Caroline Polachek, is the soundtrack to a tender, Sunday morning make-out session, and well, just listen to that throbbing bassline. \"Sade but a bit more shy,\" or \"Trip-hop intended for making love rather than fucking\" kinda describes whats going on here. \"A Dedication\", the album ender, eschews airy ornate production for fragile piano and Greenes least mumbly, most direct vocal performance. Its a purposeful period at the end of the album; the point where the record stops worrying about dancing and seems intent to curl up and get cozy.\nWithin and Without is a declaration to snarky ironists that there is nothing to be ashamed of with this sound. \"Feel It All Around\", Neon Indians \"Should Have Taken Acid With You\", and Toro Y Mois \"Blessa\" entered this rarefied, awesome space between indie pop catchiness and fragile, narcotic groove, and heres a whole album of tracks on that level. That it comes at a time when others have abandoned the genre or quickly jumped on and then off to raise the stakes and get respectable, is even more impressive. Greene has made an elegant, subtle album in a genre that primarily values the single mp3 and, every once in a while, a 12\" or cassette tape. Within and Without is an excellent demonstration of what happens when, even after the buzz-band cycle has faded, you continue to investigate a sound on your own hushed, ambitious terms.",

        "article_text": "Its been 35 years since the release of UK folk singer Vashti Bunyans solo debut Just Another Diamond Day, which translates to roughly 240 years in music industry terms. And now, with the release of her second album Lookaftering, Bunyan has completed a comeback more reminiscent of pre-war country blues artists like Dock Boggs or Bukka White, whose performing and recording careers were resurrected during the 1960s folk revival, rather than anyone from the pop/rock era. Like those old folk and bluesmen, Bunyan returns to a musical landscape thats been unrecognizably altered. But unlike the later recordings of those performers-- which consisted primarily of reworking their older material-- Lookaftering represents the full-fledged reawakening of a still-vital talent, ready to cast aside her decades-long artistic hibernation and re-ignite her creative fires.\nAt that time, after the small initial pressing of Diamond Day failed to find an audience, a disheartened Bunyan left the city and music behind, packing her wagon to quietly raise children and animals in the Scottish Borders and rural Ireland. In the meantime, however, her album slowly built a reputation as a lost classic. So when Diamond Day was reissued in Britain to great acclaim in 2000, Bunyan commenced her gradual return to the spotlight. Since then shes made cameo appearances on albums by such fans as Devendra Banhart and Piano Magic, and earlier this year partnered with Animal Collective on the charming Prospect Hummer EP.\nOn Lookaftering, it comes as a relief to hear not only how pristine Bunyans delicate vocals remain but that she has retained her understated abilities as a songwriter, despite going decades without picking up a guitar. Taking its title from a self-invented word that refers to taking care of something or someone-- as well as to the process of looking back on the past-- Lookaftering deftly covers both these themes in ample measure. In many regards, this collection seems a wistful, measured reflection upon the long-ago daydreams of Diamond Day and the sweet sadness of all that goes by, while managing to retain the same tranquil, out-of-time intimacy that has allowed her debut to age so gracefully.\nLookaftering also features tasteful instrumental contributions from such guests as Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Mice Parades Adam Pierce, but Bunyans most crucial collaborator proves to be producer Max Richter. Throughout the album, Richters impeccable orchestrations of piano, strings, and woodwinds (co-arranged by Bunyan) masterfully echo Joe Boyds classic work with Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, and on Diamond Day; as well as Larry Fallons chamber-folk arrangements on Nicos Chelsea Girl. As with Diamond Day, this careful balance is critical to the albums success, since Vashtis feathery, near-whispered vocals could be easily capsized by a heavy-handed production.\n\"Indifference is the coldest hand/ It is the wave that clears the sand,\" sings Bunyan on \"Turning Backs\", an exquisitely orchestrated track she has said was written with Nick Drake in mind, but that might also provide insight into the reasons behind her long absence. Her frustration with the domestic life also crops up on \"Wayward\", on which she describes \"days going by lost in clouds of flour and whitewashing,\" before later sighing, \"I wanted to be the one with road-dust on my boots.\"\nElsewhere, though, these songs look on the past with a shivery, almost tangible longing. \"Here Before\", is an elegant ode to the happy mysteries of parenthood (\"Once I had a child/ He was wild in the moonlight/ He could do it all/ Like hed been here before\") while on \"Against the Sky\" she depicts a city-dweller nostalgic for her old farmstead (\"The hill behind the old house/ I can trace it with my finger.\") For some listeners, such nostalgia might teeter uncomfortably close to sentimentality, but even on personal tracks such as the brief elegy \"Brother\", Bunyan keeps her touch impossibly light, reflecting only for a moment before quickly turning another page. Lookaftering closes with a wordless reprise of \"Wayward\", as she quietly hums the songs melody as though unaware that anybody might be listening. But, hopefully, with the arrival at last of her stunning second album, Vashti Bunyan need no longer worry about her music going unheard.\n ",

        "article_text": "Even the best relationships acquire baggage. Circa 1999, Def Jux forged a fiefdom from the ashes of vinyl champs Fondle Em and the soon-to-be-ruined promise of Rawkus. \"Independent as fuck\" was the mantra, and for those wondering why MF Doom and the Roots couldnt get airplay, it may well have been a war cry.\nUntil Russell Simmons took a temporary sabbatical from model mongering to threaten a trademark-infringement lawsuit, even Def Juxs name riffed on (Darth) Def Jam, the rap overlord at its greased-up and growling Ruff Ryders, Jigga, and Ja Rule apex. But back when the \"Underground\" was tagged in capital letters, the promise of an alternate subterranean grid seemed infinite. Fat Beats did booming business. Hip-hop culture mags cropped up to survey the soundbombing. Clinton was President. Gas was $1 per gallon. A Bellevue-certified eccentric like Kool Keith could get Doctor Octagon dough from Dreamworks to squander in and around the West Hollywood IHOP.\nDuring that last spring of the 20th Century, Rawkus Records released Soundbombing II-- an Underground Now Thats What I Call Music!-- that banged incessantly in dorm rooms across America and England. It marked the first and only time Eminem and El-P shared space on wax. Yet it didnt feel that weird at the time. People still used the phrase \"on wax\" and Shady had only recently signed to Interscope. To balance his quality time with Dr. Dre, Marshall Mathers also worked with people like Thirstin Howl III and Outsidaz. As the demented fan from \"Stan\" said: \"I like that shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat.\" Not only did people still use the word \"phat,\" they opted to build clothing lines around it.\nYou can trace the genesis of El-Ps solo career back to Soundbombing IIs \"Patriotism\". A five-minute fulguration to American culture and the military-industrial complex, it was credited to Company Flow, but his one-time rhyme partner Bigg Jus sat on the sidelines. The next year, the group released its final single, \"DPA\". It was the second release on the fledgling Def Jux and doubled as a mission statement. This is \"heart of darkness,\" El-P fulminated and as if to prove his point, George W. Bush \"won\" the Electoral College several months later. He may have been referencing Joseph Conrad, but the Brooklyn bomber soon received a bête noire worthy of Richard Nixon and Raoul Duke. The new imprint existed to chronicle the fear and loathing. And by 2007s Ill Sleep When Youre Dead, he confessed to \"a gonzomatic fear turning [him] Hunter S. Thompson.\"\nAt least that was the image that took root. The reality was more and less sophisticated. Bizarro attempts to break the mold with funk-fusionists Chin Chin and the original Lonely Island, Party Fun Action Committee, rarely received the attention they deserved. Nor did the mutant howls of Camu Tao, whose genre-clobbering experimentation influenced Kid Cudi, Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire, and Danny Brown. Luck didnt lend itself to the Def Jux enterprise. Rjd2 could have re-made Deadringer a half-dozen times, and both label and artist could have reaped that soccer mom Moby licensing money. Instead, he ditched turntables for the microphone, signed to XL, and offered prayers to the mustache of John Oates. Meanwhile, meal tickets Cannibal Ox couldnt get it together for a sophomore album and were last seen wandering lost around the Gardens of Asgard.\nThats a lot to deal with for any label head, let alone one tasked to redesign the Delorean every five years. Its hard enough to rap and make beats professionally, never mind having to worry about C-Rayz Walz wanting help with his 401(k). Factor in the ravages of online piracy and the tragic death of Camu Tao, and bombing the system seemed like the only obvious option. Yet what mightve been most damning was that Def Jux became imprisoned by ideals that belonged to a different era. Even if most of their artists had long outgrown the \"Us vs. Them\" mentality, outside perception didnt always chart the progression.\nBy now, Eminem was making 12-step anthems for trailer trash. Soundbombing II star Common was allowed to wear angora and cinematically woo Queen Latifah with his low-post moves. But El-P and by proxy Definitive Jux were stereotyped with opinions like the one A$AP Worldwide co-founder Yams offered earlier this year: Company Flow fans dont buy A$AP Rocky records. Maybe that was true 10 years ago (if A$AP Rocky been out of Junior High), but the truth had become closer to El-Ps response: Im in Company Flow and I listen to A$AP. It was the rap equivalent of the Battle of New Orleans. The cease-fire had been signed, but there was one last conflict before putting the era to sleep.\nWith the exception of the Jay-Z/Kanye/Young Money/Rozay axis, the rap game has largely flattened out (or bottomed out, depending on your angle). A guy like Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire can get a deal from Universal after releasing a free mixtape over old Necro and El-P beats. Waka Flocka fronts this months XXL, but Killer Mike and El-P get second billing alongside Chief Keef, Curren$y, and Slaughterhouse. 2Chainz is playing Rock the Bells. Things are more similar than theyve seemed in a long time.\nCancer 4 Cure is both reinvention and inversion. El-Ps first album since putting Def Jux on hiatus in early 2010 marks a break from the old order and another call to arms. Whereas Fantastic Damage served as a Def Jux coming out party and Ill Sleep When Youre Dead synthesized the sweaty jitters of the mid-Dubya daze, Cancer 4 Cure consciously creates its own iron galaxy. None of the Def Jukies appear, save for Despot. In their stead are eXquire, Danny Brown, and a snarling Killer Mike, whose El-P produced R.A.P. Music is already the front-runner for rap album of the year. Any one of their guest spots could be a hip-hop quotable, if we still lived at a time when people cared about the Hip Hop Quotable. But my vote goes to Danny Brown, self-described as \"Ric Flair/ With thick hair/ Yelling out woo/ Getting head in the directors chair.\"\nCancer 4 Cures closest analogue may be Portisheads Third: the textures and tones are distinctly different from past releases, but its unimaginable that it could be made by anyone else. El-P has described the record as fight music abstracted. To be more specific, its fight or flight music. Primal response mechanism rap. And like any good storyteller, his narratives are rooted in conflict. On \"Tougher Colder Killer\", El-P inhabits the mindset of a soldier haunted by post-traumatic stress, who made \"his enemy dig his own grave at the point of a gun.\" \"For My Upstairs Neighbor\" finds the protagonist getting grilled by cops about a domestic violence situation in his apartment building. He tells \"Columbo\" nothing, but later confronts the abuse victim in the stairwell and whispers to her, \"do the thing you have to and I swear Ill tell them nothing.\" Meanwhile, \"Works Every Time\" is a drug dealer dialectic between the urge to self-medicate and the consequences of the obliteration.\nThe closest thing the record has to a love song is \"The Jig Is Up\", where the hook uses the words of Groucho Marx to describe a relationship: \"I wouldnt want to be a part of any club that would have me.\" Even \"Sign Here\", a song grappling with sexual power issues uses an interrogation room as a metaphorical backdrop. You dont need me tell you that its heavy. Its a record from El-P, a man who could make Pollyanna see poltergeists. But to balance out the hangmans tension, theres \"Drones over BKLYN\" and \"The Full Retard\", two clavicle-cracking rants reminiscent of the old El-P, with rhymes \"short and fat like Joe Pesci\" that would \"slap you out of your fucking shit.\"\nThe beats. The synths sound like theyve been stolen from a bargain bin on Alpha Centauri, stocked with futuristic workout anthems for robot soldiers. Listening to it in daylight hours can make you feel allergic to sunlight. Most rumble at 130 to 140 BPM and feel uniquely congruent with and ahead of the times. After all, the producers at L.A.s Low End Theory and the early London dubstep architects all owe a small but significant debt to Els experiments with negative space and bone-chipping bass.\nWhat grounds the record is a scarcely subliminated obsession with death. Dedicated to Camu Tao, whose demise directly preceded its creation, the characters are forever warring with some imminent end, whether creative, romantic, or literal. Its rare when re-inventions seem so deliberate but unselfconscious. And through the struggle it gains a certain scarred freedom. Its simultaneously able to stand alone but alongside that trademark blend of sneering New York City skepticism. It sheds the bullshit of the past and is stained with the weary residue of an incalculable number of cigarettes, weed deliveries, bodega runs, and blind turns. Its the best kind of tribute El-P could make: a record that you can pump like they do in the future.",

        "article_text": "It used to take ages for underground sounds to find their way into mainstream pop music. Information moved more slowly, recordings took more time to produce, and there were layers of cultural gatekeepers to be navigated in the process, so subcultures that craved obscurity could usually find it. The internet and digital recording technology have changed that. Now, if your timing’s right, you can see a specific synth sound or drum programming technique make its way from some nobody producer’s SoundCloud page to pop radio in maybe a couple of months, but sometimes in just weeks.\nThe shadowy postdubstep underground bass music scene, for instance, is currently finding itself thrust into the spotlight by Kanye, Drake, and their legions of followers whove adopted increasingly dark-toned aesthetic identities informed by artists like SBTRKT and Arca. This scrutiny and appropriation will only intensify in the wake of Lorde’s Pure Heroine, which transmuted minimalist bass music that wouldve qualified as avant garde only a few months ago into chart gold. So what does a musical community with a preference for operating under the pop-cultural radar do when mainstream artists start knocking it off for parts? The smartest and most productive thing would be to launch its own competing, alternative product: And now it has, in the form of Kelela Mizanekristos.\nRaised in the Maryland suburbs around D.C. on a diet of 1990s pop-R\u0026B divas before relocating to the bustling L.A. bass scene, Kelela is attempting to do what dozens of top-tier singers, songwriters, and producers are also trying, which is to take the moody sounds of the sorts of electronic musicians orbiting club nights/labels/collectives like Night Slugs and Fade to Mind, and give them a more pop-friendly spin that will appeal to listeners who don’t normally go in for severely dark dance music.\nUnlike other singers working at similar aims, Kelela is tight enough with the Fade to Mind/Night Slugs crews to collaborate with them directly, so her beats come straight from the source: Bok Bok, Nguzunguzu, Girl Unit, FtM founder Kingdom, and other affiliated artists who’ve helped define a booming, severely stripped-down sound pieced together from bits of techno, grime, R\u0026B, drum \u0026 bass, and dubstep’s pre-neon days. It’s well-constructed launchpad that she’s acquired for herself, and she doesn’t waste it.\nCut 4 Me is an ambitiously catchy record as well as being an aesthetically ambitious one. Essential to this is Kelela’s decision to play against the beats moodiness—that juxtaposition drives the album’s likability. The beat by NA for “Do It Again” is horror-movie creepy, with a hypnotic John Carpenter-like keyboard figure looping over booming haunted house drums, which she decided to use as the foundation for an slow-motion sex jam straight out of the Aaliyah playbook. The Nguzunguzu-produced “Enemy” is as twitchily abrasive as the most staunchly underground first-wave dubstep, so she tops it with a cotton-candy pop-R\u0026B vocal that could have been lifted from a turn of the millennium Brandy B-side.\nKelela’s an unlikely diva for a scene that’s attracted more than its share of dance music purists who don’t go in for frippery like vocalists, but it works. She also needs to close some of the gap between her ambition and what her voice is capable of—it’s a perfectly good voice, but lacks much of the expressiveness and power that singers who don’t come by those things naturally need time to develop. But this kind of works, too. A full-blast diva would obliterate the subtlety that the beats rely on, and the spunky-newcomer charisma that her performance projects imparts crucial warmth to their icy sounds.\nThe voice can be worked on, though. The more important things that Cut 4 Me teaches us about Kelela are that she has the taste to pick out a fantasy all-star team of collaborators, the talent to make herself heard over their beats, and the intelligence to get it all together at the exact right moment. That’s all instinct, and that can’t be learned. If she wants pop stardom—if not the five-star kind like Rihanna, then at least the cultishly-adored kind like her former tourmate Solange—she couldn’t be in a better place.",

        "article_text": "As the Wolf Parade juggernaut gathers steam, the quintets charismatic keyboardist, Spencer Krug, somehow found time to follow his recent self-titled Sunset Rubdown EP with Shut Up I Am Dreaming, a collection of his strongest, most fully realized non-Wolf Parade material to date. Over the course of just one year, Sunset Rubdowns progressed from Snakes Got a Legs rickety and insular lo-fi basement tape sound to a fuller-bodied EP to this exceedingly well-dressed, multi-hued glam pop.\nNow operating as a full band (here, a quartet), Sunset Rubdown more closely resemble Wolf Parade but still maintain the rougher ragtag sound of their previous recordings. A good example is triumphal opener \"Stadiums and Shrines II\", which continues the practice of updating Krugs songs and echoing his past catalogue (all while building a personal cosmology). This version includes the same lyrics and general melody as the scrubbier slip-n-slide on Snakes Got a Leg, but otherwise its an entirely different monster. Krug sheds the off-kilter dust-bowl harmonium and stuttering underwater feel of the original for a cleaner, less warped anthem. Now, when he sings \"theres a kid in there/ And hes big and dumb/ And hes...kinda scared,\" instead of going by unnoticed, itll make you lose your breath.\nIn his more fleshed-out, metaphysically epic form, Krug consistently finds ways to yoke disparate parts; theres so much inventive stitching, in fact, it makes it tempting to offer a play-by-play with color commentary for every song. Beyond writing catchy tunes and packing them with whispers, mallets, harpsichord, and patches of cheapskate drum machines, hes an intriguing presence. Instead of bubbling along at one level, he roller coasters and raves, mixing nonsense with sharp observations and sadness with puns. This jam-packed, unbridled sound ought to heighten the Frog Eyes comparisons, but complicated by the groups shared tour and Krugs former role as one of Carey Mercers band members, that contrast is a bit of a bore. Besides, Krug doesnt stick to any particular style beyond his approach to his howls.\nMore interesting to note: The cumulative effect of Shut Up I Am Dreaming surpasses \"Ill Believe in Anything\"s ostensible perfection. Thats a brilliant song, yes, but this a brilliant album, ballooning with those sorts of moments on repeat. See, for instance, the speedy ragtime re-versioning of \"Snakes Got a Leg III\", which feels comparable to Wolf Parades \"Dears Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts\"-- albeit with a scrubby sense of pathos-- or jaunty sawdust kicker \"They Took a Vote and Said No\". As in many of Krugs songs, there seems to be some sort of moral, as if hes writing warped and warbling Aesop Fables. Here, its \"a kid\" who \"wants a ride\", learning that nothing comes for free and \"there are things that have to die so other things can stay alive.\" Some fleet-fingered guitar work and crashing drums obscure the lesson; after a pause and piano line, were handed a kick-ass axe-toting coda.\nThen theres the piano-based ballad \"Us Ones in Between\", on which he pulls out his deck of unexpected metaphors woven with an endlessly ambient tone-generating guitar: \"You are a waterfall/ Wading inside a well/ And you are a wrecking ball/ Before the building fell.\" Again, theres one of those tenderly surrealistic morals: \"Ive heard of creatures who eat their babies/ I wonder if they stop to think about the taste.\" Through an inversion, Krug himself becomes the creature as well as the eaten, asking, \"Oh baby, mother me before you eat me.\" In other new turns, there are female backing vocals provided by former Pony Up! member Camilla Wynne Ingr, and on many tracks glockenspiel or xylophone tap a ringing background.\nThe opening piano tingle of \"Swimming\" churns into haunted-house circus music and then it bursts and blooms into the catchiest little music-box reprise of \"The Dust You Kick Up Is Too Fine\" from the debut. These echoes are everywhere, the resampling a weirdly pleasant and satisfying sort of minimalism, offering listeners a chance to see his work from various angles.\nThis is rich stuff and it wont be surprising if some listeners prefer Krugs maniacal flights of fancy to Apologies to the Queen Marys sense of balance. Theres obviously much to be said for Wolf Parades addictive push/pull switch hitting-- that overflowing seep between Bowie/Eno and jittery Iggy/Springsteen-- but its also incredibly fun watching pop songs pulled apart and restitched into tiny rococo monuments and tossed skyward. All the Wolf Parade comparisons are a drag, sorry, but theyre inevitable. Plus, the contexts important: Because Krug followed some of the best material on Apologies with this elegant wallop, hes looking increasingly like an important songwriter rather than just another flavor-of-the-month.\n ",

        "article_text": "Jace Clayton (aka DJ/rupture) inspires a special tenor of admiration from music critics because, in addition to crafting literate, reference-rich, and conversational music, he often writes about it just as adeptly. Its not a stretch, if were honest, to say that he writes about music more skillfully and illuminatingly than the majority of us who have ever done it full-time. He is, to put it bluntly, one of those people who gets it right far more often and in more different ways than your ordinary person really should. Uproot is another one of those instances.\nIn the broadest, most literal sense, Rupture came to rise as a mashup artist, and there are certainly elements of Uproot-- a mix following on the turrets of 2002s Gold Teeth Thief and Minesweeper Suite and 2005s Low Income Tomorrowland-- that find him flexing those muscles. To give him that tag, though, would be a bit misleading; Rupture uses the form to different ends. Folks like Girl Talk, Diplo, and A-Trak use mashups to make superficial connections, or to make people dance, or to be clever, or, sometimes, to be clever-clever. Rupture, as the name implies, creates fissures. Hes less likely to rip four bars or a hooky lyric from something as he is to extract its mood in total; hes less interested in creating fleeting moments than he is in creating large, interweaving tapestries. Because his source material is generally pulled from dubstep, ragga, outré hip-hop, found sounds, and other indigenous musics, those tapestries can often sound political. Clayton has such a global, democratic ear and such a knack for soupy unease that its difficult not to hear his mixes, at least partly, as commentary pieces. Even when, as is the case with Uproot, his mixes veer on the neatly manicured side, they still ultimately feel combustible out of the box.\nWhile Uproot feels every bit as purposeful as those earlier mixes, it achieves that goal though different means. Musically, its far more subdued and spacious; the lacerating swathes of digital noise have been subbed out for tracks that favor lonely, clattering rhythms, yawning sub-basslines, and displaced vocals. Like a lot of his contemporaries, Rupture has clearly gravitated towards dubstep over the past few years, and Uproot shows his selection skills in that space are as impeccable as they are elsewhere. From the cavernous glissandos in Frescoes \"Afghanistan\" to the twerky, demodulated keys in Filastines \"Hungry Ghost (Instrumental)\" to the haunted illbient fog of Moving Ninjas \"Uranium\", Claytons selections are generous and far-reaching, and build a pretty compelling case for dubstep as the most creatively robust genre in electronic music right now.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Uproot also features moments of genuine, unfettered softness and beauty. Atki2s \"Winter Buds\" is a dubstep rhythm that rests on an expected rush of warm piano chords, while Dead Leafs \"Save From the Flames All That Yet Remains\" chases the looping, pulsing ambient of Professor Shehab + Lloops \"Drunken Monkey (Ambient Remix)\" with a gentle swell of strings and pianos. Most notable, though, is the 1-2 punch that provides the mixs stirring midway point; a bittersweet interlude from cellist and Clayton collaborator Jenny Jones provides the segue into a few minutes from the second of Ekkehard Ehlers terrific two-part ode to filmmaker John Cassavetes, from his 2002 album Plays. Although roundly earmarked as special by the relative few who heard it upon its release, history has arguably done \"Plays John Cassavetes\" a disservice. Claytons resurrection of it here, in turn, speaks to another key reason his mixes are special; hes in the rare category of DJs who gives the impression that he is not just wading through music, but correcting it by building his own canon, and constructing an alternate history. Its a place you would want to live.",

        "article_text": "Im loathe to call any album a summation of an artists career-- that reeks of lazy criticism-- but Songs in A\u0026E is certainly Spiritualizeds best work in 10 years. All of Jason Pierces fascinations of the past 20-plus years appear here-- well get to em soon enough-- in a truly syncretic, muted, and beautiful way. And theres something rooted and grounded about Songs in A\u0026E. Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in place.\nThis is Pierces first record in five years-- the delay was, in part, due to him being hospitalized with double pneumonia, i.e. he was really fucked-up and tethered to machines to keep him alive. (In the UK, the ER is called the Accident \u0026 Emergency ward-- hence the title.) Not surprisingly, Pierces ordeal colors the sound and tone of the record-- \"Death Take Your Fiddle\", essentially another update of the traditional \"O Death\", seems to sample the sound of a respirator-- although Pierce has stated in interviews that the album was already more than half-finished when he took ill.\nLyrically, as Pierce as wont to do, there are love songs, drug songs, and God songs-- typically, theyre all those things at once at times. Pierces protagonist on these tunes is world-weary (\"So hard to fight when youre losing/ I got a little fire in my soul,\" he says on \"I Gotta Fire\") and sounds all the more so in Pierces lovely croaking/cracking vocals. What saves the songs from woe-is-me solipsism and overarching sentimentality is a well-hidden but ironic sense of humor. Well, that and the fact that the music itself is awesome. The key song is \"Borrowed Your Gun\", which begins like a typical junkie lament with \"Daddy Im sorry\" but continues into murder ballad territory with \"I borrowed your gun again/ Shot up your family.\"\nA few songs on Songs in A\u0026E run on a bit too long-- this is a Spiritualized record, after all-- and from some angles a few arrangements can sound hokey. The big rocker \"I Gotta Fire\" is like the Stone Roses covering Sonic Youths \"Bull in the Heather\", but even on lesser tracks, a delightful oboe or a crazy lyric or a swelling gospel chorus swoops in and gives you a reason to replay the track. Pierce is again walking mopey, orchestral, minimalist rock out to the margins of taste and messing with your head all over the place. And this time he does it with a shit-ton of sonic subtlety. (Take those earbuds out and pop this one on the stereo.)\nPierce has never seemed so in control of his aesthetic, rather than controlled by it like some sort of drone-rock fetishist. The props dropped here are super obvious, and meant to be so, whether to Daniel Johnston with the \"Funeral Home\" refrain or to Kris Kristofferson with a quotation from \"Me \u0026 Bobby McGee\". Prior releases each had enjoyable but indulgent bliss-out tracks that went on a long time, but on A\u0026E the out sounds are distilled into six miniature numbered tracks each called \"Harmony\". These serve as a glue holding the album together, and while theyre \"spacey,\" their brevity keeps the record on solid terrestrial ground. The other songs are vessels for contrasting ideas: la-la melodies vs. wah-wah guitar, strings vs. brass, country licks vs. Free Design-style vocals, and simple structures vs. lush arrangements. These oppositional concepts overlap more than ever on A\u0026E, but the album only sounds muddled or muddied during a few clunky transitions. And weirdly, those serve to make you more aware than ever of the greatness of what hes doing the rest of the time.",

        "article_text": "John Maus first gained notice while collaborating and playing with fellow Cal Arts classmate Ariel Pink more than 10 years ago. Though both have since developed cultish followings by releasing distinctive takes on murky lo-fi, Maus has steeped his music in new wave signifiers, an association furthered by his deep, commanding voice. Whether hes evoking Joy Divisions Ian Curtis or Bauhaus Peter Murphy, Maus opts to abstract the genre, inserting noise into unexpected places and walking the line between sincerity and surreality.\nFrom the beginning, hes been an artist fascinated by the parameters, paradoxes, and possibilities of pop. Earlier this year, Maus took a walk through New Yorks Central Park Zoo with a journalist from Self-Titled. \"I didnt realize that the music I was making was especially weird,\" he says in the piece. \"Honestly, I thought I was making Top 40 kind of stuff. It wasnt until people kept telling me so that I realized my work was thought of as something other than that.\" If youre at all familiar with the Minnesota natives swampy retro-futurist synth-pop, you may understand why he might place emphasis on the word \"other.\" One experience with his body of solo work (or brave live performances) makes clear that his could be categorized as \"outsider\" art, but its difficult to say that without also seriously considering why. He makes thought-provoking music thats disguised as something else.\nWe Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves, his latest full-length, is the most vibrant and toothsome expression of Maus pursuits yet. He keeps his vocals awash in gothic reverb and echo-driven effects, blurring the lines between what hes saying and emoting. Sometimes, as on \"Cop Killer\", a Jan Hammer-indebted number on which Maus sings over an iced bed of keys, the results are outlandish and oddly funny at the same time, in the way that certain scenes in David Lynch films can leap from chilling to comically exaggerated. (\"Cop killer, lets kill the cops tonight/ Cop Killer, kill every cop in sight,\" he sings.) And then theres \"Matter of Fact\" immediately thereafter, a song whose staccato, orc-like chorus line is \"Pussy is not a matter of fact.\" Theyre not the kind of earworms you want to find yourself singing aloud in public, but it might happen anyway.\nSonically, Maus works a minimal, primitive setup: sputtering drum machines and an arsenal of 1980s-vintage synth presets undercut his lyrics just as much as those exaggerated, often grotesque vocal turns do. Sometimes, these songs seem to exist solely to pose questions: Top 40 cheese or ironic cool? High-brow or low-brow? Honesty or posturing? Artifice or reality? But what makes We Must Become his finest full-length yet is how fluidly he communicates it all by foregrounding melody. On \"Keep Pushing On\", Maus monastic, cellar-level singing lends the song the feel of a Gregorian chant-led exercise tape. Though the vocals and basslines on arpeggiated fever dream \"Quantum Leap\" mirror Joy Divisions to an almost cartoonish degree, you still get a good sense of Maus persona in the music. Theres a genuine, almost maniacal sense of glee in the way he seems to approach each turn.\nWhen Maus takes the stage, he plays with notions of performance by singing over his own backing tracks. He pogos, he screams, he runs-in-place and pulls his hair and spits and sweats and clenches up until he looks like he might burst through his button-down and chinos. Its hard to look away. Now Maus has a full set of songs whose architecture is just as sophisticated and riveting in actuality as it is in theory. While earlier records have been riddled by experiments gone awry (see: \"Rights for Gays\" and \"Tenebrae\", from 2007s Love Is Real), they also didnt feature the revolving parts and aerodynamic hooks of \"Believer\", the closing track here and one that glitters from any angle. And although theres another vocalist at his side in the lullaby lilt of \"Hey Moon\" (songwriter Molly Nilsson, who wrote and performed the song on her 2008 album These Things Take Time), the way Maus sings to the heavens makes it sound as though hes no longer alone with his thoughts. Spend a lot of time with this record, and its hard not to feel like youre right there with him.",

        "article_text": "Forget disco for a second. The most significant thing about the debut album from New Yorks Hercules and Love Affair has less to do with revival than arrival-- that of a compelling new voice in American dance music. Not Antony Hegartys, of Antony and the Johnsons, even though his pipes are an integral part of Hercules aesthetic, but Andrew Butler, a twentysomething resident of New York who has made one of 2008s great albums, and one of the best longplayers from DFA. (DFAs Tim Goldsworthy surely deserves some of the credit as well, as the albums co-producer and the programmer behind most of the records beats.) Butler got his start writing music for art projects in college-- \"like a remake of Gino Soccios Runaway done in the style of Kraftwerk,\" he told Fact magazine-- but Hercules and Love Affairs music doesnt require Fischerspooner-type theatrics. This debut album is a self-contained, self-assured, 10-song set that runs vintage styles through a restless compositional imagination to create something joyfully, startlingly unique.\nOf course, you cant entirely forget about disco; the record owes a debt to the dance-music of the 1970s and 80s, from Gamble \u0026 Huff-style strings to the camp sensibilities of Sylvester or Patrick Cowley. Butler has clearly studied Arthur Russell: His dancefloor jams have the same energy that drives uptempo Russell numbers like \"Go Bang\" and \"Is It All Over My Face?\", and his arrangements-- as when he nestles Kim Ann Foxmans voice in a bed of spongy keys and bass on \"Athene\", like an Easter egg in plastic grass-- recall Russells facility for space and timbre.\nThere are plenty of signposts for disco, the genre: octave-toggling bass lines (played by Automatos Andrew Raposo and !!!s Tyler Pope), rattling congas, bouncing 4/4 kicks, and insistent open hi-hats. There are references to house, as well, as would be expected from a record whose lead single features a Frankie Knuckles remix. But they point less to the 90s version of house as a distinct genre, whether sleek and lush or raw and machinic, than to house music in its origins, when it was simply disco music that was played at the Warehouse. Only \"You Belong\", with its taut, spiky drum machine programming and pistoning chords, engages the formalism of early Chicago house.\nAnd it engages it brilliantly. What is often forgotten when talking about music so steeped in tradition is how it actually sounds-- how it works, how it conjures. It would be a shame if Hercules and Love Affairs music were to be reduced to the sum of its references, even in shorthand, because Butlers music is too complex, too lovingly stuffed with ideas. That Hercules and Love Affair is as unwieldy as its name-- and also just as passionate, camp, and muscular-- is one of its great pleasures. \"You Belong\" begins as a faithful exercise in acid-house revivalism, from the syncopated cowbell patterns to a looped vocal sample recalling the classic house invocations to \"Jack, motherfucker.\" (It doesnt matter that the indistinct sample says something different; its cadence triggers something like an unconscious memory of acid houses vocal tropes.) Its the way that Butler and his collaborators mold formalist fidelity into something stranger that makes the track really sing, beginning with keyboards that seem to float on a cushion of air, and extending to the way that the singer Nomis lead vocals are mimicked by a multitracked backing refrain from Antony that sounds as though its been run through a prism. For its minor-key structure, the songs augmented chords give it the quality of an exploding rainbow.\nNot everything here is designed as \"dance music.\" The opening \"Time Will\", one of the albums highlights, mutates a standard disco framework into a weird and gelatinous torch song. \"Iris\", likewise, slows house musics pitter-patter dramatically, leaving the rhythm a framing device for the interplay between horns, synthesizers, and Foxmans sentimental lead vocals. And \"Easy\", the albums most understated song, sounds so different from the rest of the record that it suggests an alternate trajectory Hercules and Love Affair could presumably pursue-- a dusky noir somewhere between the Knife and Shriekback.\nBut while more than half of the albums tracks would easily work on forward-thinking dance floors-- \"Hercules Theme\", \"You Belong\", \"Athene\", \"Blind\", \"This Is My Love\", \"Raise Me Up\", and \"True False, Fake Real\" all cruise comfortably between 110 and 120 bpm-- what really shines is the songwriting. The album brims with hooks, choruses, bridges, strange twists, and turns. Its hardly maximalist-- every song feels like it could be played by a four-or-five piece band with a few overdubs-- and yet the record expands and contracts, pressing tones together before zooming outward to present each element in stark, shining relief. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the rollicking \"Hercules Theme\", which opens with a spare loop of percussion, Rhodes, and electric bass and gradually balloons into a soaring mess of horns, string vamps, and vocal harmonies. Few producers can pull off excess as well as Butler and Goldsworthy; that they balance their outré tendencies with moments of careful restraint only confirms their finesse.\nIf the record has a flaw, it might be its overall pacing. \"Time Will\" and \"Hercules Theme\" feel like theyre vying for the opening slot, a sense confirmed by the fact that theyre in the same key. And the flow of the records latter half feels off, with the subdued \"Iris\" and \"Easy\" followed by another muted disco number (\"This Is My Love\") before jumping back into the jaunty \"Raise Me Up\" and \"True False, \"Fake Real\". But these are quibbles. Hercules and Love Affair is a phenomenal album, one destined to save disco not from its detractors but rather from those fans and revivalists who would calcify the music as a set as a set of tropes and reference points. Lush, melancholic, gregarious, generous, both precise and a little bit unhinged-- this is the most original American dance album in a long while.",

        "article_text": "Baltimore is as musically diverse as anywhere else, but in 2008, indie rockers associate the city with colorful, energetic music, from the expatriated Animal Collective to Dan Deacons Wham City crew. The music of Beach House, the Baltimore-based duo of multi-instrumentalist Alex Scally and vocalist/organist Victoria Legrand, is a shadow narrative running parallel to this trend: Their delicate, lovelorn pop comes in the form of deathly waltzes and dark pastoral dirges on which Legrand sings about desire, loss, and dreams as if telling a ghost story, splitting the difference between lovely and creepy.\nFor pristine pop, Beach Houses self-titled 2006 debut was awfully raw: Legrand downplayed her classical piano and voice training in a humble negation of virtuosity. The organs sounded like something thick and coarse being pulled through a small, jagged opening; chord structures were simply suggestions; imperfections were kept intact. That balance of beauty and imprecision made inspired songs like \"Saltwater\", \"Tokyo Witch\", \"Apple Orchard\", and \"Master of None\" easy to fall in love with.\nThe duos songwriting hasnt fundamentally changed on Devotion; theyve simply cleaned up their act. These are crisper, brighter, bolder songs, retaining Beach Houses sense of elegant decay while sweeping up the debris. \"Gila\" is a funeral on a sunny day; its shimmering organs are controlled, never bleeding chaotically as they did on the debut, and are complemented by frilly but steadfast guitar. \"Turtle Island\" reaffirms Beach Houses preference for simple, skeletal percussion, but its dense melody is a marked advancement. The result of this pre-spring cleaning is that Devotion lacks some of the immediate highs of the first album-- you no longer get the sense of rooting for an embattled underdog-- but winds up consistently stronger.\nEven though its tidier and more streamlined, the music surrenders none of its autumnal charm, and theres still a sense of eavesdropping on a private, ongoing dialogue between Legrand and a ghost. Of course, we only get to hear her side of the story. As on the first album, which began with the words \"Love you all the time, even though youre not mine,\" she favors second-person assertions that speak of self-effacement, dependence, and sinister dream-world conversations. \"Your wish is my command,\" she intones on \"Wedding Bell\", becoming a genie in a puff of smoke. And on \"Gila\", she sings in a world-weary wheeze, \"Man, youve got a lot of jokes to tell.\" But instead of the punch line, we get the sort of jarring shift that characterizes dreams: \"So you throw your babys banners down the well.\"\n\"Invite your sister into the garden,\" she drones on the wind-up waltz \"You Came to Me\", concurrently inviting us into the murky depths of her romantic consciousness. Theres a sense of latent danger in the invitation, like a siren song luring us toward sharp clusters of rock. Portals into mysterious spaces pockmark Devotion; none of them promise a way out. Perhaps this explains why an album that takes its title and concept from a superficially sweet concept has such a subtle bite: Legrands devotion is a dungeon into which she tosses her own desires like coins into a wishing well, a one-way conduit from which only echoes return.",

        "article_text": "Can an album really be a departure if its the first thing a groups released in 11 years? It ideally would be for a genre-bound band turned brand name like Portishead: As much as there is to miss about the mid-late 1990s, the time for any trip-hop revival is far into the future, and picking up right where they left off in 1997 would make Portishead some kind of sad cipher coasting on the fumes of an exhausted trend-- something theyve always been above. If the voice of Beth Gibbons wasnt so ingrained in the consciousness of a whole generation of indie kids, you could look at Third as a sort of re-debut; it posits that the sound of Portishead can actually exist even after the group excises every possible remnant of trip-hop from it.\nAs radical reinventions go, Third is surprisingly natural. You can credit Gibbons as the familiarizing factor: She possesses a voice that seems impossible to shackle to just one musical setting, even if it already sounds perfectly at home in brooding downtempo ambience. As the most recognizable component of the group, she has the most established stylistic tendencies-- subtle quivers, an ability to go from hushed to piercing without laboring over the transition, an aching timbre that expresses anxious vulnerability better than nearly any other singer-- and she slips back into them comfortably when she needs to.\nBut its also a style that works in more contexts than weve previously heard, something she hinted at with Rustin Man on 2002s folk and jazz-influenced Out of Season, and Third is the culmination of this. Pitted against the jarring mechanical stop-starts of first single \"Machine Gun\" or the chase-scene-paced opener \"Silence\", Gibbons sounds like both a defiant accuser and someone clinging on for dear life. Quieter numbers, like the slow-build electronic ballad \"The Rip\" or the softer moments of the cabaret highwire act \"Hunter\", highlight the fragility in her voice. And since almost every song on Third addresses some sort of emotional or mental helplessness-- typically a deep and profound sense of loss and isolation-- its almost as though this shift in sonic identity is there to mask the fact that this is an incredibly bleak record lyrically. Gibbons wounded tone can take commonplace-on-paper sentiments (\"Id like to laugh at what you said but I just cant find a smile\"; \"I cant deny what Ive become/ Im just emotionally undone\") and give them a kind of pathos thats almost uncomfortably voyeuristic to listen to.\nAs for how the music itself has changed, long story short: Third is a psychedelic rock album. It opens with a rhythm thats nearly twice as fast as almost everything else Portishead have done, the percussion on most of the songs is frequently muffled or buried under layers of noise and sometimes just stops short of being non-existent (though its heavy and propulsive when it does make itself known), and their keyboards and strings have graduated from relaxed tension into dissonant rumbles and shrieks. Theres a brief acoustic folk song (\"Deep Water\"), an abrasive and jittery electro-industrial number (\"Machine Gun\"), free jazz horns (\"Magic Doors\"), analog freakouts from the United States of America-fueled early days of electronic psych (\"The Rip\"), and a song that sounds a bit like Clinics droning, rhythmically dense garage-kraut, except somehow spookier (\"We Carry On\"). Portishead as you previously knew them are represented, barely, by the last song on the album-- the sleepwalk-paced, David Axelrod-esque \"Threads\"-- and even then, its intermittently fuzzed-out tension-and-release dynamic wouldve made it one of the harshest-sounding songs on Dummy or Portishead.\nYou could say that this would be unrecognizable as a Portishead album without Gibbons voice, and youd be sort of right; guitarist and contributing songwriter Adrian Utley mentioned in a recent New York Times article that one of the rules they set for Third was that they couldnt fall back on any instruments-- or even any trademark sounds-- that theyd used on previous albums. But their style here isnt particularly out of character, comparatively experimental as it is; Utleys guitar still twangs sharply when its not doing things like interjecting \"Iron Man\" growls in \"Hunter\" or splintering into Syd Barrett-isms at the coda of \"Small\", and the melodic identity that he and Geoff Barrow built on a foundation of minor keys and sinister grandeur still holds sway. In the terms of a group that was frequently lumped in with film composers as much as Bristol axis peers, Portisheads Euro-cool John Barry intrigue has been pushed into the disquieting territory of John Carpenters compositions and Bernard Herrmanns Alfred Hitchcock scores.\nKeep in mind just how out-of-nowhere this all seems: The notion of a new Portishead album had, for many fans, fallen out of the realm of possibility. If Third had come out in 1999 or 2000, maybe writers would be calling it Portisheads answer to Massive Attacks Mezzanine, another third album by trip-hop icons eschewing dinner-conversation music by embracing anxiety and moodiness. Released today, it instead feels like a staggering transformation and a return to form that was never lost, an ideal adaptation by a group that many people didnt know they needed to hear again.",

        "article_text": "Vampire Weekends second album starts with \"Horchata\", ostensibly a punching bag for people who didnt like their first one. Singer Ezra Koenig rhymes \"horchata\" with \"balaclava\", while keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij arranges the song around the polite plinks of marimbas. Its a sweatless calypso, buttoned-up and breezy. So, of course, haters will still find plenty to hate about Contra, and theyll hate it with vigor. Meanwhile, Vampire Weekend sound like theyve fallen in love with what they started and are hugging it tight without shame or apology.\nConsidering the ferocious objections to Vampire Weekends self-titled debut, \"Horchata\", and the rest of Contra, is brave music. Its like theyve spent the past two years building a bionic version of the band-- not only brighter and tighter, but weirder. The group nurtures its eccentricities and the result is a record full of them: Ezras stretchy, dynamic voice; Rostams fussy but colorful arrangements, packed with lots of orchestral confetti; and a sound that spans an increasingly multicultural array of genres, from American synth-pop to reggae, ska, calypso and Afro-pop. By comparison, Vampire Weekend sounds monochromatic and restrained.\nIn terms of vanguard indie bands, this makes them more digestible than Dirty Projectors but also more exciting than the relentlessly sophisticated Grizzly Bear. But Vampire Weekend also outsold both those bands. Their music was optioned for major-motion-picture soundtracks. They played Letterman, and Letterman didnt passively mock them. Ezra Koenig sang with Fucked Up. Later, they were in Vogue. Theyre a cross-cultural, cross-generational new indie band. Contras most sellable song, \"Giving Up the Gun\", is more polished than Vampire Weekends, but its many stranger ones are more imaginative than anything on their debut. Considering Contra is only their second album, theyre in an enviable position: Semi-popular and sincerely idiosyncratic.\nContra works because of its juxtapositions-- of natural sounds to processed ones; of manners to tantrums; of party rhythms to deadpan poetry; of black music to white music. \"Diplomats Son\" samples M.I.A. and features an 8-bit interpolation of Toots and the Maytals \"Pressure Drop\" amidst characters getting stoned and falling asleep in unfamiliar houses. Almost every song on the album is this rich and this delirious. And for listeners with an aversion to richness or delirium, the band still plays sweet melodies with a light touch.\nVampire Weekends willingness to take cues from a variety of styles makes them thoughtful musicians, but its the styles they draw from that makes them contemporary. Ezra Koenig once said that his clean guitar tone was a reaction to being force-fed grunge as a preteen, but he was also entering puberty when No Doubt was entering the charts, and when ska-- a sound that originated in Jamaica and became working-class British music in the 80s-- became a renewed phenomenon at teen centers across the New York metro area. Rostam Batmanglijs side project, Discovery, was an R\u0026B album made on synths and sequencers-- which, by 2009, was another synonym for \"indie rock.\" Adopting what they adopt and rejecting what they reject might make Vampire Weekend look like pretenders, but theyre not-- theyre reactionaries.\nThen again, these contradictions, passions, and superficialities are what the band seems to be thinking about-- and what Koenig has gotten sharper about writing into his lyrics. These lines dont scan as being about privilege or money, but about people struggling with their social status, something that everyone-- college-educated or not, rich or poor, people who hate Vampire Weekend and people who dont-- does at some point. (Though, as Pitchfork editor Scott Plagenhoef pointed out in 2008, the bands detractors probably wouldnt be nearly as hung up on Ezras lyrics if the people in Vampire Weekends songs-- or the people in Vampire Weekend-- seemed poor.)\nEzra isnt writing about college or Northeastern geography anymore (terrific), but the loud nouns are still there. Take \"California English\": \"Sweet carob rice cakes, you dont care how the sweets taste/ Fake Philly cheesesteak but you use real toothpaste/ Cause if that Toms dont work, if it just makes you worse/ Would you still lose all of your faith in the good earth?\" In other words, what if all the products and symbols that gave your life meaning-- and status-- fell away? What if you replaced the organic toothpaste with Colgate? (Which still \"says something\" about you, namely \"I dont have the time, inclination, or money to give a shit about toothpaste.\") Would life still look as rosy? Or, roughly, \"Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?\"\nThese arent ad-copy platitudes about the irrelevance of image-- if image didnt exist, hed have less to write about. His point is simple: Image is important, but dont think yours is better than anyone elses, especially if its constructed by things you buy. If Koenig has pity, its for people who dont accept who they are off the runway, like the guy in \"Taxi Cab\": \"When the taxi door was open wide, I pretended I was horrified, by the uniform and gloves outside of the courtyard gate\"-- the key word being \"pretended.\" For a band as superficially calculating and antiseptic as Vampire Weekend, the message is a challenge to accept that these guys-- these very polite young east-coasters who grew up with ska, punk, and African pop-- are exactly who they say they are.\nThe album ends with \"Diplomats Son\" and \"I Think Ur a Contra\", its two most musically scattered and lyrically opaque songs. \"Diplomats Son\"-- of the aforementioned M.I.A. sample and reggae breakdown-- is six minutes long; \"Contra\" fades to the sound of hand drums and acoustic guitars. On an album marked by ambitious, knotty lyrics, Koenig ends with the lines, \"Never pick sides, never choose between two, but I just wanted you, I just wanted you.\" Commitment. Surprising, but it looks beautiful on them.",

        "article_text": "Like any noise group, Fuck Buttons rely on a certain amount of vulgarity and aggression. While theyve always possessed a knack for melody that has, for their genre, provided their music with an accessible edge, listeners unaccustomed to blood-curdling screams and metal-scraping drones have had their work cut out for them when searching for the more delicate moments that helped make last years Street Horrrsing such a stunning listen.\nTarot Sport represents a subtler, more mature approach to songwriting and a sharpening of their craft. But moreso, it marks a comprehensive stylistic shift for the duos sound, from experimental noise with a buried pop sensibility to a sort of modernized electronic take on classic post-rock structures. And impressively, theyve made these changes without sacrificing any of the genre-straddling adventurousness that made them intriguing in the first place.Perhaps the best way to think about their transformation is to consider how the new material relates to post-rock groups like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The band has always had an inclination toward sweeping epics (see: \"Sweet Love for Planet Earth\"), but instead of using scale as a canvas for brutality/delicacy contrasts, here they repurpose the post-rock format as a digital soundscape. Gone are the shrieks and wailing guitar chords that populated Street Horrrsing; instead these songs are built almost wholly with synth and keyboard textures that originate in dance music.\nAiding the shift is producer Andrew Weatherall, who has a long history of infusing rock with dancefloor bounce and drawing the best from his groups. (His helming of Primal Screams epochal Screamadelica and his remix work with My Bloody Valentine are prime examples.) From the chugging drumbeat of opener \"Surf Solar\" to the chipped-up electro backdrop of finale \"Flight of the Feathered Serpent\", the dynamics and textures of techno are the foundation of the record, making a direct link between Tarot and Weatheralls earlier boundary-defying productions.\nAll of which is prologue to Tarot Sports actual songs, which by and large are pretty freaking incredible. Theres a cinematic, storytelling quality to the music, and the climactic builds of longer pieces such as \"The Lisbon Maru\"-- with its militaristic drumbeat and huge synth melodies-- conjure the excitement of an oversized movie sequence. \"Surf Solar\", extended from the clipped-length radio edit that emerged online last month, is anxious and menacing by comparison but hits those notes without the histrionics of Fuck Buttons previous work-- the band seems just too confident here to rely on screeches to get its point across.\nFuck Buttons also master shorter pieces that shift and redirect the records momentum. Close in spirit to the tribal romp of \"Ribs Out\" from Street Horrrsing-- but ultimately more listenable and imaginative-- \"Rough Steez\" envisions industrial techno as locomotive skronk. And \"Phantom Limb\" recalls genre-benders like Liquid Liquid and Gang Gang Dance with its cavernous atmosphere and snaky, complex arrangement. When the band returns to widescreen emotiveness for the triumphant closer \"Flight of the Feathered Serpent\", it feels like a victory lap-- the capper on a record that is a hell of a lot easier to like than even fans of Street Horrrsing would have expected. That was a great record, but Tarot Sport is a cut above. Perhaps surprisingly, its also a welcoming album-- and one of the best of this already fruitful year.",

        "article_text": "As weve gotten to know Bradford Cox over the last couple of years through shows, interviews, and blog posts, one of the Deerhunter frontmans most appealing qualities is his deep and nuanced appreciation of the music of others. Some musicians listen to records to see how they work, check out the competition, or trawl for ideas; by all available evidence, Cox feels records, deeply. If he was born without musical gifts and couldnt sing or play an instrument, one can imagine him working at a record store, amassing an enviable collection while driving people on a message board crazy with the sureness of his detailed opinions. Whatever you think of his exploits as an indie rock media figure, Coxs music fandom is easy to identify with and also offers a portal into his own work.\nAtlas Sound, Coxs solo alias, in one sense serves as a sort of laboratory for figuring out what makes some his favorite music tick, away from the expectations of his main band. Two collaborations on Logos, the second Atlas Sound full-length, are excellent examples of how music listening can be absorbed into original work. First is \"Walkabout\", a track Cox wrote and recorded with Noah Lennox from Animal Collective, whom Cox got to know during a European tour. Though Coxs music shades dark and Lennoxs is often flecked with uncertainty and doubt, \"Walkabout\" is the sunniest pop tune of either of their careers. Coasting on a buoyant, twinkling keyboard sample, it is a starkly catchy and irresistible, a clattery post-millennial Archies tune that straddles perfectly the border between simple and simplistic. Interestingly, it also sounds very much like a Panda Bear tune.\nThen there is Lætitia Sadier of Stereolab, who wrote the lyrics and sings lead on Logos \"Quick Canal\". The song opens with some gorgeously textured organ chords and soon a steady-state beat and drums rise up in the mix, setting the kind of relaxed-but-propulsive neo-krautrock scene that Stereolab perfected very early on. Here Cox gets to play the part of the late Mary Hansen, adding \"la-di-da\" trills behind Sadier as she intones phrases in her unfailingly lovely, for-the-ages voice. He even throws in a \"Jenny Ondioline\"-style rupture about halfway through, sending the track into a breathtaking shoegaze section for its final four minutes, wherein it floats magisterially on a pillow of shifting guitar feedback. \"Quick Canal\" is almost nine minutes long and it doesnt waste a second.\nOn these tracks, the confidence Cox shows in melting his aesthetic into the soundworld of other musicians is striking-- both are unqualified successes, very different from each other but among the best things Cox has ever done. But they also sound a lot like the music his collaborators are known for. Coxs sympathetic support and sense of how to construct songs with others suggests a desire to expand the parameters of what Atlas Sound can be. And given his willingness to let others take the microphone on an Atlas Sound project on these cuts, I cant help but go back to Coxs words on Logos before the album was released, which suggested that this was to be less introverted and that was \"not about me.\"\nAnd then I remember that the cover of the album consists of a photo of Cox with his shirt off and the lyrics in the first two songs start with the word \"I\", which suggests that we probably shouldnt take these statements very seriously. While the songs may or may not be \"about\" Cox in the strictest sense, the overall vibe is at least as introverted as 2008s Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel, and every note bears the same signature. With its strummed guitars, hushed double-tracked vocals, and tunes more reliant on ambiance and feel than melody or rhythm, Logos feels every bit as diaristic and personal, but with Cox, thats a plus. At this point, were not looking to this guy for commentary on the outside world; we want to hear him wrestle with private demons in the sanctuary of his bedroom, bathing every sound in reverb to give the illusion of space and as a sonic balm against loneliness and figuring out how to make music as affecting as the stuff he loves to listen to.\nSo tracks like \"The Light That Failed\", \"An Orchid\", and \"My Halo\" (the latter two, though different in tone, are further entries in Coxs growing line of melancholy waltz-time shuffles) function primarily as the kind of eerie, blown-out mood music he has become very good at. They are amorphous sketches that still manage to convey feeling, capturing the sort of sad, exhausted, and fragile emotional state that is Coxs area of expertise. \"Shelia\", a taut pop song with a great chorus hook, is a change-up, though the repeating refrain \"No one wants to die alone\" fits with the rest of the records themes. And \"Washington School\", with its dissonant chime of metallic percussion that sound like gamelan or evilly out-of-tune steel drums, contains the records most interesting production, with thick drones reminiscent of Tim Hecker and menacing rhythm track.\nSo some things are different, some are the same, but all of it works well together. Its true that every time Cox ventures out of his comfort zone on Logos, you wish that hed go even further and embrace extremes-- of tunefulness, tradition, noise-- that dont necessarily come to him naturally. He may yet take a big leap with Atlas Sound, but here the steps away, though rewarding, are tentative. For the rest of the record, Logos feels familiar and assuring, another affecting dispatch from a corner of indie music that is increasingly starting to seem like one Cox pretty much owns.",

        "article_text": "Deerhunter toured with Nine Inch Nails this summer, making a stop at Colorados famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre. That canyon found the Atlanta noise-rock quintet at a precipice. In the few months prior, Deerhunter had added a new guitarist, Whitney Petty, to replace the departed Colin Mee. Lead singer Bradford Cox had released his debut solo album, Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel, under the name Atlas Sound. The bands third album, Microcastle, and its would-be surprise bonus disc, Weird Era Cont., had both leaked half a year before they were due in stores. Unimpressed NIN fans were writing blog posts comparing Cox to Geddy Lee.\nLike Trent Reznor, Cox is a classic outcast. But the real question is why Deerhunter arent opening for Radiohead, as their friends in Liars and Grizzly Bear have done. Admirers and detractors of Deerhunters 2007 breakout album, Cryptograms, all seemed to agree on one thing: Despite its status as an underground hit, it didnt explore totally new sounds. Radiohead didnt invent krautrock or avant-garde electronic music, either-- let alone UK post-punk, American alt-rock, or the Beatles. Instead, what theyve done is use a stunning assortment of shrewd instrumental ideas to express contemporary anxiety and alienation, all in the form of pop songs, on albums conceived to be more than the sum of their parts.\nDeerhunter dont sound a lot like Radiohead, but theyve absorbed the UK rock icons outlook as fully as anybody. If Cryptograms holds any \"encoded message,\" I argued in a Pitchfork review, its this: Deerhunter are a pop band. Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. proves me half-right. It sidesteps much of the art-damaged squall of previous Deerhunter records, but it doesnt embrace 1950s and 60s pop as intensely as lead singer Bradford Cox had intimated in early interviews. If Cryptograms brutalized the pop ideal like a guitar-wielding David Lynch, leaving the follow-up Fluorescent Grey EP an exquisite corpse, then Microcastle resurrects it, scar tissue and all. The resulting 2xCD set captures urgent and imaginative songs that reorganize 4AD haze, off-kilter indie pop, crashing garage-punk, forward-leaning krautrock, and hypnotic Kranky ambience into a singular-sounding call-to-arms.Here, the band comes into their own by applying their own inspiringly distinctive, bleakly appealing sensibility to whatever ideas happen to move them. Fist-pumping first single \"Nothing Ever Happened\" shares most of a title with a Pavement deluxe-edition bonus track while sounding a lot like Magazines more straightforward, hard-charging side. Another standout, \"Saved by Old Times\", pipes in the Black Lips Cole Alexander for a dual-channel monologue disorientingly reminiscent of the Velvet Undergrounds \"The Murder Mystery\". (If you play it backwards, Cole namedrops Johnny Cash.)\n\"I take what I can/ I give what I have left,\" Cox sings softly, as if explaining his musical approach, on \"Green Jacket\", a piano-based track at the center of the album. Its part of the languid song suite that ends the first side of the albums vinyl edition and breaks the disc up much the way ambient interludes divided Cryptograms. Only this time, the lull lasts just 10 minutes, not 20, and even at its least structured its always more accessible. \"Microcastle\" applies the quiet-quiet-loud structure of the Breeders \"No Aloha\" to a slack, laconic rumination on starting anew. With treated mbiras, \"Activa\" turns the dream-pop of Coxs Atlas Sound solo work into a nightmare vision of wasted lives.\nDespite an outsized and often compelling persona, Cox is in some ways absent from Microcastle. The first recognizable voice we hear belongs to guitarist Lockett Pundt, on second track \"Agoraphobia\"; Pundts gentle, repetitive wordplay-- \"Cover me, come for me, comfort me\"-- cozies up against sunlit psych-pop (OK, about wanting to be buried alive for someone elses sexual gratification). Bass player Josh Fauver wrote most of \"Nothing Ever Happened\". The guitars are big, bright, and unusually unfucked-with. Theres a finger-tapping guitar solo. All credit to Moses Archuleta for the propulsive drums. Deerhunters slight shift toward directness mirrors, to an extent, the move Liars made with their harder-rocking self-titled album. It doesnt mean Microcastle breaks entirely away from album-unifying concepts. On bell-splashed Cox-Pundt collaboration \"Little Kids\", getting older means getting deader. By Pundt-led \"Neither of Us, Certainly\", its a fate devoutly to be wished. Coxs 50s and 60s pop influences play a small but significant role, linking the wordless, Flamingoes-esque opener \"Cover Me (Slowly)\" to the warped Everly Brothers waltz of finale \"Twilight at Carbon Lake\". The Beatles \"Please Please Me\" claimed that \"theres always rain in my heart\"; on dynamic single candidate \"Never Stops\", theres always winter. In the end, \"Twilight\" says smell ya later to \"the frozen shit that was in your heart.\"If you thought the bonus disc would just be crappy outtakes, then you dont know Cox. Weird Era Cont. is surprisingly great in its own right, allowing Deerhunter to join Los Campesinos! in the two-good-albums-in-2008 club. This record sparkles right from the ghostly noise-pop of \"Backspace Century\" and the jerky dance-punk of \"Operation\". The girl-group bounce of \"Vox Humana\" puts Coxs underrated lyrical skills on full display, while \"Vox Celeste\" throws the neo-shoegaze gauntlet down in the face of the reunited My Bloody Valentine. Reverb drenches Pundts voice on the luminous \"Dot Gain\". Instrumentals make a fine return, too, ranging from Faust-meets-Animal Collective loops to noise-music drones. \"Focus Group\" is a sweetly chiming Smashing Pumpkins-esque guitar anthem that nearly rivals \"Nothing Ever Happened\" for skewed pop immediacy.  The only song that appears on both discs is \"Calvary Scars\", which recounts a boys willing, public crucifixion. Its a dual theme Deerhunter also explored on their self-titled first albums scrawly post-punk barb \"Adorno\", which mashes up crucifixion and suicide. On Microcastle, \"Calvary Scars\" is an ambient lullaby with mouthlike percussion; Weird Era Cont.s \"Calvary Scars II / Aux.\" is the tracks heavier-sounding apotheosis, with an extended coda thats a bit like the live version of \"You Made Me Realise\", followed by a meditative electronic hum thats a bit like... the ringing in your ears after the live version of \"You Made Me Realise\". Or the calm after a cataclysm. Theres a clear parallel with Radioheads \"Morning Bell\", which appeared, in different versions, on both Kid A and Amnesiac.  From \"Agoraphobia\" to \"Neither of Us, Uncertainly\" to \"Calvary Scars II / Aux.\", sacrifical suicide could be a metaphor for artistic creation. On Microcastle/Weird Era Cont., Cox sacrifices himself-- or at least, his colorful persona-- for the sake of Deerhunters art. On stage, he really does sacrifice his illness-damaged body. \"I take what I can/ I give what I have left.\" From a band who, unlike their peers No Age, have studiously avoided politics, spreading the idea that salvation can be found, or at least glimpsed, in art-- let alone in stupid pop records! That you probably downloaded for free!-- is a politically potent act. Hope. Change. At the very least, a reason not to slit our throats before President Palin decides to nuke the world in 2017.",

        "article_text": "The cover of The Crying Light, the third album by Antony and the Johnsons, is strikingly similar to that of its predecessor, 2005s highly-lauded I Am a Bird Now. The latter presented a stark black-and-white shot of transvestite performer Candy Darling lying on her hospital deathbed; this time, we get an even starker image of Japanese Butoh dancer Kazuo Ohno, a hero of bandleader Antony Hegarty since he first spotted her on a poster while studying in France as a teenager. As Ohno leans back, wrinkled and seemingly near death himself, the flower in his hair sits in the same position as the bright blooms that hover above Darling.\nBut its the differences between these shots that say the most about The Crying Light. Much of what the Darling image represents-- gender identity, performance art, downtown New York circa Andy Warhols Factory-- is reflected in I Am A Bird Nows stylistic range, as well as its use of guest artists who embody those subjects, like Lou Reed and Boy George. The symbolism of the Ohno picture is simpler. The dancer, cited by Hegarty as his role model for \"getting older as an artist,\" is now 102 and can no longer move or speak; hes been cast into a limbo between life and death. \"He really practiced his form until he couldnt move,\" Hegarty told The Wire magazine in December. \"And then he kept taking the right steps inside himself.\"\nOn The Crying Light, Hegarty is fascinated with those steps-- the transitions and overlaps between birth and life, life and death, this world and the next. \"From your skin I am born again,\" he sings in \"One Dove\", an ode to a bird from \"the other side\" that comes to \"bring me some peace.\" Later, \"Aeon\" depicts eternity as a baby boy born to take care of his father, as time melts generations together. Similar concepts dot every song. With deft touch, Hegarty repeatedly uses words like \"womb,\" \"grave,\" and \"light,\" and he returns to primal metaphors-- water as life, dust as death, the earth as a place of both burial and growth. \"Im only a child/ Born upon a grave,\" he insists in \"Kiss My Name\", nearly encapsulating the entire album in one potent declarative.\nThough easier to summarize, these ideas are no less complex than those on I Am A Bird Now. In fact, theyre larger and more universal than that albums New York-tinted perspective. But they have also inspired Hegarty to craft simpler, subtler songs. Simultaneously sparse and rich, The Crying Light mines maximum intensity from a relatively minimal mix of basic melodies, pithy lyrics, and understated arrangements. It may be difficult to believe that an album crediting four arrangers and upwards of two dozen musicians could sound minimal. But the way Hegarty selects their contributions is more about precision than volume, more about carefully-chosen moments than multiple voices. Take the dark cello that closes \"Her Eyes Are Underneath the Ground\", the soft horn flourish in the middle of \"Epilepsy Is Dancing\", the fingersnap-like clicks at the end of \"The Crying Light\". These elements hint at fuller, busier versions of these songs. Maybe Hegarty did record more fleshed-out takes and then erased portions, letting their echoes float in the limbo that he sings about. Whatever his process, Hegartys use of orchestration for accent and emphasis creates undeniable power, the kind that increased sonic density likely would have lacked.\nOf course, lots of power also comes from Hegartys voice. Whats most impressive about his singing isnt its range-- though his octave-gliding trill remains spellbinding-- but the way he consistently picks the right tone at the right time. On \"Epilepsy Is Dancing\", his hum crests into a shivery warble just as the song veers into surreal imagery. He flips the trick on \"Daylight and the Sun,\" pulling back during the most plaintive lines (\"Now I cry for daylight\"), then purring fluidly through an unexpected epilogue. Most striking is \"Dust and Water,\" a droning meditiation in which his lullaby tones seem sung in a foreign language, despite the plain English found on the lyric sheet.\nThe Crying Light ends with \"Everglade\", one of the tracks Hegarty co-arranged with classical composer Nico Muhly. Filled with lilting flutes, rising strings, and operatic croon, it might be the most overtly dramatic track in the Johnsons oeuvre, like a rescued score from some lost musical. \"When Im peeping in a parlour of trees/ And the leaves are winking all around,\" he sings, \"Im home,\" my heart sobs in my veins.\" That may read ultra-drippy, but on record it sounds decidedly profound-- a fully-earned approach to the precipice of the other world Hegarty has pondered for 40 fascinating minutes. In fact, the songs redemptive tone inspires similarly wild thoughts about the future. If Hegarty can craft an album this stunning about the path to paradise, just imagine how great the next one could sound, once hes actually there.",

        "article_text": "At a glance, a Phil Elverum/Julie Doiron meet-up seems entirely apt, perhaps even inevitable. The two share collaborators, hail from sleepy corners of their respective countries, and make music a Last.fm or Pandora bot would more than likely peg as \"similar.\" Viewed a certain way, however, the two couldnt be more far afield. Elverum, as a songwriter, has long occupied himself with The Big Questions, his catalog full of probing meditations on birth and death, the elements, and the unknown. Doiron, conversely, has consistently stuck to the simple and domestic, quietly reveling in the tangible and everyday. Songs such as \"Snowfalls in November\" are patiently observed odes to satisfaction and serenity in the absolute. In short, Doiron is the contented period to Elverums searching question mark.The mini-album Lost Wisdom represents an intersection of those two distinct sensibilities and their resulting voices: Elverum, his tone often hesitant and sorrowful; Doiron, her singing reassuringly direct and familiar. For Doiron, this is a chance to wrap her warm, homespun vocals around Elverums words of uncertainty, bringing earthly color to songs which, under the Mount Eerie banner alone, might emerge cold and gray. From her entrance on opening track \"Lost Wisdom\", a stately rumination rife with natural imagery which sets the tone for the album, through her solitary vocal on the Songs-era Leonard Cohen-evoking \"If We Knew...\", and on to the closing duet \"Grave Robbers\", Doiron is a reassuring presence in song-world often threatening to capitulate to doubt.Indeed, its this presence of a second voice that distinguishes Lost Wisdom amid the abundance of post-Microphones Phil Elverum material. To hear Elverum sing of his existential quandaries in isolation is frequently compelling, but with these songs often cast as duets, were presented with the notion that Phils struggles are universal. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than on \"Voice in Headphones\", the closest thing to a standout track on Lost Wisdom, with its harmonized refrain-- borrowed from Björks \"Undo\"-- of \"Its not meant to be a strife/ Its not meant to be a struggle uphill.\" Its the sort of lyric Elverum would have the whole crowd singing along to at a show, and here-- surrounded as it is by plenty of brooding restraint-- it sounds resoundingly triumphant, a more terrestrial counterpart to the otherworldly song it quotes and a kind of modern day spiritual for those oppressed within.Elverum, too, benefits from the de facto constraints of this collaboration. The album was recorded during a brief touring respite, forcing him to forgo the intricate (if still lo-fi) ornamentation that typically adorns his output. It is instead, as he told Pitchfork, a \"documentary of a session.\" Even Fred Squires electric guitar is notably unobtrusive as it complements the two voices and the steady rumble of Phils acoustic. The result is a collection of songs so taut and concisely resonant as to be psalms. But psalms to be sung, perhaps, in secret: \"Grave Robbers\", the closing track, ends with someone abruptly shutting off the tape. In a way were made to feel as though weve been eavesdropping all the while, but even so, seldom has an act of auditory voyeurism been so rewarding.",

        "article_text": "Whether its their second release or their 60th (no ones even pretending to be sure), Fucked Ups The Chemistry of Common Life is really easy to get excited about. A lots been made about how it could possibly revitalize hardcore, although framing it within genre terms tends to lead to the wrong questions: Is it too melodic and instrumentally diverse to qualify as hardcore? Maybe. Is it heavy and chaotic enough to satisfy fans of the debut, even while it dramatically broadens their fanbase? Possibly. Can a band as destructive as Fucked Up really carry an entire scene on their sweaty, unshaven backs? Stranger things have happened.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to call Chemistry a grower: From the first listen, its both pummeling and riveting. When frontman Pink Eyes (Damien Abraham) makes his grand entrance 1.5 minutes into the massive album opener \"Son the Father\", he channels G.G. Allin by way of Les Savy Favs Tim Harrington, delivering fiercely intelligent lyrics in a singing voice presumably treated by years of guzzling Canadian Club and then eating the bottles.\nThat said, The Chemistry of Common Life is a guitarists album: 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk) and producer Jon Drew balance classic rock force with shimmering overdubs, at times recalling the Smashing Pumpkins, while at others echoing the layered, chiming guitars and famed loud/quiet dynamics of Bossanova-era Pixies. First single \"No Epiphany\" has 18 overdubs alone. Fractured harmonies bring \"Crooked Head\" to its cruising altitude, while breakneck opener \"Son the Father\" is almost tactile in its texture, with power chords and rich overtones busting into an arm-swingng chorus that doubles as the records thesis: \"Its hard enough being born in the first place/ Who would ever want to be born again?\"\nIts a hell of a pace to sustain, particularly after the bongo-laced battering ram \"Magic Word\", but Fucked Up get plenty of help: Chemistry is an \"it takes a nation of millions\" endeavor, born out of a sense of community and the determination to create something huge. According to the band, something along the lines of 70 tracks of instruments went into the making, as well as guest vocals from Vivian Girls and Sebastian Grainger (formerly from Death From Above 1979). Its not a situation where Fucked Up are seeking credit merely for beginning the album with a flute or other decidedly non-hardcore instruments. These touches often provide the most memorable moments: The gorgeous curtain-raise of female voices that open \"No Epiphany\"; \"Twice Born\" and its shout-along chorus (\"Hands up if you think youre the only one denied!\"); the mystic Black Mountain-style duet on \"Royal Swan\".\nAlong with a sense of community, the album also offers a refreshing take on religion. Fucked Ups spiritual bent is something richer than believers being targeted by secularists aiming to make them look stupid (theres your Religulous spoiler-- save the $10): Chemistry is questioning but rarely cynical, the albums midsection testing faith in the face of reason and science, and finding meaning in the actual search for answers (\"Days of Last\", \"No Epiphany\").\nChemistry doesnt sit still, and perhaps paradoxically, its most palatable track might be its most divisive-- judging from the ringing open-chords and insistent drum beat of \"Black Albino Bones\", you might get the idea that this is actually an indie rock album (oh yeah, it is on Matador), a forgotten Husker Du track, or god forbid, pop-punk. Were it given a more conventional vocalist, it could easily sidle into MTV with more ease than this performance of \"Twice Born\". But while \"Black Albino Blues\" marks the albums most melodically uplifting track, it might be the most lyrically melancholy, furthering the message of the title track that the magic in our lives is still often a result of nature. \"Its the little things that get us through life,\" barks Pink Eyes before Dallas Green sweetens up with \"I need a little escape.\" This still being Fucked Up, its a song about sex and drugs, but if they happened to leave something out of that eternal triad, its only because The Chemistry of Common Life kicks enough ass to demand inclusion on its own terms.",

        "article_text": "The-Dream earned his respect as a songwriter who co-wrote larger-than-life pop anthems, penning \"Umbrella\" for Rihanna and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" for Beyoncé, as well as less-known but evocative tracks for everyone from Usher (\"Trading Places\") to Rick Ross (\"All I Really Want\"). His solo debut, 2007s Love/Hate, broke through with minor hits \"Shawty Is Da Shit\" and \"Falsetto\", whose wildly addictive hooks papered over his slight persona. The rest of that record created a constellation of characteristics that laid out his aesthetic-- the lush production courtesy of beatmakers L.O.S. and Tricky Stewart, songs that wash into each other in the mode of a DJ mix to create a miniature suite with precision sequencing.\nOn Love vs. Money, The-Dreams second LP, he tried to replicate this effect. Although the epic sweep of the second albums final third was The-Dream at a songwriting peak, the front-loaded pop songs-- particularly \"Walking on the Moon\"s thin attempt at literal transcendence-- felt like shadows of past achievements. Even so, it was another vital chapter in an unusual career, as The-Dream has balanced the mercenary hit-making obsessions of his peers with the tender loving care of an auteur working out a unified statement.\nLove King, the alleged final chapter in his Love Trilogy, is the thrilling conclusion to his three-album arc. If youve been charmed by The-Dreams strengths-- Tin Pan Alley song concepts and an unceasing sense of musical craft-- then youll be immensely satisfied with the music here. The record argues for The-Dreams identity as an album artist whose tics and stylistic effects have created a self-sustaining world of distinctive R\u0026B, and in a style that proudly wears its influences on its sleeve.\nAs a debut single, \"Love King\" felt like a cobbled-together collection of these attributes: the expected \"radio killa\" ad-libs, self-mythologizing, and hooks with familiar insistence. But it turned out to be a pump fake, because here it makes for a great table-setting opener. Love King builds on Love/Hate and Love vs. Money by indulging in emotional and melodic excess. The-Dream knows where to find the sweet spot, and he has an uncanny knack for how pieces of music fit together. When a song would be best served by space, he gives it plenty. Every piano chord and finger snap and bass hit is in its right place. He sweats every detail but never loses sight of how the album works as a whole.\n\"Yamaha\", the most immediately powerful track on the record, is one example of what he does so well. It pushes The-Dreams earlier Prince nod \"Fast Car\" even further in the direction of outright imitation, with searing hooks, nakedly lustful appeals, and an arrangement and instrumentation that pay homage to the R\u0026B of the early 1980s. As the song unwinds, you feel like youre sharing the songwriters love of this music, and marveling at the way that he absorbs it into his own aesthetic. The following \"Nikki Part 2\", emerging from the twinkling synths of \"Yamaha\", keeps the run going, the melancholy of the verses ultimately finding transcendent emotional recognition when the song opens on the chorus. And then the urgent drama of \"Abyss\", a perfect title for a song that feels like an emotional freefall, completes the mid-album triptych, its epic chorus evoking a cold-water plunge of claustrophobic betrayal. These highly charged moments are balanced by more understated tracks. \"Turnt Out\" is The-Dream at his easiest and most likable, and its one of the albums few moments of restraint. Meanwhile, \"February Love\" turns Love vs. Money fan favorite \"Fancy\" from a grandiose statement to a more intimate memory.\nThe-Dreams debut had the advantage of appearing in a vacuum, enabling him to balance his traditional songwriting impulses with a unique creative approach. Once it became apparent that the latter direction had garnered him a loyal following, the pressure to give more generously to that audience led to an imbalance on Love vs. Money. With Love King, it no longer feels as if hes splitting the difference between his pop star ambition and a large cult of admirers. By breaking down the detachment that made him such a popular songwriter to follow his personal musical vision, and its taken him to a place only he could find.",

        "article_text": "My first introduction to Junior Boys was in autumn 2003. I had taken half a year off to travel alone, and Id just left London, where a friend had given me a copy of the Birthday EP. Id heard the single once or twice in passing before, but my first meaningful interaction with it wasnt until later that week, on a nine-hour night train ride from Austria to Budapest. I listened to the whole EP on repeat that night, its brittle rhythms and gleaming synths coalescing with the dark shapes and city lights in constant renewal on the other side of my window, the unfamiliarity of my surroundings giving it all a further resonance.\nThere are special songs, and there are special memories, but if youre one of those nostalgia-bitten people for whom neither seem quite vivid enough on their own, nothing matches what happens when the two dovetail. The beauty of these moments is they refuse to be architected-- we cant force them any more than we can explain them. And while the Junior Boys arent magicians, they speak the language of that magic as well as anyone making music today. (In the bands official bio, K-Punk blogs Mark Fisher writes that So This Is Goodbye is a \"travel sick\" record-- Id go him one further and say that specific sensation of travel sickness is at stake every time they set out to make music.)\nJust their second full-length overall, So This Is Goodbye isnt just an improbable notch above 2004s Last Exit-- its also among the best records youll hear all year. The first complete album made by vocalist Jeremy Greenspan without the aid of founding member and presumed rhythmic engine Johnny Dark, it finds the Boys (now rounded out by onetime engineer Matthew Didemus) working within comparatively streamlined song structures, the rhythmic capriciousness that so strongly informed their debut all but erased from the whiteboard. And yet, despite this radical formal departure, Goodbye draws out so many of the same sensations and colors that it feels like a natural next step. If anything, the absence of those slippery rhythm tracks puts the focus even more squarely on Greenspan, who delivers with a record full of elegant melodies.\nBeyond the glowing synthlines, frigid percussions, and Greenspans marvellously tensile voice (imagine Ben Gibbard with much higher cheekbones), the Junior Boys greatest weapon is space. With an economical 10 tracks spread out over nearly 49 minutes, the pop in So This Is Goodbye is hardly immediate; instead, its songs are allowed to percolate and unfurl. On paper, especially to the average thrillseeker, that might sound a bit offputting, but its not like these are all ballads, either. Opener \"Double Shadow\" begins with a gentle pattering sequence of synth beads but blooms into a smartly melodic slice of electrohouse that Booka Shade would be proud to call their own. Elsewhere, with its serrated analog lead, gushy pads, skipping rhythms, and pressurized vocals, \"The Equalizer\" accounts for one of the albums finest arrangements, while the uptempo first single \"In The Morning\" finds Greenspan merging icy r\u0026b with 4ADs warm guitar sounds to beautiful effect.\nIn the end, though, the biggest goosebumps come courtesy of the slowburners. The penultimate track \"When No One Cares\" recasts the Sinatra standard as a wobbly space ballad, closer \"FM\" crosses the finish line in an unhurried cloud of staccato arpeggios and warm harmonies, and standout \"Count Souvenirs\" marries liquefied synths and keening minor-key melodies with the albums starkest imagery (\"Empty stalls and shopping malls that well never see again/ Hotel lobbies like painful hobbies that linger on\"). Finally, the album’s title track finds Greenspan singing: \"So this is goodbye, no need to lie/ This creature of pain, has found me again/ So this is goodbye,\" possibly in reference to Dark, or to his departed former label head Nick Kilroy, or to someone else entirely. Its the albums heartbeat, as well as one of its weightiest moments-- an acknowledgment that in times of despair the best course of action is often just to keep moving. Wanderlust never sounded so good.",

        "article_text": "What happens in the margins of the music Liz Harris makes as Grouper is often as important as the music itself. In a performance at Krakows Unsound Festival earlier this month, the rattle of a film projector added a layer of instant nostalgia to her murky swirls of voice and guitar. Much of the time, Groupers music is so diffuse that theres no longer any distinction between center and margin anyway, no difference between foreground and background.\nThat is not the case on Ruins, the first album from the Portland, Oregon, musician since last years The Man Who Died in His Boat. Here, the incidental noises—crickets, croaking frogs, thunder and rain, and, at one point, the unmistakable beep of a microwave oven that fired up after a blackout in the house where she was recording—serve primarily to underscore how stark the music is, unadorned and pocked with vast silences. Ruins is Groupers \"unplugged\" record, essentially, as much as that might sound odd for a musician who has always put acoustic guitar and piano and voice at the core of her work. Here, however, she foreswears the looping pedals and the innumerable layers of fuzz that are just as essential to her aesthetic. What were left with is achingly beautiful and, given the intensely private nature of most of Groupers work—on stage, she often plays sitting down, crouched over in order to manipulate her effects pedals, her face hidden in shadow—almost unnervingly direct.\nThe emotional core of the album is the four melancholy songs for piano and voice, which are complemented by two instrumentals of a similar mood. Rarely have Harris lyrics been so clearly audible, and rarely, if ever, has love been so plainly the focus of her songwriting. \"I hear you calling and I wanna go/ Run straight into the valleys of your arms,\" she sings on \"Holding\", her multitracked close harmonies reminiscent of Low circa The Curtain Hits the Cast. On the devastating \"Clearing\", she sings, \"Every time I see you/ I have to pretend I dont\"; on \"Call Across Rooms\", she has a change of heart: \"I have a present to give you/ When we finally figure it out.\" (\"The song is on one level very plain and literal, about a letter I wrote for someone I loved and could not get along with,\" she told Vogue.)\nNot everything is so explicit. In \"Clearing\", she keeps her vocal range between the notes of her piano chords, as though she were seeking refuge there, and her wispy voice frequently dissolves into indecipherability, like cold breath passing through a beam of sunlight. Her phrasing is tentative and guarded; even without recourse to her trusty loops, she finds ways to muddy the atmosphere. Multitracking offers a way of hiding behind her own shadow, and her foot rarely leaves the pianos sustain pedal, even on the instrumental numbers.\nOnly two songs on the album dont quite fit the mold. The opening \"Made of Metal\", essentially a means of clearing the air, is just a slow, ritualistic drumbeat wreathed in the sound of distant frogs. And the closing \"Made of Air\" returns us to the drifting ambient world of Grouper that were most familiar with. The latter dates back to 2004, and its of a piece with other material from that period, like her 2005 album Way Their Crept, where looping tones of uncertain provenance—Voice? Guitar? Keyboard?—swirled into a jellied haze. It doesnt necessarily fit with whats come before it, but its a welcome addendum to the album, if only for its familiarity.\nRuins has a vivid sense of place. Harris recorded the album in 2011 during an artistic residency in Aljezur, Portugal—a tiny coastal town tucked inside a nature preserve on the southwestern corner of the country. In a press release, she describes the pleasures of recording simply, hiking to the beach, and getting lost in her head, working out \"a lot of political anger and emotional garbage… The album is a document. A nod to that daily walk. Failed structures. Living in the remains of love.\" Even without knowing the particulars of the albums backstory, the naked recording means that you can practically picture the room in which it was made—the worn floorboards, or maybe ceramic tiles, dusted with sand; the stucco walls, slightly damp; the steam rising from a cup of tea near the upright piano. Even the microwave that made the tea, which beeps once towards the end of \"Labyrinth\", an accidental noise allowed to remain in the final cut. From the hushed mood and half-enunciated vocals of it all, you get the feeling she didnt speak to many people during that time of focused creativity. Lucky for us.",

        "article_text": "Real Estate were born in the depths of one New Jersey summer. Frontman Martin Courtney had just returned home to his native Ridgewood from college in Washington State, a few fresh songs in his pockets. Hed been playing music with bassist Alex Bleeker and guitarist Matthew Mondanile since high school in various forms, even covering Weezer and the Strokes records from tip to tail. But during the summer of 2008, Real Estate didnt get nostalgic for just their specific suburban nights, crushes, or favorite bands as teens-- they fashioned a tin can-and-string to memories more universal. Their self-titled debut LP is a collection of those first underwater pop songs and onward, 7\" cuts and mpfrees that have been backstroking their way across the Web and into lo-fi nerdpiles. Over the past year, many of these songs have soundtracked a time when it feels like every kid in or just out of college seems to be handcrafting/clamoring for music that shuttles us back to a time before career choices, adult responsibility, and this recession.\nAnd while the Jersey Shore has clearly become the beating heart of their current aesthetic, Real Estate captures a rock band several lengths ahead of the fuzzy beach bums with which they pine. Real Estate share tones with North Jersey indie rock titans Yo La Tengo and the Feelies, pouring those influences through warm impressions of oldies radio. Riffs are cyclical and massaged, harmonies familiar. Each song is dunked in reverb and delay, though always with serious restraint. Most importantly, all boast architecture that still allows for swaths of jamming, the feeling that every measures unfolding as easily as life ought to.\n\"Atlantic City\" is a fitting entrance point, an instrumental that lopes along on a humid bass line before Courtney and Mondanile (the mind behind the cassette adventures of Ducktails) begin gently braiding together strands of trebly surf guitar over Mexican güiro. Single \"Beach Comber\" keeps things light as Courtney looks for meaning in the sand while Mondanile pokes around with his Strat. The bedrock here (see \"Fake Blues\") is almost krautrock-y in the way each layer repeats itself, a bent that might prove too drowsy for some. But as is the case for much of the experience, Mondanile adds classic rock sugars throughout, taking off on a solo at the three-minute mark that unbuttons everything really gracefully.\nElsewhere, \"Black Lake\" is a gorgeous waltz whose slide recalls Modest Mouses late-1990s take on the 1959 Santo \u0026 Jonny classic \"Sleepwalk\". Because Courtneys croon can be tough to make out at times, those watercolor frequencies lend that overwhelming sense of longing real grip, jam passages often more evocative than spaces that feature vocals. Nowhere on this debut is that better absorbed than on midpoint palate-cleanser \"Lets Rock the Beach\" or the six-minute shimmer of \"Suburban Beverage\".\nWith the exception of the limp \"Pool Swimmers\", every part remains remarkably crisp. But what sets Real Estate apart from the rest of the herd is how evergreen its beauty can be. Despite the summery song titles and the beach balling associations that might follow these guys around, this music transcends the notion of seasons. Inside the overcast tenor of \"Black Lake\" and the airy upstrokes of \"Green River\", theres much more at play here than what goes on between the months of June through September. And impressionism aside, this is a band whose chemistry and technical gifts suggest theres more coming down the pipeline: more good times to be soundtracked, and more songs and records and sounds to communicate exactly that.",

        "article_text": "If youve followed Matthew Dear over the years, then you know he doesnt like to stay in one place for very long. Even as a primarily electronic artist in the early 2000s, Dear hopped from label to label, switched aliases often, and made everything from steely microhouse to harder Detroit techno. But his biggest departure was 2007s Asa Breed, the record where he stepped out from behind the decks and reached for the mic. Singing on tracks and leaning more heavily on song structure, he built strange hybrid music that had one foot in techno and the other in pop.\nDears latest album, Black City, follows this path but pulls a pretty drastic shift in tone. Where Asa Breed was bubbly and squeaky and ultimately dancefloor-bound, this record is dark as night. The music brings to mind blown-out warehouses, desolate alleys, and seedy basement nightclubs; its some real threatening, grimy shit. The production is as inventive and immersive as ever, but what separates this album from the last is that Dear mostly sticks with one theme all the way through. Asa Breed was all over the place at times, but this album has a cohesive thread to follow and smaller vignettes within it.\nIts worth noting on a general level that Black City isnt always an easy listen-- theres a lot of detail that can take a couple of spins to get comfortable with. Part of this is structural. Dear doesnt really do clean electro-pop; his approach is more about pushing contrasting sounds together and leaving the edges jagged. The other part is his vocals. Dear is not a classically strong singer and can often sound pretty flat; importantly he knows how to make up for it. He uses technology to stretch his natural range, wrapping choruses around beats in creative ways and sometimes layering multiple vocals together to create depth.\nSo the album has a lot of contrast and textural nuance. Theres also a good amount of sex. In the first half, Dear explores this really nocturnal, salacious sound. Songs in this section are either slow-paced come-ons or faster club tracks, but they all ooze attitude and lust. Opener \"Honey\" is a good example of the former, kind of a sauntering R\u0026B number with a gritty noise instrumental at its core. But one song stands out: \"You Put a Smell on Me\" is just total industrial-dance smut, with Dear soliciting an indecent ride \"in [his] big black car.\" Mechanical synths grind, beats scrape against the wall, and Dear offers up double entendre: \"You decide if you want to come.\" It might just be the raunchiest-sounding track since NINs \"Closer\".\nDear gets that theres no point in going any dirtier after this, and he uses the rest of the album to divert the vibe towards something brighter. Its a move that threatens the overall theme, but it ultimately works in maintaining the idea of deep contrast and dark vs. light. So the back-end is more pastoral sounding-- beats dont grind as hard and vocals open up, feel more skyward. Rather than the dark disco earlier on, songs in this portion hew closer toward Eno/Talking Heads ambient pop, and theres some really beautiful stuff here. \"Gem\", the closer, is one of the albums best. A big, opulent track about loss and regret, its both deeply sad and optimistic at the same time. And the album needs a big emotional anchor like this, otherwise you might feel a little filthy for enjoying it so much.",

        "article_text": "To date, Lykke Lis biggest exposure was her song \"Possibility\" appearing on the Twilight: New Moon soundtrack. From a producers standpoint, her inclusion was a no-brainer: Not only was her debut titled Youth Novels, but it captured the intense yearning of youth, which is also an aim of the Twilight series. Few indie artists seemed as well poised as Li to vocalize Stephenie Meyers heroines point of view. As the singer herself told Pitchfork recently, \"I like that age when you feel misunderstood and still believe in the pure idea that love conquers all\"-- perhaps the most concise and astute explanation of that franchises appeal.\nThat is, however, only one aspect of Lis considerable appeal. As vampire franchises go, she has much more in common with Buffy Summers than the shrinking Bella Swan: Li can kick serious ass, yet even at her toughest, she nurses a persistent desire for a normal and secure life, which-- if her second album, Wounded Rhymes, is any indication-- involves intense love, great sex, and weird dance moves. Li proves a rich and compelling character in her songs, which are dark but also complex, contradictory, and, thank goodness, still rough around the edges.\nLike Joss Whedons show, Wounded Rhymes is an album of stark, scintillating contrasts: between fantasy and reality, between the powerful and the vulnerable, between the brash and the quiet, between the rhythmic and the melodic. Audacious anthems jostle next to heartbreak ballads like \"Unrequited Love\", with its simple guitar and shoo-wop backing vocals. Dense, busy numbers give way to emotionally and musically stripped tracks like \"I Know Places\". \"Im your prostitute, you gon get some,\" she sings on \"Get Some\", a come-on so blunt that its become the talking point for this album. As a single, the song brazenly grabs your attention, but in the context of this album, alongside such forlorn songs, it becomes a desperate statement, disarmingly intimate in its role-playing implications but also uncomfortably eager to shed or adopt new identities to ensure a lovers devotion.\nRather than adjust or reconcile them, Li lets all those contradictions ride, having grown more comfortable in her musical skin. While there are no highs here quite as high as Youth Novels \"Little Bit\" or \"Breaking It Up\" (and no low nearly as low as \"Complaint Department\", though \"Rich Kids\" comes pretty damn close), there is a sense of cohesion missing from that debut, as well as an understanding that a record can be a document of a particularly tumultuous time and place. To write these songs, Li spent long months in New York and Southern California, spending a great deal of time alone in the desert. The result is depressive without being depressing, dark without being bleak, as it rejuvenates, refines, and redirects her eccentricities.\nThe biggest moments on Wounded Rhymes take the form of slower ballads, whether stripped down like \"I Know Places\" or grandiose like \"Sadness Is a Blessing\". But they gain their power in contrast to the more upbeat tracks like opener \"Youth Knows No Pain\". Dropping some of the coy affectations of Youth Novels, Li proves a surprisingly dramatic singer with a powerful voice and strong phrasing, able to render the emotional pain of \"Sadness Is a Blessing\" as somehow exultant-- a transcendent state of being.\nLike any good vocalist, she knows when to bow out and let the music speak for her. \"I Know Places\" cuts off early to set up a long, dreamy coda that acts as both a quiet promise of escape and an album intermission that sets up the penultimate \"Jerome\", which seems to synthesize every single emotional and musical urge on the album. Both ballad and banger, the song sheds its elements until only the thunderous heartbeat rhythm remains. That moment bleeds into the finale, \"Silent My Song\", a nearly a cappella closer that swells and fades dramatically. \"No fist needed when you call,\" Li sings. \"You silent my song.\" Its a devastating statement, yet ultimately an untrustworthy one: She has harnessed her heartache and her happiness to amplify her voice, not to lose it.",

        "article_text": "Fleet Foxes unpretentious, crowd-pleasing directness was the key to their rapid rise. Their Sun Giant EP and self-titled debut LP, both released in 2008, brimmed with inviting melodies, evocative lyrics, and open-armed harmonizing that seemed designed to reach a wide variety of listeners. Their bright folk-rock sound wasnt exactly \"cool,\" but that was sort of the point-- its familiar in the most pleasing way, lacking conceit or affectation. Their expression of their love for music (and making music) was refreshing three years ago, and that sort of thing never gets old.\nBut clouds inevitably roll in. On the bands follow-up, Helplessness Blues, the mood is darker and more uncertain, adding shade to their gold-hued sound. The change in tone reflects the tumultuous road Fleet Foxes traveled during the albums creation. In late 2009, Fleet Foxes had an albums worth of songs ready, but the tracks were mostly scrapped before mixing. The arduous creative process took a toll on the group members, particularly singer/songwriter Robin Pecknold, who told Pitchfork at the time, \"The last year has been a really trying creative process where Ive not been knowing what to write or how to write.\"\nThe groups persistence paid off, though: Helplessness Blues is comparatively deeper, more intricate, and more complex, a triumphant follow-up to a blockbuster debut. Working again with producer Phil Ek, theyve crafted a cavernous record that allows more room for them to breathe and stretch. The albums longer, episodic cuts contain disquieting shifts in tone. \"The Plains/Bitter Dancer\", for example, begins as a spindly, psychedelic folk tune reminiscent of some of the Zombies more introspective moments, and then, after a brief pause, bursts suddenly into the type of gangland chorus Fleet Foxes have practically trademarked by now. Elsewhere, shorter songs seem to end mid-thought; the rollicking tumble of \"Battery Kinzie\" cuts off suddenly, while \"Sim Sala Bim\"s heavy-strummed raga quickly unfurls like broken strings. This battle between tension and serenity is new to the bands repertoire, and it lends the album a compelling uneasiness that starkly contrasts the sunnier disposition of their first two releases.\nThe group harmonies that flowed from Fleet Foxes are in shorter supply here, employed largely to embellish tracks, allowing Pecknold to take a clearer lead role, both vocally and lyrically. He first emerged as an impressionistic songwriter, but hes since become stronger and more descriptive, conjuring vivid imagery of men striking matches on suitcase latches and penny-laden fountains. Mostly, he spends time working out his own personal puzzles, pondering the big questions of existence and meditating on the dissolution of his five-year relationship during one of Helplessness Blues more difficult creative periods.\nThe record reflects his determination to deal with the present while leaving the past behind. At times, Pecknolds voice takes an aggressive tone, as on the eight-minute breakup saga \"The Shrine/An Argument\"; other times, it cracks slightly, exposing his pain on the bittersweet \"Lorelai\". But the warmth is there. On the albums most intimate track, \"Someone Youd Admire\", he contemplates the contradictory impulses to love and to destroy, accompanied by spare harmony and softly strummed guitar.\nPecknold confronts more universal concerns as well, starting with \"Montezuma\"s memorable album-opening lines: \"So now, I am older/ Than my mother and father/ When they had their daughter/ Now, what does that say about me?\" He wrestles throughout the record with his own measurements of success, and whether any of it adds up to anything. He asks questions only to come up with more questions, and they all lead into a sort of resolution on the albums title track, \"Helplessness Blues\". Here, he retreats from the world into idyllic, pastoral imagery and wishes for a simpler life before trying to come to grips with his newfound renown. \"Someday Ill be like the man on the screen,\" he promises at the end of the song.\nHelplessness Blues analytical and inquisitive nature never tips into self-indulgence. Amidst the chaos, the record showcases the bands expanded range and successful risk-taking, while retaining what so many people fell in love with about the group in the first place. And once again, a strong sense of empathy is at the heart of what makes Fleet Foxes special. Much has been made of American indies recent obsession with nostalgic escapism, but Robin Pecknold doesnt retreat. He confronts uncertainty while feeling out his own place in the world, which is something a lot of us can relate to.",

        "article_text": "When it quietly showed up on YouTube last November, the darkly surreal video for Prodigys \"Mac 10 Handle\" felt like a glorious fluke. More than a decade ago, a teenage Prodigy-- half of the existential Queensbridge duo Mobb Deep-- had been one of the fiercest and murkiest rappers in New York. But that dark star faded quickly in 2001, when Jay-Z, onstage at Hot 97s Summer Jam, sneeringly displayed a picture of a young Prodigy wearing a dance-class uniform: \"You was a ballerina/ I got the pictures, I seen ya.\" That blow seemed to send Mobb Deep into freefall. The next few years saw the group making a series of ill-advised moves, collaborating with the silky r\u0026b quartet 112 and the braying producer Lil Jon on tracks that defanged the Mobbs nihilist magnetism. Later still, the apparent final nail: Mobb Deep signed with G-Unit and released the dismal Blood Money, an album that tried to replace their gritty expressionism with vindicated new-money gloating. It failed colossally.\nBut six months later, there was Prodigy on YouTube, muttering hazy death threats over the nervous percussion-ripples and eerie bass-burbles of Edwin Starrs \"Easin In\". With its harsh, grainy film-stock, the \"Mac 10 Handle\" video seemed miles removed from anything on the Sucka Free Countdown mixtape. It was the image of a once-great rapper tossing away his commercial ambitions and digging instead into what we loved him for in the first place. Prodigy maintains that grizzled intensity through the entirety of Return of the Mac, a stronger comeback than anyone would ever have guessed.\nReturn of the Mac is just 10 songs and four interludes, and its over in 40 minutes, barely half the length of the average major-label event-rap album. The beats all come from the New York-based producer and frequent Mobb collaborator Alchemist, whose intuitive chemistry with Prodigy makes for one of the most fruitful rapper-producer pairings in a while. Here, Alchemist creates a warm, organic bedrock for Prodigys cold, weary monotone; in the producers hands, the rappers weathered crackle of a voice feels like a natural outgrowth of the landscape. Alchemist heavily samples the lush psychedelic soul of early-70s blaxploitation film soundtracks, wringing those weeping strings and disembodied moans for maximum pathos. Over those tracks, Prodigys violent threats dont sound gratuitous; they become the commonsense warnings of a tired old gunslinger.\nOver and over on Return of the Mac, Prodigy laments his own desensitization, constantly muttering variations on one theme: \"New York made me this way.\" Success was never a great fit for P; a sufferer of sickle cell anemia, he always had a joyless bluntness in his voice even when he was celebrating his wealth, like the money in his pocket couldnt ease the pain in his bones. So the patient hardness he displays on this LP feels much more natural. Half the time, he doesnt even bother to rhyme, but his images still resonate: \"Have different colors leaking out you/ Like red, yellow, and white/ Got some stomach on your Nikes.\"\nLyrically and musically, Return of the Mac feels like an immersion into a pre-Giulinani New York that may never have actually existed. Slowly, a lyrical picture emerges of the old, hard New York, a place where hopelessness leads to bad faith and violence. But as at home as he might be in the squalor, Prodigy never delights in it, lamenting instead: \"Niggas bodied JMJ right there in Queens/ Goes to show theres no respect for the OGs.\" Alchemists invocation of that era is entirely theoretical. The producer, after all, grew up white and privileged in Beverly Hills, first coming to prominence with the Whooliganz, the rap duo he formed as a teenager with James Caans son Scott. But even if Alchemists New York is a fantasy dystopia learned from old movies and rap records, it meshes perfectly with Prodigys battered memories.\nReturn of the Mac isnt a rehabilitation move for Prodigy; he neither flaunts nor denounces his G-Unit affiliation, and only makes occasional passing references to 50 Cent. What it is is the announcement of a stunning and unexpected late-career renaissance; Prodigy is tapping back into the fearsome frustration that once drove him. Amazingly, P originally conceived this piece of work-- the best thing hes done in well over a decade-- as a promotional mixtape, a quick move to build anticipation for H.N.I.C. 2, his official second solo album. \"This the mixtape; imagine how the album sound,\" he says on \"Stop Fronting\". But if the presumably more commercially aware H.N.I.C. 2 is anywhere near as powerful as Return of the Mac, Ill be amazed. Again.",

        "article_text": "Pesky comparisons to Bob Dylan have dogged Kristian Matsson throughout his short career as the Tallest Man on Earth. In 2006, his self-titled EP introduced a singer with that familiar croak, a songwriter with a folk-revival revival sensibility, and a guitar player with an impressively agile fingerpicking style. The next year, his full-length debut, Shallow Grave, expanded nicely on those ideas, buffing away some of the rougher edges but emphasizing fully realized and beautifully evocative songs. The Wild Hunt, the second Tallest Man on Earth album and first for Dead Oceans, makes a few specific nods to Dylan at his most earnest and bare-- including a reference to \"boots of Spanish leather\" on \"King of Spain\". Ultimately, though, Matsson interprets Dylan, just as Dylan himself interpreted Guthrie. More to the point, Matsson translates him into the Scandinavian countryside, where he sings about changing seasons and quiet, lonely places far from cities. His lyrics are rough and often ragged, more concerned with evoking aching emotions than with making explicit sense. But that coded aspect only makes him sound more urgent, as if hes trying to convince you of something he couldnt possibly put into words.\nAs with previous albums, The Wild Hunt features mainly voice and guitar, and in this intimate, austere setting-- where the banjo on the title track sounds like an indulgence-- Matsson coaxes a wide range of colors from that limited palette, whether its the testiness of \"Youre Going Back\" or the exuberance of \"King of Spain\". His grounding in American Southern traditions is apparent: While not a blues musician per se, Matsson draws important lessons from the likes of Mississippi John Hurt and Bukka White by realizing that his guitar speaks as loudly and as clearly as he does.\nHis playing is sophisticated but never showy, alternating between spry picking and forceful strumming. Whether due to his tunings or his crisp production, theres something bright and expectant about his songs, so that even at his most forlorn, as on \"Love Is All\" or \"The Drying of the Law  ns\", Matssons heraldic guitar playing generates a certain major-key hopefulness that softly shades the songs. When he switches to an old and battered piano on the teen anthem \"Kids on the Run\", the effect is not diminished but amplified, as the instrument reverberates uneasily. Its an unexpected moment that colors everything that came before it and paints Matsson as a distinctive and singular artist.\nAs a singer, he has become much more confident and capable, using that wily, deceptively limited croak with greater nuance and subtlety. The hiccup hook on \"Love Is All\" sounds like a joyful noise despite the songs tentative tone, and the rawness of his vocals lends gravity to the accusations of \"Youre Going Back\". On the other hand, Matsson sounds warmly generous on \"Troubles Will Be Gone\" when he sings, \"The day is never done, still theres a light on where you sleep, so I hope someday your troubles will be gone.\" Matsson is both a romantic and a realist, and on The Wild Hunt, he uses the barest of pop-folk settings to give mundane moments-- another break-up, another tour, another change of season, another Dylan comparison-- a grandeur so disproportional that its difficult not to identify and sympathize with him.",

        "article_text": "When Dan Snaiths Manitoba released Up in Flames in early 2003 it felt like a debut. Bearing little resemblance to the cuddly IDM of 2001s Start Breaking My Heart, Up in Flames felt like the work of another mind, and logic dictated that the project should have a different name. The Gods of Music apparently agreed but were a little slow on the uptake; finally sensing the marked shifts in tone and focus they sent Handsome Dick Manitoba of the Dictators to smite the project. Papers were served, a trade infringement lawsuit was threatened, and Caribou was born.\nBummer that the record racks of the world are going to get more confusing, but in purely musical terms the name change isnt such a bad thing. The Milk of Human Kindness sounds once again like an album from a band without a past, a band ready to take risks and go where the music needs to go. The contrast between The Milk of Human Kindness and Up in Flames is certainly less pronounced than the jump from the debut, but the feel here-- clearer arrangements and better songs, both more expansive and comparatively sober-- is new to Snaith.\nI should explain that when I say that Caribou sounds like a band without a past, I mean a past of their own. Certain historical strands from the last 35 years or so of rock are easy to discern. Where Up in Flames referenced spiraling psychedelia, this record is more controlled, carefully choosing its moments and arranging peaks for maximum impact. The most obvious addition to the sound is a strong dose of Krautrock, particularly the classic propulsion of Neu!\nThe opening riff of \"Bees\", for example, takes a handful of Booker T \u0026 the MGs \"Green Onions\" and spreads them like flares along the Autobahn of \"Hallo Gallo\". Thats only the bedrock rhythm, and as the song progresses Snaith indulges his fondness for dynamic builds and folds in a chorus of horns that lead to a booming drum crescendo. \"A Final Warning\" is another strong motorik beat and this time Snaith rides the efficient engine through the kandy-kolored dreamland of the Boredoms Vision Creation Newsun, exploding from dark tunnels into a vast, yawning mother sky with a wailing \"Ahhh!!!!\"\nThe noisier tracks here are a lot of fun-- the spazzy \"Brahminy Kite\" is all cymbal crash and tom roll, its martial pulse and tinny organ contrasting with a repeating vocal refrain. The flipside of these drum-heavy tunes (which you know the band is aching to play live) is \"Hello Hammerheads\", an upfront and folksy vocal where Snaith aims for Simon and Garfunkel territory and winds up in the same area code, which is saying something considering how \"just another instrument\" his crooning can be. Tying the various strands together are a well-crafted series of minute-or-two interludes, which move from Lynchian melodrama (\"Subotnick\") to manipulated bits of warped baroque (\"Drumheller\").\nSome of the \"big\" tracks remind me of the gothic reconfigurations of DJ Shadow, particularly the dramatic build-of-steam \"Pelican Narrows\", with its melancholy \"Theme From the Incredible Hulk\" piano theme and loose, splashy drumbeat, but also the gangly interlude \"Lord Leopard\". The Shadow feel is doubly interesting because, though Snaith is currently leading a full band when out on tour, complete with two drummers, he brings a record fans approach to his music. Hes digging into the past to find the best bits and combining the new ways, reinforcing the idea, suggested at on earlier Manitoba material, that his particular genius is curatorial rather than strictly inventive. However he does it, hes created another thrilling, excellent record.\n ",

        "article_text": "When it arrived in 2007, Italians Do It Betters After Dark compilation provided a way forward. \"Italo survived electroclash,\" wrote Marc Hogan; indie rock had too. Six years later, dance music has pervaded that genre to the point where discussing specific movements no longer feels relevant; its just there, and After Dark had a part in that. Its status as a modern indie/dance classic makes it easy to forget to how thin and stitched-together it felt, how delicate its papier-mache disco. Putting aside the compilations home-printed artwork and lack of jewel case, the album was rife with cover songs, demos, and remixes. Johnny Jewels return last year with Chromatics and Symmetry was notable for the musics quality but also for its scope: confirmation, finally, that the Italians Do It Better label had gas left in the tank.\nTheres always been a factory feel to Italians Do It Better, Jewel the enigmatic visionary farming his disco labor out to acolytes and hangers-on. The cast of characters assembled on After Dark 2 supports this; primary vehicles Chromatics and Glass Candy account for nearly half the tracks, but many contributions come from IDIB B-teamers recording their first music in years. If theres an exemplar of the odd IDIB universe, its Mirage (officially the 24th artist to adopt that moniker according to Discogs) who show up with only their third-ever track; the first two being available only on the original After Dark.\nThe assembly-line nature of Jewels productions provides a counterpoint to Daft Punks Random Access Memories, reminding us that while some strains of classic dance music were meticulous and expert, many were cheap and quick. Jewels ability to pump out quality tracks with a host of collaborators connects him to the faceless electro/disco producers of the 1980s; presenting the tracks as glammy punk-noir fantasies contemporizes him. Jewel is an expert stylist, able to project fashionable cool without exclusivity or mightiness. Never more so than on After Dark 2; the songs here are big and warm, tighter, more muscular updates of the originals, and they make common sadness-- the search for love, forgiveness, intimacy-- feel heroic and communal.\nThe IDIB rhythms and affectations-- thrumming Italo disco, icy female coos-- are largely unchanged, but the analog boil beneath them is robust. This is important when working with vocalists whose charm lies largely in their steely contempt for excess. Having Glass Candy back in the fold is crucial. Singer Ida Nos flat, artless vocals are a perfect foil for Jewels metronomic synthesizers. Shes also the most compelling songwriter: the resplendent \"Warm in the Winter\" is the headliner, but \"The Possessed\" and \"Beautiful Object\" deliver pleasantly sighing choruses. Chromatics sound at home on the wistful \"Cherry\", and they parry their last albums title track with the nervy \"Looking for Love\": \"Im still/ Still looking/ Looking for love,\" killing for it having failed, apparently.\nIts in this context that contributions from Farah-- severe and menacing-- and Desire-- easy and sweet-- can be lovely diversions, and that instrumentals from Mike Simonetti and Jewel (as Symmetry) can feel like luxe interludes. The vocoder funk of Mirages \"Lets Kiss\" and Twisted Wires husky piano house offer crucial variety. Lesser lights are afforded the opportunity to be lesser, in other words. They can thank the compilations album-like feel: After Dark 2 plays more like Johnny Jewel \u0026 Friends Present... than a compendium of disparate acts. It updates the IDIB sound without losing its buzzy neon charm, which remains a hugely attractive mode.",

        "article_text": "Boards of Canadas 2005 album, The Campfire Headphase, included a song called \"Chromakey Dreamcoat\" that sounded like guitar loops playing on a wobbly phonograph. You have to wonder if this was a shout-out to their lil homey Bibio, who cut three records for Mush from the whole cloth of this idea. Like his idols, he filled his electro-acoustic music with antiquated cultural products and nature sounds-- things that are beautiful because weve less and less use for them. But he lacked range, his wavering loop-collages falling into two categories: those informed by the sprightly forms of British folk, and those that were nearly formless.\nBibio released Vignetting the Compost just five months ago, and it seemed to cement his status as a pleasant one-trick pony. So its shocking how utterly and successfully he rewrites his playbook on this Warp debut. I actually have to eat a little crow. I wrote of Compost that Bibio had a \"thin, modest voice that verges on anonymity,\" and suggested that he should favor atmosphere over songcraft. This seemed justified: The more the songs approximated pop structures, the less interesting they became. But on Ambivalence Avenue, Bibio proves that he actually can sing and produce memorable arrangements. He used to make FX blurs with traces of pop and folk; now he inverts that formula with bracing clarity.\nThe results are fantastic and diverse: The title track weaves bouncing vocals through crisp guitar licks and bouncy flutes; \"All the Flowers\" is a fey folk gem; the dreamy \"Haikuesque (When She Laughs)\" is better indie-rock than many indie-rockers are making these days. Summery anthem \"Lovers Carvings\" coasts on crunchy, gleaming riffs and upbeat woodblocks, and the autumnal \"The Palm of Your Wave\" is simply haunting. Its hard to believe that these inspired, moving vocal performances are coming from the same guy who recorded moaning ambiguities like \"Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Compost\". Occasionally, youll hear a little tremble in the strings and go, \"Oh right, this is Bibio,\" but mostly, detuned atmosphere has been replaced by silky drive.\nWhile these songs are a quantum leap for Bibio, they still reasonably project from the foundation hes laid. But theres no accounting for the remainder of the album, which finds him paddling the uncharted waters of hip-hop, techno, and points outlying. \"Jealous of Roses\" sets lustrous funk riffs dancing between the stereo channels as Bibio belts out a surprisingly effective Sly-Stone-in-falsetto impersonation. \"Fire Ant\" spikes the loping soul of J Dilla with the stroboscopic vocal morsels of the Field; \"Sugarette\" wheezes and fumes like a Flying Lotus contraption. The music feels both spontaneous and precise, winding in complex syncopation around the one-beat, with subtle filter and tempo tweaks, and careful juxtapositions of texture (see the arid, throttled voices scraping against the sopping-wet chimes of \"Svive\"). Many songs taper off into ambient passages that have actual gravity, gluing the far-flung genres together. Its the kind of seamless variety, heady but visceral, that few electronic musicians who arent Four Tet have achieved.\nWhile Ambivalence Avenue is an excellent album by any measure, Bibio deserves extra credit for venturing outside of his established comfort zone. He began his musical career trying to emulate Steve Reich and Boards of Canada on no-fi equipment. He was fascinated by the physicality of media-- of degrading tape and malfunctioning recording gear. And he was interested in the natural world, letting the sounds of streams and rainshowers stand in for his own personality. Having depleted these ideas over the course of three solid albums, hes put them aside to do nearly the opposite. Ambivalence Avenue moves the focus from the flaws of media to their capacity for precision, and takes fewer cues from nature than from the urban sounds-- including Dilla and Madlib-- that Bibio admits discovering in recent years. By jettisoning a limiting aesthetic, he reveals his abilities to be startlingly vast, and one of our most predictable electronic musicians becomes a wild card.",

        "article_text": "Jon Hopkins is a respected keyboardist and sonic technician who instills ambient music and acidic techno with a classical sense of composition, but he tends to work around the edges of things: He got started backing Imogen Heap. Hes played keyboards for Brian Eno, a clear influence, on albums such as Small Craft on a Milk Sea. Tagging along with Eno, he wound up co-producing and performing on Coldplays fourth album. He also created subtle electro-acoustic atmospheres for the Scottish singer/songwriter King Creosote on the exquisite Diamond Mine EP, and crafted an acclaimed string-based score for the British sci-fi film Monsters. Its not a shabby CV, but its not quite a name-making one, either.\nThis habit of putting himself on the periphery seeped into his own albums-- until now. Insides from 2009 was impressive but felt faintly impersonal, streaming by like dazzling but disconnected vignettes in a film. But Hopkins breakthrough fourth album, Immunity, bounds and writhes with its own life force. Its looser and oilier, more limber and dangerous. The aggressive dance tracks darkly obliterate everything else, while the wet and sunny piano-ambient ones wash out into the sounds of wind, waves, and gulls. The latter is impeccably done on \"Sun Harmonics\", where the boundary between electronics and coastal recordings dissolves.\nLots of electronic music creates its own hermetic world, but on Immunity, Hopkins finds ingenious ways to let the world in. He created the albums warm, alive feel by shunning digital perfection in favor of the analog synthesis of original sounds, both electronic and physical. The ambient prelude of the haunting, scrambled glitch-house opener \"We Disappear\"-- a key unlocks the door of Hopkins London studio and his footsteps lead in-- is more than idle window dressing: He is ushering us into the tactile space that suffuses the record. He drums on desks, plays salt shakers, slows down serendipitous recordings of nearby fireworks, boosts the kick-drummed rattle of a window. On \"Form By Firelight\", which sounds like Kanye Wests \"Runaway\" remixed by Wolfgang Voigt, Hopkins processes beats and melodies right out of the piano, tapping the pedals and striking the strings. Spacious, with carefully shaped resonance, its delay-flickered counterpoint shows off Hopkins classical background.\nThis emphasis on our admission to a physical space naturally makes us feel like we have privileged access to Hopkins private emotional space as well. Immunity is said to be inspired by the arc of a night out, and whether or not that matters to the listener, it gives the album a holistic pace and flow, from heroically hurtling along on molten bass synthesziers to hovering gorgeously on gathering ambient breezes. Around the monstrous dancefloor anthems \"Open Eye Signal\" and \"Collider\"-- the first oozing forward in anticipation, the second climactically crashing down at sharp threshing angles-- there is the lyrical ambient landscape of \"Abandon Window\" and the cunning merger of both styles in \"Breathe This Air\". The title track, with a trickle of legato piano turning a rickety rhythm, brings back King Creosote to add discreet vocal colors for a dreamlike conclusion. It all adds up to a remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record that stays absorbing from beginning to end, and should finally catapult Hopkins to stardom in his own story.",

        "article_text": "Cyann \u0026 Ben, a four-piece based out of Charleville-Mézières in the French Ardennes and co-fronted by their namesake duo, might be likened to an unplugged version of their Gooom Records labelmates M83: both groups share an affinity for arpeggios, sweeping orchestration, and deep, resonant atmospherics, but where M83 drench their synth-centric shoegaze in bright electronic tones, Cyann \u0026 Ben prefer a live approach, resting their hushed vocals against darker, more organic instrumentation. The compositions on Spring, Cyann \u0026 Bens debut full-length, are tastefully restrained, yet often achieve epic heights through their cinematic, open-air production and full arrangements that sometimes recall the spacier efforts of Sigur Rós or the haunted, autumnal folk that lay beneath the layered feedback din on mid-period Flying Saucer Attack albums like Further and Chorus.\nOpener \"Buick to the Moon\" pulses deliberately amidst garbled, crackling audio samples from David Lynchs Wild at Heart, fluctuating madly between speakers. Two clean-toned electric guitars, floating on pillowy reverb, give shade to a ghostly melody. Atop this mesmeric mist hovers a soft male tenor with a female partner wading in and out of accompaniment. After a foreboding first few minutes, the song reaches its first climax on a surprisingly comforting melody spun out by a xylophone, guitar, and vocal trio. Its breathtaking, but just over the horizon, a darkness advances once again: Soon, drums enter the fray and renew the eerie conviction of the other instruments, which, now rhythmically unshackled, are free to challenge the tonal limitations of the songs first half. Its an incredibly promising track with which to open a debut record, and incredibly, Spring only gets better.\n\"I Cant Pretend Anymore\", perhaps the track that most inspired my earlier M83 comparison, launches into an intense 5/4 waltz after a beautiful female vocal solo noodles throughout an arpeggiated synthstring progression. A guitar carries on the arpeggio, offering still more internal energy to an already overwhelming backbeat that threatens to topple over itself at any moment. \"Siren Song\" drapes dangerously enchanting vocals over a whirlpool of cymbals, spelled-out guitar chords, and gorgeous synth tones, a guitar occasionally breaking free from the songs mysterious emotional vice grip. Accordions haunt \"A Dance with the Devil\" as a female vocal desperately struggles to keep her focus, distracted by her whispering lothario.\nSpring is an immediately accessible sonic feat, which is particularly striking given its extreme self-restraint. But its sweetest fruits are reaped only after repeated consideration, upon which one realizes the depth of complexity behind such initial immediacy. Its a rare strain of \"epic\" music, where bravado does not exceed the composition, but remains at all times within it. Cyann \u0026 Ben are masters of this subtlety, and, along with similar efforts this year from Englands George and the upcoming Books release, put forth once again the notion that the most convincing art is of a noble simplicity and a quiet grandeur.",

        "article_text": "For two decades, Glasgows indie-pop and dance music scenes have run in parallel, with only a few notable intersections; Chvrches are the latest meeting point. The Scottish trios debut LP, The Bones of What You Believe, is a seamless fusion of emotive theatrics, hook-loaded songwriting, and some of the more forward-thinking sonics in electronic music right now. Its a style that feels very of-the-moment: Chvrches embody what a generation raised on electronic music is looking for in a rock band, taking the danceable textures favored by the Electric Daisy set and applying them to the sweeping songcraft of M83 and Passion Pit.\nUnlike those those bands, Chvrches avoid guitars almost entirely, but the hooks on The Bones of What You Believe are indelible regardless of instrumentation, and the sound is immaculate. After Chvrches self-produced the album in band member Iain Cooks own Glasgow studio, big-deal boards guy Rich Costey (Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine) handled the mixing; his touch gives these tunes the bright clarity they deserve, with plenty of space for funhouse sonic triggers-- processed effects, pitched-down vocal samples, frizzy synth-pad textures. Every note sounds clean and sharp, a necessary corrective to the chemical-dipped wooziness that has dominated electronic indie pop in the last few years. \nThat sense of precision is unusual for a band this new, but Cook and Martin Doherty, who handle the majority of the instrumentation live and on record, are vets of Glasgows perpetually fertile indie scene. Cook handled guitars and programming as a member of defunct alt-leaning post-rockers Aereogramme, while Doherty was once a live member of throat-shredding shoegazers the Twilight Sad (who launched into their own synth excursions around the time that Chvrches became a full-time concern). Together they make music that complements distinctive vocalists without overshadowing them.\nHeard in the context of Glasgows still-strong cottage industry of distinctly masculine anguish-rock bands, the emotional palette of Chvrches lead singer Lauren Mayberry is a welcome change of pace. A local-band lifer who once pursued a career in music journalism, Mayberrys voice is a multifaceted instrument, the emotional kernel in Chvrches molecular makeup. She can sound cutting, aching, triumphant, fragile, and weightless, sometimes all at once; on \"Lies\", she soars above the chorus mountainous build, and her vocal surge rescues the murky techno of \"Science/Visions\", the closest thing to a miss on this otherwise rock-solid album.\nEven when Mayberrys at her most powerful, her voice possesses a specific, relatable humanity, which brightens the adolescent glow of her lyrics. (Occasional lead singer Doherty, previously the bands weak link, makes good enough on his two featured songs, the rippling \"Under the Tide\" and the prom-dance lushness of \"You Caught the Light\"). Her words might look overwrought on paper, but when set to the emotive sounds that Chvrches trade in, they sound towering, impassioned, and life-affirming. Depeche Mode, a spiritual antecedent, have a classic song with the refrain \"All I ever wanted/ All I ever needed/ Is here, in my arms\"; that kind of emotional directness and simplicity is a hallmark of the songwriting here.\nThe Bones of What You Believe also shares some of Depeche Modes large-scale ambition: the arpeggiated-synth burst that closes \"Tether\" sounds like it was orchestrated for the optimal turn-all-the-lasers-on-at-once trigger at a live performance, and its all the better for it. Throughout, Chvrches effortless populism finds them in a long tradition of bands who take a highly personal sense of turmoil and blow it up onto an arena-sized screen. Granted, recent live performances have suggested that they have a ways to go before their concert-conquering potential catches up with the ability they display on record, but such growing pains are normal for a band this new. For now, on record, Chvrches know how to go big on an intimate scale, to remind us of the stuff that keeps us living.",

        "article_text": "\"When can we hear some new material?,\" someone asked Kevin Shields in an AOL chat interview published by the San Francisco zine Cool Beans!. \"Definitely sometime this year or Im dead...\" he answered, later driving the point home with, \"I really am dead if I dont get my record out this year. Nobodys threatening me, BTW I just have to.\"\nThat chat took place exactly 16 years ago tomorrow and Kevin Shields is still alive. And now, almost 22 years after My Bloody Valentines last album, Loveless, we finally have that record. For those of us whose relationship to music and maybe even the act of hearing has been changed by Loveless, its hard to believe. Id grown comfortable with the idea that there would never be another My Bloody Valentine album. Even as recently as two months ago, I figured it would never happen. \"But he said it was mastered,\" people said to me. The last time a master of an MBV album was completed it took four years for it to come out. And that was music that had already been released. An alleged master of a new release? Plenty of time to pull the plug. But no, it happened, by surprise, last Saturday night. And many 403 errors later, we finally have this thing on our hard drives. mbv. 2013. This Is Our Bloody Valentine. \nLike a few people I know, I was initially afraid to listen, but there was no need to be. My Bloody Valentine have taken the precise toolkit of Loveless-- layered Fender Jaguar guitars made woozy through pedals and tremolo, hushed androgynous vocals way down in the mix-- and made another album with it, one that is stranger and darker and even harder to pin down. Where Loveless felt effortless, mbv strains, pushing at its boundaries with a sense of pensive gloom. If the guy spending all those years in the studio felt trapped by the experience, like the walls might be closing in and that he was dead if he didnt finish, the music here reflects it. mbv is an album of density with very little air or light. But it doesnt forgo the human touches that have made this band so special.\nThe nine-song mbv can be divided into thirds and the first three-song section, consisting of \"She Found Now\", \"Only Tomorrow\", and \"Who Sees You\", finds Shields exploring the untapped textural possibilities of the guitar. The last several years have been bad ones for the instrument. In independent music circles, the guitar has become synonymous with regression, a symbol used to evoke something from the past. And that might seem at first equally true here, since the tone of Shields guitar is so clearly connected to the sounds he pioneered two decades ago. But no one believes more deeply than Kevin Shields in the expressive power of the processed guitar, and the music here turns out to be more about feeling than style. \n\"She Found Now\" is an opener of daring subtlety, a ballad in the vein of \"Sometimes\" that consists mostly of deep strumming and Shields singing in a tone near a whisper. Theres a bit of percussion, a few more layers of distortion, but no announcement of anything earth-shattering or even particularly different. Its My Bloody Valentine making the kind of noises they invented and perfected. As the chords cycle through in the following \"Only Tomorrow\", Shields sets up a situation where the repetition and familiarity lulls you into a kind of trance and small gestures hit with great force. On \"Only Tomorrow\" that spine-tingling moment is a dead simple screeching high-end refrain that repeats toward the end, while on the following \"Who Sees You\", its a section halfway through where a rush of trebly chords coats the entire song in another layer of textured fuzz. When it comes to Shields and guitars, the small details do a tremendous amount of work. \nThe second trio of songs feature the lead vocals of My Bloody Valentine singer/guitarist Bilinda Butcher. The push and pull of her singing next to Shields is, along with the wavy \"glide guitar\" effect, My Bloody Valentines other defining characteristic. Their voices are the essence of the the bands strangely androgynous and non-specific sensuality. \"Is This and Yes\" is just Butchers voice and an unusual organ pattern that hangs in space at the end of the progression and never resolves itself; \"New You\" is the only track on the record that sounds even remotely like a single, and it shows that Shields melodic impulses have not left him.  \nIn another sense, \"New You\" points out how much has changed since MBV last released a full-length. In 1991, they were still a pop band, the kind that made videos and appeared on magazine covers and were on a fashionable record label. As such, there was at least some pressure for them to fit in, for their music to have context in the popular music landscape. So they released singles and probably hoped theyd become hits. Even if \"Soon\" had, as Brian Eno stated at the time, set a \"new standard,\" that didnt change that fact that it was in fact still pop. But those days are gone. My Bloody Valentine fit in exactly nowhere and the commercial expectations of a release like mbv are minimal. Whatever the cause, mbv is the weirdest album My Bloody Valentine have made by some margin. Some of the records otherworldly quality is up to frequency range. Theres very little on this album in the treble range but theres endless detail in the bass and mid, which makes the record feel more closed in and insular. But some of it is in the arc of the record. \nThrough the 1990s Kevin Shields often talked about jungle, what it meant to him, and how some of the ideas behind it were making their way into a new My Bloody Valentine album. He was not alone in this, but mixing drumnbass whooshing walls of percussion with oceanic shoegaze seemed a natural pairing (it was so natural, in fact, that artists like Third Eye Foundation beat Shields to the punch). Whether or not the final three songs on mbv are related to Shields experiments of that time, on mbv, where Shields presumably had time to make the drum parts he wanted, its clear that he doesnt really hear percussion the way most of us do. Drums are mostly distant, often muddy, serving as an underpinning or textural contrast to the guitar instead of driving the rhythm on their own. In this sense they mirror the 8-bit snatches of sound caught by crude samplers in the 90s. But since Isnt Anything, drums have been down on the list of concerns for MBV, which is one way the final third is so surprising and ultimately powerful. \n\"In Another Way\", another Butcher lead, begins to tilt the balance between noise and melodic beauty as the tempo increases, and by the following instrumental \"Nothing Is\" the mood has changed considerably. A track of heavy bass drums and pounding guitar, it feels militaristic and even a touch grim, with just faint glimmers of beauty inside the barrage. And then by the final \"Wonder 2\" the album has become something else. This is MBVs version of an album-closing \"L.A. Blues\"-like Stooges freak-out, where they stop worrying about structure and fill every inch of tape with noise. The heavy flanging evokes choppers buzzing overhead, and somehow, through it all, there are wispy voices, buried and being shoved around by the din. Its a disquieting end. Where Loveless, despite its complexity, sounded as natural as breathing, mbv sounds like the product of great effort, of meticulous work to get every sound in place. And that exertion is especially apparent in the final third, as Shields tries and ultimately succeeds in taking the project somewhere its never gone. All this work gives mbv its own quality, simultaneously intimate and detached. \nLike its predecessor, mbv feels like an album in part about love, but it approaches the grandest of human emotions from an unusual angle. Kurt Cobain, another iconic songwriter of the 1990s who never got a chance to grow old and figure out how to maintain his creativity in the wake of game-changing masterpieces, had a song called \"Aneurysm\" and it had a refrain that went, \"Love you so much, makes me sick.\" Thats how My Bloody Valentines deeply destabilizing queasiness, amplified here to a frightening degree, has always struck me: Theres a rush of feeling inside their music so intense it creates a kind of paralysis. Music swirls and moves in and out of phase, voices float by, half memory and half anticipation, and youre never quite sure how all the parts fit together. You get lost in it, and if youre wired a certain way that mixture of desire and confusion is easy to map on to the wider world. For 22 years, the only way to get there was through Loveless and its associated EPs; now theres another path, one many of us never expected to find. That its this successful in spite of it all is something we never had a right to expect.",

        "article_text": "Threading together occasionally disparate bits of 60s rock, garage, early punk, roots/bluegrass, Stax soul, and Southern gospel, Torontos Deadly Snakes have obviously spent the last few years scrounging around for more than just a ballsy album title. The bands classics-bin pinching has led to some magnificent ends: on Ode to Joy, the Snakes third release, theyve broken down and reassembled a centurys worth of musical output, and miraculously, emerged with something that sounds entirely, heartbreakingly relevant.\nWith all its wailing horns, weed-tinged organs, slammed guitars and throwdown vocals, Ode to Joy is, in a lot of ways, exactly what makes the 21st century such a potentially great time for rock music. Its a record that confirms, without getting excessively contemplative or buzzkill-cerebral, that synthesizing all the tunes and styles contemporary artists have at their disposal can actually be an inspired endeavor-- especially when you incorporate a hearty shot of ingenuity and some kicky Canuck spunk. Still, influence/inspiration theories aside, it would be unfair not to acknowledge that theres a little bit of love buried in here, too.\nBecause ultimately, its the Snakes earnest (and somehow palpable) appreciation for the work of their forefathers that makes Ode to Joys overstated lineage so tolerable. Just imagine six kids getting so sincerely riled up about their respective record collections that they were left with no choice but to join forces and actually follow through on the wild, heart-in-throat urges weve all had to just squish every record worth loving into one big, satisfying ball of sound. And then to run around as fast as possible, clutching that craggy conglomeration tightly to our chests, breathing hard. And then to name that thing Ode to Joy.\nBut before you get too misty-eyed, remember that Ode to Joy is also an explosive, knee-bending kick in the pants, and that the record comes with its fair share of fiendish snickering and behind-your-back finger-pointing. The Snakes wide-ranging influences might make Ode to Joy stylistically unpredictable, but its far from disjointed; rather, the record follows its own kind of in-joke logic, and, expectedly, the Snakes private schematic includes a healthy dose of impish rollick. Happily, Ode to Joy has the sort of mischievous swagger that, unlike some of the bands \"garage rock revival\" peers, is a little bit off-balance, far more playful than patronizing. And its that roguish spirit that unites these tracks into a glorious whole.\nAppropriately, theres no awkward throat clearing-- Ode to Joy blows right open on \"Closed Casket\", a loud, freewheeling assault that sees vocalist Andre Ethier bravely slamming down words and grunts with a seething, bang-it-out syntax that captures, almost perfectly, Dylans thick \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" ramble. Its a curious choice for an opener, because Ethier sounds so stupidly similar to Dylan that, inevitably, some people are just gonna snicker, roll their eyes and walk away-- unless, of course, theyve already been sold by the boisterous bluster of his five able bandmates, who crank out rowdy, foot-stomping drum beats (the impressive Andrew Gunn behind the kit), jangly piano lines, and rough, garage-punk guitar riffs.\nAnother highlight, \"Oh My Bride\" sees that same spirit applied to an otherwise traditional gospel cut, with only guitar, handclaps, and some soulful, listen-up hollering, while \"Burn Down the Valley\" uses the Snakes fervor to harness the creepier side of an organ, mixing dark, rolling lines with back and forth vocals, spreading it all out over a bass-heavy, nightmarish stew. The Deadly Snakes are that rarest of bands whose approach to rock n roll is not only fierce and dynamic, but also fueled by an insatiable passion, and yet Ode to Joy has been criminally overlooked for most of the spring and summer-- mostly for lack of a solid publicity team. But records like Ode to Joy cant be held back, and lately, theres been a rumble underground. Right now, its seeming increasingly unlikely that it could go unnoticed any longer-- its just that good.",

        "article_text": "Issued in Scandinavia on Service (Jens Lekman, Studio), the Tough Alliances early EPs introduced an electro-pop duo capable of covering both 50 Cent and C-86-era Primal Scream, replying to Daft Punks \"Teachers\", recording could-be Top 40 singles, and spiking an optimistic love song with the words, \"I dont give a flying fuck.\" TTA finally made inroads in the U.S. and Canada this summer when Montreal-based Summer Lovers Unlimited (Crystal Castles, Teenagers) reissued 2006s New Waves EP, which featured the shiny tropical wistfulness of \"Silly Crimes\". Soon the wonderful A New Chance-- which landed in Sweden this May via TTAs own Sincerely Yours imprint-- will join it, providing the best introduction yet to this singular group. (Summer Lovers also plans to issue the groups 2005 album, The New School.)\nAt barely more than half an hour, A New Chance may lack heft, but its the purest expression so far of Swedens ongoing pop hybridization. Lekman, who samples TTA on his stunning new Night Falls Over Kortedala, has called the Gothenburg duo his favorite Swedish band; they share the crooners Jonathan Richman-oriented wonder and a willingness to plunder for inspiration. Through their Sincerely Yours label, theyre connected to-- and have elements in common with-- Air Frances island beatscapes, the aggressively tender stadium-twee of the Honeydrips, the Embassys digital perfection, the Fields poignant nu-trance, and the yearning of former Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman (Taken by Trees).\nEx-Pitchfork staffer Pete Macia over at The Fader recently compared TTA to Public Image Ltd. if John Lydon had gone pop rather than parodying it, and hes right. But where Lydon went for dub and \"Death Disco\", Eric Berglund, who sings for TTA, and Henning Fürst, who handles the music, opt for beach-party sonics and fuck-you optimism. Opener \"Something Special\" assures us were worthwhile, while single \"First Class Riot\" offers some decidedly un-rocknroll advice: \"Dont you die yet.\" \"Miami\" matches bright acoustic strums to rave-era beats and the vocal hook to EQs \"Total Ecstasy\". The dazzling title track imagines \"a place where diamonds never fade away,\" but it has almost as many pitch-shifted vocal blips and wild-animal whoops as tingly keyboards, banana-boat bass lines, and spiky guitars.\nLike fellow electro-pop provocateurs DAF or the KLF, TTA frequently test the bounds of what they can get away with. \"We got our own jihad if you know what I mean,\" they once sang, although the muezzin-like cries that bookend the album are as political as they get here. Lip-synched live shows and a proclivity for swinging baseball bats on stage have caused some controversy at home, which the duo address directly on \"Neo Violence\": \"Truly sorry, thought youd get the wink.\"\nOn the Sincerely Yours website, Berglund and Fürst write about \"something capable of transforming everyday existence into something strange and wonderful.\" Throughout A New Chance, the duo searches for an unspecified, elusive \"something,\" that ranges from \"something bright and pure\" (\"First Class Riot\") to \"That soul/ That cant be bought or sold\" (\"Looking for Gold\") to \"something that moves us tonight\" (\"The Last Dance\"). Somewhere within pops gaudy artifice-- Britney at the VMAs and \"American Idol\", sure, but also the contrived authenticity of so much folk and rock-- there remains, this music argues, the possibility for sincere expression. When the album ends, this may seem like just a dream: \"Still in my bed, its all in my head,\" Berglund concludes on \"1981 -\".",

        "article_text": "Yes, it exists, and yes, its as good as fans have been hoping for. Well get more in depth on that shortly, but with the two most important questions surrounding this album finally answered after four years of anticipation, that leaves a third one: why a sequel? The easy conclusion is that Raekwon needed a benchmark-- that he couldnt just put together any slapdash collection of skits and weedcarrier features and b-grade beats, then slap the words Cuban Linx on the cover. So while some people might read this albums title as a gimmicky hook to lure in bring-NYC-back nostalgists, it actually acts more as a reassuring seal of quality from an MC who some people think lost his way the moment he released Immobilarity without a single RZA beat.\nThe connections to Cuban Linxs roots of grimy, Mafioso opulence run deep here, starting with a partial reprise of the original albums closer \"North Star (Jewels)\" as Pt. IIs opening track. In 1995, Popa Wu admired the way Raekwon was growing and coming up in the world in the same way a master teacher regards his star pupil; 14 years later hes simultaneously marveling at Raekwons success and warning him of the treachery that elevated status brings. From there we get not so much a single narrative as a vivid overview of a criminal empire thats grown in scope since the first Cuban Linx. Raekwons gift for deep focus-- homing in on an adversarys apparel one moment, zooming out to take in an entire hoods social system the next-- is at its sharpest, and in running the gamut of criminology rap from kitchen stove to prison yard, he reinforces his reputation as a lyricist with a supreme ability to simultaneously set an evocative scene and turn a slick phrase.\nTwo early detail-oriented highlights come back-to-back: \"Sonnys Missing\", a compact, Pete Rock-produced narrative concerning the grotesque interrogation of a rival segues into the strangely calm crack-cooking setpiece \"Pyrex Vision\", where Rae simmers his voice down to a murmur and gives a tactile snapshot of the crack-cooking process. That mixture of tightly knit procedural storytelling and lyrical virtuosity carries through on the other solo showpieces, the business plan/inventory rundown \"Surgical Gloves\" and the confrontation with a kiss-blowing, shit-talking Jamaican dealer in \"Fat Lady Sings\" chief amongst them.\nBut its the guest spots that make the album widescreen, particularly with the involvement of every remaining Wu-Tang member (except for U-God, possibly as a canonical continuation of his being \"killed off\" on the first Cuban Linx). Inspectah Deck, Masta Killa, and GZA bolster the narrative, Method Man provides a couple respites from the criminal theme with some flat-out vintage lyrical boasting on early-leak highlights \"New Wu\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\", and the the RZA has a memorably unhinged cameo at the end of \"Black Mozart\". Even ODBs there in spirit, with the Dilla-utilizing \"Ason Jones\" cutting through all the mythologized goofball eccentricity to depict him as a wise man with real love in his heart. All that, and you get Jadakiss and Styles P waxing grimy on \"Broken Safety\", Beanie Sigel at his remorseful best on \"Have Mercy\", Slick Rick pulling diabolical Queen-mocking hook duty on \"We Will Rob You\", and Busta Rhymes dialing down his characteristic bellow to growl on \"About Me\".\nAnd then theres Ghost. Maybe the biggest strength of the original Cuban Linx was how well Ghostface and Raekwon complemented each other, with Tony Starks rampaging wail underscoring Chefs calculating intensity, and Ghosts appearances here hold that same power. He opens his verse on \"Cold Outside\" with one of his most evocatively disturbing lines ever-- \"They found a two-year-old strangled to death/ With a Love Daddy shirt on/ In a bag on the top of the steps\"-- and expands that into a ball-of-confusion breakdown of friends betrayals, AIDS mothers, \"swastikas on the church,\" being broke during Christmas, and the need for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Later on, he has a sharp back-and-forth dialogue-style prison-hustle account with Rae in \"Penitentiary\", castigates a street soldier after being caught getting a blowjob from the mans girlfriend in \"Gihad\", and has a classic outrageous-swagger line in \"10 Bricks\": \"the currency rushes like poppin a wheelie/ Holdin a bike with one hand, the other countin the billies\". Listening to him going R\u0026B on Wizard of Poetrys gonna be weird after this.\nThat said, theres one crucial difference between the two Cuban Linx records that couldve tripped this album up: The switch from an all-RZA palette of beats to an all-star roster of production names. RZA does contribute three of the best tracks-- the fuzzed-out cinema funk of \"Black Mozart\", the choral headknock sway of \"New Wu\", and the lavish, orchestral mid-70s soul of \"Fat Lady Sings\"-- which fall between his classic first-wave style and a less out-there strain of the experimentation that alienated Ghost and Raekwon circa 8 Diagrams. But aside from Dr. Dre getting a bit too polished and joylessly glossy on the faux-Latin cheese of \"Catalina\" and the plodding \"About Me\", the rest of the production proves to be an eclectic yet fitting take on the classic Wu-Tang aesthetic. \"House of Flying Daggers\", \"Ason Jones\", and \"10 Bricks\" benefit from a trip to the Dilla vaults that brought back three of his most RZA-esque beats. The Alchemists chopped-up chimes and woozy guitars give \"Surgical Gloves\" a hypnotic edge. Pete Rock maintains the integrity of his style with the flute and horn-driven bounce on \"Sonnys Missing\" (repurposed from NYs Finest track \"Questions\" and an even better fit here). And Marley Marl gets a lot of atmospheric mileage out of the subdued yet gripping guitar loop that comprises the 55 seconds of \"Pyrex Vision\".\nBetween the hype, the anticipation and the attachment of a legendary albums legacy, anything less than a classic would have proven to be a major disappointment. Few albums have gone through this much turmoil and delay in the planning stages yet turned out so cohesive and tight. The last time a Wu-Tang record came together with this kind of personnel and succeeded under a grand conceptual vision, we got Fishscale, and calling Cuban Linx II Raekwons equivalent to it isnt out of the question. Like Ghostfaces modern classic, this album defies hip-hops current atmosphere of youthful cockiness and aging complacency: instead, its driven by the sometimes celebratory, sometimes traumatized sense of stubborn survival and perseverance, a veteran mindset that can no longer picture success without having to defend it. Consider this a triumphant defense.",

        "article_text": "The War on Drugs’ 2011 album Slave Ambient saw perpetual unease as a Zen state: bandleader Adam Granduciel’s ruminations on restlessness read like a veritable prescription for Xanax, but the psychedelia-smeared country-rock enveloping his words was all, like, “No worries, dude.” The War on Drugs’ third album, however, presents no easy remedy for his inner turmoil. If the mesmerizing motorik hum of Slave Ambient gave Granduciel an outlet to escape his problems, Lost in the Dream is where he pulls a U to survey the emotional wreckage. While his former War on Drugs compadre Kurt Vile is forever Waking on a Pretty Daze, Granduciel has been sleepless through some ugly nights.\nAs detailed in a recent Grantland feature, Lost In the Dream was the product of a grueling, year-long recording process. Though Granduciel involved his touring band more so than any previous War on Drugs record, his perfectionist tendencies still held sway, resulting in endless cycles of recording, revising, and scrapping. And such self-doubt wasn’t helped by the fact that Granduciel was recovering from the flame-out of a long-term relationship, the ashes of which are scattered all over his lyric sheet here. But the obsessiveness and insecurity pay off massively on Lost in the Dream—this is the War on Drugs’ most lustrous, intricately detailed, and beautifully rendered record to date. In essence, the War on Drugs have evolved as a band on an album-to-album basis in precisely the same fashion as so many of their songs: what at first seemed like a fairly straightforward, traditionalist roots-rock exercise has very gradually, very subtly blossomed into something wondrous and profound.\nLost in the Dream continues down the Slave Ambient route of bridging polar-opposite strains of 1980s rock—namely, the tremulous haze of late-era Spacemen 3 and the sort of flyover-state Americana anthems used to sell pick-up trucks. But even in the album’s opening seconds, the new album asserts itself as a more urgent affair—overtop the blurry, break-of-dawn guitar ripples of “Under the Pressure”, a stuttering drum machine sounds off like an alarm clock coaxing you out of bed and prodding you out the door. And if the steady-pulsed melody that emerges initially positions “Under the Pressure” as the most placid song about anxiety ever, by the third chorus run—at which point it’s amassed a swirl of dueling guitar solos, starburst synths, and brown-note saxophone swells—you feel the full weight of this nine-minute track bearing down on your chest.\nThis tension is inescapable. Whether it’s the hair-raising, Autobahn-blazing charge of “An Ocean In Between the Waves” or the Positively South Street sway of “Eyes of the Wind”, Granduciel’s litany of worries are laid bare here, free of any textural interference or obfuscation. And the comparatively direct lyrics mirror the new approach to incorporating some of Granduciel’s more unfashionable influences. As ever, totemic figures like Dylan and Springsteen cast a long shadow over the War on Drugs’ terrain, but Granduciel is the sort of classic-rock purist who wore out the grooves of those artists’ most canonical albums so long ago that he now finds fresher inspiration in their less lauded 80s discography.\nPeriod sounds abound: “Red Eyes” is what would happen if Springteen’s simmering “I’m on Fire” was actually set aflame; “Burning” finds its fuse in the buoyant keyboard riff to Rod Stewart’s 1981 new-wave novelty “Young Turks”; the melancholic mid-album meditation “Disappearing” sounds like the synth-powered rhythm track of Tears for Fears’ “Pale Shelter” on a codeine drip. And the preponderance of glistening piano chords on this record suggests Granduciel is not one to touch his dial whenever Bruce Hornsby’s “The Way It Is” pops up on his local oldies station.\nBut if Lost in the Dream is unapologetic in its dad-rock reverence, it’s dad-rock for people who are too fucked up and broken to even think of having kids. (As he sings on “The Ocean In Between the Waves”: “I’m in my finest hour/ Can I be more than just a fool?”) In sharp contrast to, say, recent efforts to liberate Dylan’s 80s output from its dated production, Granduciel’s songs are left to fidget and squirm within the claustrophobic sonic confines and synthetic sheen. In his hands, these echoes of the past ultimately emphasize the uncertainty of his future, those shiny surfaces representing the good life that seems forever out of reach.\nAnd besides, on Lost in the Dream, the most crucial details are found in its structural mutations. The album is loaded with songs whose greatness is revealed slowly, where the simplest, most understated chord change can blow a track wide open and elevate it from simply pretty to absolutely devastating. Note the shift that occurs two minutes and 50 seconds into “Suffering”, where the pent-up despondency heard in Granduciel’s state-of-his-union address (“Why we here when we’re both gonna fake it?”) is unleashed in a crying jag of drizzling piano chords and gently weeping White Album-like guitar slides. Or in the midst of the album’s epic break-up-ballad finale, “In Reverse”,­ you realize that all of the angst and ache that went into the song, and the album’s creation as a whole, is just building to the moment of release provided by the big, shoulder rub of an acoustic-guitar riff that appears out of nowhere at the 5:13 mark. They’re the sort of perfect little touches that effectively translate Granduciel’s private hurt into communal catharsis—and reify Lost in the Dream as an immaculately assembled portrait of a man falling apart.",

        "article_text": "The English live on an island, have national radio, and they had the Smiths and the Stone Roses. As a result, theyre less embarrassed than Americans to dream of indie guitar bands commanding decent audiences. Thats part of what Bloc Party frontman Kele Okerere seems to have in mind when he describes this album as \"Technicolor.\" He means it has big sound, big hooks, energetic performances, ambition-- all the things that make rock bands sound skilled and confident. He means no messing around, no interludes or experiments. He means the kind of guitar record where every song wants to be as tight as the singles; the kind that wants to be worth every penny any lawn-mowing pre-teen might spend on it. Because according to him, nobody makes that kind of record anymore.\nThat isnt true-- and the last thing anyone wants is for U2 to try harder-- but he has a point; its no accident that there are people who think Radiohead havent really delivered since The Bends. Put it like that, and what Bloc Party actually sound like drops pretty low on the list of things you need to know about Silent Alarm. What perhaps matters most is that theyre trying to make one of those clean, consistent, ambitious Popular Guitar Rock albums-- and depending on how much stock you put in that kind of thing, theyve done a great job of it. This is a solid, intelligent album that a lot of people will love-- one thatll slot onto indie-crossover CD racks right beside the debuts from Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads.\nLead single \"Banquet\" is wonderfully tight and energetic-- the same kind of spiffy half-dancing rock as Franz Ferdinands \"Take Me Out\" or Duran Durans \"Planet Earth\". Thats easy to pull off when youve got a drummer this good, and a bassist that locks in with him so neatly, whether its for rock charge or disco hustle. That, in fact, has been Bloc Partys main selling point, apart from the whole Remarkably Competent thing: When the rhythm section stretches its limbs, they leap a good distance away from the straight-ahead eighth-note riffing of the others in this game. Filter in their timely post-punk moves, Bunnymen gestures, and pop ambitions, and you start to feel like this is what it might have been like to listen to the Police or XTC in the early 80s; the sound of a straight-up rock band just a shade more sophisticated, and a little more interested in rhythm, than most of their peers.\nAnd of course the opener, \"Like Eating Glass\", is even grander and snappier than \"Banquet\", as if to promise from the start that these guys take your purchase seriously. The songwriting is simple in style (forward rhythm, tidy hooks, guitars) but smart in detail-- all stops and starts, bridges and breakdowns, firework flourishes and tasteful studio tweaks. Even more striking are the precision and sheer good taste of the performances: Its not so easy to show off within the confines of songs this focused, but these guys seem to manage just fine.\nSo you get all the usual scrubbed-up gifts: the slower song, the slower song that turns into a faster one, the one with the studio effects, the one with the handclaps. A lot of this material is surprisingly scripted, as if someone spent whole nights in the practice space trying to get a two-bar guitar transition to work Just So. Okerere has a voice thats weirdly similar to the singer from the long-forgotten Adorable, with whom Bloc Party share a hell of a lot more than an appreciation for the Bunnymen: Its a vaguely-strangled back-of-throat thing that lets him moan and shout with refreshing gusto when the band gets going. (Typically ambitious topics of moaning: other people, culture war, girls and society and stuff.) The voice weakens a bit when he needs to croon, but crooning isnt really the point here. Bloc Party can be pretty, even sappy, but theyre never looking to be atmospheric; they can rock, but theyre never looking to whip up dark drama. This album charges happily down the center-- it shakes its hips now and then, and it whispers here and there, but it always seems to come back to tight and bouncy.\nPeople will love this record. And so, inevitably, the people who dont love it will start complaining. And when they complain, theyll point out that this is just a regular-old rock album, full of all the current stylish rock-album tricks. And theyll be absolutely right; at worst, Bloc Party are like one of those people who are so well-groomed that its hard to remember exactly what they look like. But really, a complaint like that misses something: Being a good ol unchallenging rock band is this outfits whole point-- and their biggest strength.\n ",

        "article_text": "Ive heard Dave Longstreth cursed at length, and Ive heard him compared to some of the lesser deities. In the Dirty Projectors frontman we have a fellow who fancies himself not so much a songwriter as a modern composer, a Yale grad with one of indie rocks most divisive voices. Early DPs records carry with them ambitions so grandiose its no wonder they range from wildly inventive to practically unlistenable-- occasionally in the span of the same song.\nThen there was 2007s Rise Above, which saw Longstreth and company misremembering the hell out of Black Flags Damaged by slathering embellishment onto one of the most gloriously unadorned LPs ever. It wasnt exactly a gimmick, but-- and I say this as a fan of both of those records-- it wasnt all that far from one. In spite of its comparatively light tone and the bands tight clutch on melody and rhythm, it was art-damaged and, to some, impenetrable. However you sized it up, you had to admit it was intriguing, even if your interest level waned with every passing yelp. This has heretofore been the story of Dirty Projectors: a band so brainy, so good at the very particular thing they do, they can be hard to like.\nNow comes Bitte Orca, the bands best, and certainly most likable, album by a mile. Bitte doesnt actually switch up the Rise Above formula that much: Intricate (if roomier) full-band arrangements abound, Longstreth largely sticks with his clear King Sunny Ade-meets-Jimmy Page guitar acrobatics, and hes still singing his strange, loping songs with that voice. But it whittles down the jarring time signatures and off-kilter arrangements and vocal bleats (er, for the most part) to create a triumphant art-pop record destined to please longtime fans and win him a whole slew of new ones. The key is that, rather surprisingly, Bitte Orca is one of the more purely enjoyable indie-rock records in an awfully long time; remarkable by any means, but even moreso considering the source. Its breezy without a hint of slightness, tuneful but with its fair share of tumult, concise and inventive and replayable and plain old fun. It is the sound of Longstreth the composer and Longstreth the pop songwriter finally settling on a few things together after years of tug-of-war between the two.\nThere are some triumphant standalone songs in the DPs back catalogue-- \"Fucked For Life\", \"I Will Truck\", and \"Rise Above\" spring to mind-- but never has Longstreth laid nine of them out in a row, as he does on Bitte Orca. From the chiming opening chords of \"Cannibal Resource\" to the supple swivel that closes \"Fluorescent Half-Dome\", theres a forward motion at play when you spin Bitte Orca all the way through, but its an album of such a high uniform quality and such indelible range, practically any tune could be your favorite. Songs run the gamut from Zeppelin III-style swirl (sorta-title-track \"Useful Chamber\") to delicate balladry (\"Two Doves\", a dead ringer for Nicos cover of Jackson Brownes \"These Days\" and no less gorgeous for it) to R\u0026B bob-and-weave (\"Stillness Is the Move\", which owes a great debt to the dearly departed Aaliyah-Timbaland braintrust) to adult-contemporary pop (no shots, \"No Intention\"). Apart from the ultimately transitional whoosh of the brief \"The Bride\", the run from \"Cannibal Resource\" to \"No Intention\" is as solid and variegated a display of songwriting acumen and instrumental virtuosity as any youll hear this year. But it sure doesnt feel as heavy as that sentence might have you believe.\nI dont dare pick one highlight-- hell, my favorites keep changing-- but Ill point to \"Useful Chamber\" as the best encapsulation of what Bitte Orca does so well. A woozy synth line underpins one of Longstreths gentlest vocal performances to date, a melody line I find myself singing in all sorts of inopportune places. Roughly halfway through, the beat breaks, Longstreth half-raps a little pre-chorus pep talk, and the song explodes in sound and vision. I dont quite understand what Longstreth is going for with the songs whale-plea mantra, but when it sounds like this-- so gigantic, so effortless, so unbelievably catchy-- I could really give a fuck. Its pure bliss, tension that results in glorious release. And while the song-- like the album it features on-- sacrifices precious little of the art-pop leanings of Longstreths past work, hes traded obfuscation for overtness on nearly all levels, channeled his frenetic energy into paring down the songwriting as opposed to putting it all into the performances, and the results positively sing.\nIm only slightly less enamored of Bitte Orcas final twofer than I am with what precedes it, though either would be a clear highlight on any of the other DPs albums. \"Remade Horizon\" starts a bit slow and Longstreths voice seems a tad strained on the verse melody; despite an ebullient shoutalong chorus, it seems more an excuse for the impressive feat of vocal pummelhorsery from Amber Coffman and Angel Deradoorian in its second half than it does a tunes tune like the seven that come before it. Its the first time on Bitte Orca Longstreth allows chops to stand out in front of the song, and while its neat to hear them pull it off (and is an absolute marvel in a live setting), it feels showy in a way Bitte Orca otherwise avoids in favor of direct hits. The emphasis on Coffman and Deradoorians vocals throughout is one of the best things about the record; \"Horizon\" just happens to be the one moment they seem overused-- a problem of arrangement, really-- and it suffers a bit for it.\n\"Fluorescent Half Dome\" has the opposite problem; its a bit too simplistic getting going and doesnt quite earn its bizarre chorus. While, like most songs here, it picks up when Coffman and Deradoorian start in with their vocals, its not quite the closer a record like this deserves. But even focusing on relative difficulty among tracks on the record seems odd: Jaw-dropping virtuosity was the best thing the DPs had going for them prior to Bitte Orca. Here, it stands behind so many other newly apparent strengths-- a testament to the leaps and bounds Longstreth has made as a songsmith and Dirty Projectors have made as a band.",

        "article_text": "Never underestimate the power of the perfect guitar effects unit. The Jesus and Mary Chains landmark Psychocandy would have sounded vastly less godlike without its use of a discontinued (and allegedly broken) Japanese fuzz pedal. Dinosaur Jr.s J Mascis dredged his mythic decibel levels from road-worn Marshall amps, but his stoner racket wouldnt have been the same if he hadnt funneled it through the grinding fury of a Big Muff. In the right hands, one little black box can mean the difference between pummeling and decimating.\nFew people understand this better than Oliver Ackermann, frontman for thunderous Brooklyn three-piece A Place to Bury Strangers: Under his catch-all company name Death by Audio (its also a music venue, recording studio, and collective), he custom-builds and designs his own hand-wired pedals, which are used by everyone from Lightning Bolt and Serena Maneesh to Wilco, Spoon, and TV on the Radio. Not coincidentally, anyone looking for a quick description of his own band can look to the names he gives these things: Interstellar Overdriver, Supersonic Fuzz Gun, Total Sonic Annihilation.\nWith a bandname thats linked to both the Gospel of Matthew and the writings of British occultist Aleister Crowley, A Place to Bury Strangers represents something of a second coming for Ackermann. He was previously a member of defunct Fredericksburg, Va., dream-pop revivalists Skywave, whose records were all but baptized in the drones of (dont jump out of your checkered Vans!) the JAMC and My Bloody Valentine. After their breakup, Skywaves remaining members formed the like-minded two-piece Ceremony, and Ackermann moved to New York where he hooked up with drummer Jay Space and bassist Jono Mofo, turned up the volume, and began masterminding the wrecking-crew colossus that would become this album.\nCompiling mastered versions of the bands early CD-Rs and mp3s, A Place to Bury Strangers self-titled debut LP sets tinnitus-inducing noise-pop against a tension-wracked Joy Division-meets-Ministry backdrop. Plenty of bands have tapped the trebly, ecstatic side of shoegaze in recent years, but none have imbued it with this bands frustrated aggression or lacerating feedback.\nWhat hits first is the reverberating distortion: The brutal textures announce themselves in pangs of blown-out guitar, crunching against the propulsive bassline and distant, static-soaked drums of opening track \"Missing You\". Thirty seconds in, the tempest recedes, revealing the songs love-wasted verses and murky, chiming guitars (think the Chills \"Pink Frost\" and youre close), only to sneak up again for a shattered, metal-twisting chorus. The groups versatile squall can crumble majestically, as on the slow-motion starfighter explosions of \"The Falling Sun\", or growl like a wounded mountain lion, as during the pitch-shifting tumult of \"My Weakness\". And on \"To Fix the Gash in Your Head\", it even evokes the late-80s peak of Wax Trax! industrial bands, fleshed out by treble-heavy synth, buzzsaw guitars, and primitive, pre-programmed drum loops.\nFor a dude creating such awesome bedlam, Ackermanns uneven monotone comes off Ian Curtis-bummed. The hammering, Factory Records-esque beats and blistering effects-pedal descent of \"She Dies\" take place on a \"white-letter day\" (\"Theres nothing for me now,\" Ackermann wearily intones). Finale \"Ocean\" barely glimpses its basslines steady shore through waves of resigned heartbreak. But the epic atmospheres are rarely as dense as I might be letting on. What matters most is the substance behind the style, and here, even morose falling-out songs like \"Another Step Away\" are saturated with slender indie-pop melody, notwithstanding the occasional weak lyric about how theres \"no photograph that can capture who you are\" (totally rhymes with \"shooting star\").\nA Place to Bury Strangers can pull beauty out of eardrum-puncturing bleakness, but the most tuneful offering here, \"Dont Think Lover\", is gentle and romantic-- when not exploding at the seams. \"Dont think lover/ Love lasts forever,\" Ackermann sings, and its never quite clear whether the sentiment is optimistic or misanthropic. The stalking \"I Know Ill See You\" seems to play off the know-my-love-too-well urgency of the Smiths \"Hand in Glove\", with Ackermann even warning, \"Dont take my hand/ Cause Ill take it away.\" Like the Italians Do It Better labels similarly moody After Dark compilation, A Place to Bury Strangers may not be easy for would-be record buyers to find-- its currently limited to 500 copies and put out by, um, Killer Pimp Records-- but its worth every effort.",

        "article_text": "Hard to believe its been two years since Polysics unleashed their Stateside debut, Hey! Bob! My Friend!, but their triumphant return couldnt have come at a better time. Released to critical fanfare (particularly from your pals at Pitchfork) but criminally overlooked by the indie masses, Hey! Bob! hit just ahead of the cusp of the 80s resurgence-- roughly a year before the genres the band holds so dear (new-wave, no-wave, electro) were embraced by every hipster with a gaggle of Contortions records and a jones for hot-pink. A shame, too, as that records brilliantly unhinged Devo-via-Japanoise deconstructionist ditties are still head and shoulders above most of the art-punk flotsam thats been released since.\nIntent to stay one full step ahead of the rest of the world-- or more likely just too hyper to sit still-- Polysics have forged ahead with Neu, now rocking a style one might describe as \"abrasive electronic post-punk.\" The influence of the records namesake is conspicuously absent this time around (it was only mildly detectable on the last record, with the exception of some distinctly motorik drumming); the band has instead opted to expose more of its no-wave roots: Neu hiccups and jerks in a manner more consistent with Polysics U.S. contemporaries than any of avant-prog/psych-rock shredders more commonly associated with their homeland. In fact, tracks like the dizzying \"MS-17\" and the completely ballistic guitar frenzy of \"Urge On!\" place them in the same ballpark as Williamsburgs current cream-of-the-crop.\nMore than any other current act, Polysics display not just the desire, but also the deranged nervous energy and raw talent, to inherit the spaz-rock throne left vacant by 90s Moog-core heroes (and fellow Devo enthusiasts) Brainiac. \"Xct\"s bizarre synth squiggles, vocoder interjections, and delirious vocalizations conjure the ghost of the dearly departed Timmy Taylor, while \"X-Rays (This is My Life)\" absolutely nails that familiar Brainiac hip-shake groove.\nBut Polysics arent leaving without turning their own unique signatures into trademarks. \"Making Sense\", all preening vocals and \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\"-style synths, is Neus poppiest highlight: with radioactive blurts and choppy digibeat accents taking its pummeling drum fills and overdriven guitar riffs hostage, it updates and reinvents the brightest moments of the New Romantic era with more charisma and creativity than any club full of electroclashing fashionista goons could ever hope to. And \"What\", the albums sole downtempo track, sits on a laid-back groove encrusted with familiar vocodered vocals, providing a brief abeyance from the rest of the albums raving-mad paroxysms.\nDespite this records spazcore conviction-- the antithesis of traditional, hipster-defined \"cool\"-- Neu rages and rants in total style. Todays musical climate is far more hospitable toward this kind of rampant, maniacal depravity, and with the albums beefed-up, more varied, and generally more rock nature updating Hey! Bob!s nerdy new-wavisms, Polysics are destined for the top of the neo-no-wave heap. Heres hoping Neu wont go unnoticed.",

        "article_text": "On both record and onstage, the Walkmen have always reached for the rafters-- often at the risk falling on their collective faces or completely overshadowing their moodier material. In the light of their previous powerful singles and go-for-broke performances, the New York bands latest album, You \u0026 Me, might seem like a step down. However, its the first that fully commits to their seductive, eminently soused-sounding late night sulk. If there are people who still consider the Walkmen a singles act-- granted, that will happen when you write a couple of the best rock singles of the decade-- You \u0026 Me might finally convince them otherwise.The album begins with a whimper-- the tentative patter of \"Donde Esta la Playa\" followed by instrumental \"Flamingos (for Colbert)\"-- but theres one striking, early difference between this record and all their previous work: You can make out what singer Hamilton Leithauser is saying. Its a good thing, too; among hazy tales of reckless vacations, the albums most vivid tracks are often its most lyrically straightforward: \"Red Moon\" is about missing a girl, \"The Blue Route\" is about missing better days.\nThose are simple, well-worn topics, but nearly all of these songs are buoyed by some small, cautious detail that-- while it might sound slight on paper-- make for indelible musical moments: The woodsy whistling on \"On the Water\", the horns that make \"Red Moon\" gorgeously mopey, or the warm hum of organ and harp-like piano fills on \"Long Time Ahead of Us\". Elsewhere, the fantastic, clattering percussion on \"Postcards From Tiny Islands\", \"Four Provinces\", and more reaffirm drummer Matt Barrick is the bands MVP.Moreover, these songs refine old ideas scattered throughout the Walkmens catalog, mostly building them into stronger tracks than their predecessors: \"Red Moon\" takes the ostentatious horns from \"Louisiana\" (from 2006s A Hundred Miles Off) and use them as essential pieces of atmosphere and mood. The loping guitar and offbeat drumming of \"Look Out the Window,\" from their 2002 split EP with Calla, are folded into the late-game clincher \"The Blue Route\". Here, all the bands wanderings coalesce with more focused lyrics and assured songwriting, neither racing nor shuffling towards its ambiguous climax. With all the elements of a Perfect Walkmen Song-- cavernous echo, stinging guitars and straining organ, vocals where you can hear the veins on Leithausers temples bulge-- it would easily fit on the bands peak, Bows + Arrows.You \u0026 Me isnt as hard or immediate as the bands earlier records, but thats not a complaint; its sound is coy, and invites you to spend time with it. Its lyrics are direct and its pleasures are simple-- as easy to notice as the mournful horns on \"Red Moon\", or hearing Leithauser hoping to get home to his loved one on the same song. While the Walkmen likely have more hits in them, if they keep making records as consistently engaging this, they wont sink for a lack of them. This is the sound theyve reached for since the very beginning, and theyve never played it as gracefully or confidently as they do here.",

        "article_text": "God bless middle school bullies: without the torment they’ve reliably inflicted on generation after generation of brooding, musically-inclined creative types, would there even be indie rock? At the very least there wouldn’t be “No Below”, one of the most striking songs on Northampton, Mass., noise-pop quartet Speedy Ortiz’s proper debut Major Arcana. “I didn’t know you when I broke my knee,” frontwoman Sadie Dupuis murmurs during the song’s wounded, palm-muted intro, “Spent the summer on crutches, and everybody teased.” Gnarled yet stingingly heartfelt, “No Below” blooms into a portrait of the artist as a friendless tween: death-obsessed, ditched by the one person at school who gets her, and left “freezing alone with [her] thoughts.” You know, the kind of early-onset trauma from which great, off-kilter bedroom-pop eventually springs.\nThe first album to bear Speedy Ortiz’s name (which itself is a nod to a doomed character in the beloved alt-comic Love and Rockets) was a solo affair. Dupuis’ self-recorded 2011 release The Death of Speedy Ortiz was a patchy, sardonic (sample titles: “Hexxy Sadie”, “Kinda Blew”) lo-fi gem in the tradition of early Sebadoh or Liz Phair’s legendary Girlysound tapes. But like the heroine of “No Below” (who later finds a companion to compare scars with: “Everything fucked up we both felt before/ I’m glad for it all if it got us where we are”), Dupuis eventually found strength in numbers. By the time Speedy Ortiz’s promising Sports EP came out last year, she’d brought in some new recruits-- bassist Darl Ferm, guitarist Matt Robidoux, and drummer Mike Falcone-- to kick the firepower up a notch. It worked wonders: A Speedy Ortiz song used to sound like a personally gummed, exactingly aimed spitball, but the best ones on the explosive, earthquaking Major Arcana land like grenades.\nStill, even as their songs have grown louder, gnarlier, and more compositionally ambitious, Speedy Ortiz have managed to preserve the intimacy and idiosyncrasy that made Dupuis’ early home recordings so compelling. Which is a testament not just to producer Justin Pizzoferrato (Dinosaur Jr., Chelsea Light Moving) but also to how receptively and thoughtfully all four members play off each other: Ferm and Falcone keep Major Arcana’s rhythms feeling fluid and adventurous but never sloppy, while the ongoing conversation between Dupuis’s vocals and Robidoux’s trebly, agile riffs is particularly essential to Speedy’s charm. As it does on “No Below”’s caustic, catchy chorus (“And though I once said/ I was better off just being dead”), Robidoux’s guitar usually mirrors or embroiders Dupuis’ vocal melody, underscoring her words rather than drowning them out.\nAnd thank goodness-- because Major Arcana finds Speedy Ortiz joining a depressingly small club of young indie rock bands (maybe the first new members since Parquet Courts’ Light Up Gold) writing lyrics that are actually worth poring over. “My mouth is a factory for every toxic part of speech I spew,” Dupuis quivers on the Mascis-indebted sludgefest “Tiger Tank”, and the rest of the record makes good on that promise. Like her hero Stephen Malkmus (she was once the frontwoman of an all-female Pavement cover band called-- wait for it-- Babement) Dupuis sings like someone palpably fascinated with the way words sound. Check, for one example, the way she scales the line, “criminally twisted puny little villain” in the opening moments of “Fun”, delighting in the texture of every vowel. Her lines strike a tricky balance between feeling loose and meticulously crafted-- another trick she must have learned from memorizing Malkmus quotables. On highlights like “Pioneer Spine” or the hellraising “Cash Cab”, Dupuis has a knack for turning seemingly dribbled-out mouthfuls into catchy hooks; in a lot of cases you won’t stop to marvel at the ingenuity of her lines until you’re already singing along.\nSpeedy Ortiz wear their love of the 1990s on their torn, flannel sleeves, which makes this particular round of Spot the Influence about as challenging as a game of teeball: there’s the squalling, guitar-on-guitar carnage of Archers of Loaf, the grungy mysticism of Helium (Dupuis lifted the title Major Arcana from a book she was reading on black magic), and of course the deadpan wit of vintage Phair (“I was never the witch that you made me to be,” Dupuis tells a burnt-out old flame on “Plough”, “Still you picked a virgin over me”). But don’t let any of that lead you to think that Speedy Ortiz are your garden variety nostalgists. Even at its most distortion-caked, there’s a melodic confidence and a gimlet-eyed clarity about Major Arcana that’s a rare find in a debut. They’ve got reverence for their forebears, sure, but unlike a lot of recent bands exhuming the ghosts of indie rock past, Speedy Ortiz also have faith in the peculiar personality traits that set them apart from their heroes. With its quaking rhythms, twisted riffage, and jet-black wit, Major Arcana is a redemptive ode to the broken bones that grew back together a little crooked-- the ones that taught Dupuis how to walk in her own weird way.",

        "article_text": "If Jeff Mangum had never been born, Colin Meloy could have assumed Jeff Mangums current status as indie rocks consummate pop songwriter freak. Which, of course, would mean some other wild-eyed kid from Montana would have had to be Colin Meloy. The Real Meloy, in this Trading Places-themed Twilight Zone, would have filled in for Mangums nasal warble and given the world the sweet gift of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea with his band Neutral Milk Hotel, while New Guy would front a band named, say, The Decemberists, who would shamelessly mine the sparkly folk-fuzz (sans-fuzz) of that most lauded of Elephant 6 bands. The Decemberists would be a tad poppier, and maybe a tad sweeter than their key influence, but fronted by a voice so close to Mangums that few could tell the difference. Some say this may even have actually happened. Some say its happening right now.\nSuch a mix-up is understandable (even if it may seem quite the opposite on paper): The Decemberists stick to the same kind of heavy acoustic folk-rock and freakish lyrical balladry that fueled Neutral Milk Hotels rise to power. Fortunately, their music also possesses enough unique twists to distinguish it from simple mimicry. The most obvious is the bands often baroque instrumentation, which generally makes for more elaborate arrangements than those of their stylistic forbearer. Hammond organ and subtle theremin flesh out the mix, each adding an anachronistic spin on the otherwise quaint jangle of strings and guitars hearkening to some dusty, distant past. Melodic organ riffs, meanwhile, slightly warp the old-time illusion of the music-- the better to compliment the absurd, rag-tag world at the center of this bands dreamy fictionalizations.\nThe Decemberists is a land of ghosts and petticoats, \"crooked French-Canadians\" gut-shot while running gin, bedwetters and gentlemen suitors, abandoned wastrels and pickpockets. Its also a realm of bizarre historical dreamscapes and snazzy wordplay: \"And just to lie with you/ Theres nothing that I wouldnt do/ Save lay my rifle down,\" sings Meloy in the bittersweet hallucination \"Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect\". Time and again, these unhappy tales and fantastic allegories ring out over strangely soothing, rolling folk that seldom breaks from a dense, melancholy haze.\nOnly once does Castaways and Cutouts fully escape the hypnotic pull of its darkling bedtime stories; \"July, July!\" may be the albums only genuinely happy moment, decked out in lush harmonies and fly-away choruses that clip their wings just shy of soaring towards anything too grand. And the band actually makes this singular elated moment stick by remaining reasonably understated-- despite the temptation there must have been to launch into a full-on celebration in the midst of such omnipresent malaise, the song is content to simply smile, permeating the surrounding bleakness with a subtle aura of peaceful contentment.\nThe constant sobriety of the rest of these tracks does wear thin now and then-- the inclusion of another similarly uplifting tune might have made the record somewhat more effective-- but the somber fables of Castaways and Cutouts remain compelling nonetheless. The Decemberists rarely put forth individually gripping songs, yet somehow, the result is a remarkable whole, an autonomous unit. From the opening cry of, \"My name is Leslie Anne Levine/ My mother birthed me down a dry ravine,\" to the albums exhausting conclusion, the fever never breaks. So, if Jeff Mangum really is on permanent vacation, were going to need a successor. Few bands seem as worthy of inheriting his twisted empire as The Decemberists.",

        "article_text": "To a certain extent, most of us are still living sheltered lives, insofar as we rarely confront our spirituality, reject our families, or cross our internal lines of social decency. Beliefs and codes vary from person to person like wardrobes, but very few people are willful, foolish or terminally self-aware enough to defy their own. Cultural expectations-- \"absurd and malignant\" or otherwise-- have sway, and the precious, indecent few who manage to outrun them are usually viewed as outcasts or criminals (though sometimes as prophets). Aside from whatever laws they break, criminals rob us of our conventions: Through acts of violence and upheaval, they force us to confront our boundaries. For some, ignoring the tenuous line between right and wrong is an easy feat, but for others, personal demons are as controlling as any backlog of cultural norms. From the sound of Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home, Angels of Light frontman Michael Gira may yet have demons to master and boundaries to set.\nGira broached straightforward indecency long ago, via his most infamous and acclaimed project, Swans. In the mid-80s, when even the most ruthlessly earnest punks were only beginning to come to terms with a \"responsible\" definition of anarchy, Gira and then-partner Jarboe were speaking, sometimes literally, of masochistic torture and humiliating, brutal sex, over drastically compressed drones and industrial propulsion. When the decade closed in an alternative rock flourish, Swans thrust forward by leaps and bounds: Love of Life, The Great Annihilator and especially Soundtracks for the Blind predicted Godspeed You Black Emperor! and all manner of dark-ambient music, though thematically, Swans still seemed to equate God with a dominatrix. Giras post-Swans (read: post-Jarboe) folk collective, The Angels of Light, matches his previous bands penchant for mythic grandeur with more muted dynamics, if not sentiment. Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home is their third release, and it is both disturbing and wonderful.\nAccording to Gira, the album is a response to various personal, historical and political disasters. In some ways, that cryptic declaration takes the edge off the songs, as without pretense theres vast room for interpretation in his lyrics. Where \"Palisades\" might read as a particularly bitter response to suicide (\"Reasons wont come/ And no one will regret that youre gone\"), it could as easily lament claustrophobic personal terror: \"Do you see how they ruined your mind?/ Do you see how they ruined your life?\" Giras smoke-stained baritone barely carries the words over acoustic guitar and delicate bell-tones, though later, he verges on overtaking a serene arrangement of church bells and a childrens choir. The altogether peaceful \"Kosinsky\", with its deft, gently strummed electric guitar and bright fiddle motif, initially reads as a tender love song; Giras description of hair like \"translucent, liquid light\" and \"the rhythm of your breathing\" seem poignant, though he again blurs boundaries by admitting he looks on his love with \"the eyes of an animal.\"\nThe textural range of Everything Is Good Here lends an epic, almost timeless quality that goes a long way toward fleshing out Giras often-mythological way with words. \"All Souls Rising\" features impressions of pagan ritual, and self-purification via \"the cull of foreign bone\" and forcing \"the blue smoke in... [to] fill the sac of skin.\" The relentless hammer of drums and murky stew of bass, organ and guitar-- not to mention Giras own droning war cries-- conjure scenes of violent sacrifice and the chaotic laws of a still-dominant Earth.\nContrarily, the midtempo, Beatlesque \"Sunset Park\" reveals little in its single repeated line, \"She brings some/ Shell bring one,\" but betrays a brilliant optimism in Giras simple, dignified melody and wall of shimmering guitars. Later, on \"Wedding\", an extended, gently strummed introduction is offset by ominous brass tones and the dissonant childrens choir, giving way to Giras rugged moan. The choir caps each phrase with angelic harmonies, quite removed from the intentionally grotesque sound of Swans, or even scattered moments on this album. As a whole, Everything Is Good Here is at once breathtaking and, like many Gira releases, simply too much.\nThe overwhelming impression is one of acceptance and redemption, despite repeatedly bleak (or at best, mysterious) narration from Gira. The production helps, but digging deeper into its lyrics, it seems that, rather than prolong an inner struggle, The Angels of Light seek salvation. \"What Will Come\" openly requests that God \"save us... from what will come,\" though its difficult to reconcile Giras leap of faith after an albums worth of explicitly self-empowering, judgmental narrative, clouded by contradiction. Nevertheless, music that resonates with as much emotional weight and vital abandon is rare, and though Im less inclined to look for answers in the mix than revel in its chaos, Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home is a commendable, heady experience.",

        "article_text": "Often when we say a record has \"atmosphere,\" we mean it as a put-down. From Sgt. Peppers to the present, a records sonic appeal-- the effects, the mood, the spaces between the notes-- is inextricable from how it hits us. But when an artist pushes atmosphere in place of songs, its frequently thought of as a crutch. Most listeners dont trust a mood to grab their hearts the way they trust, say, a human voice; nobody counts on production to deliver the \"money note.\"\nWhen I try to explain TV on the Radio to people who arent into them, the first thing on the checklist is singer Tunde Adebimpe, a stoic romantic who falters but never whimpers. Hes got about the best set of pipes in indie rock, yet on Return to Cookie Mountain his greatest strength lies in how well he stands back and blends in-- with the throatier Kyp Malone, guest singers including David Bowie, and, especially, with the atmosphere evoked by producer and noisemaker David Sitek. As the two founding members, Adebimpe and Sitek fit together like Jagger and Richards. But where the two Rolling Stones projected snarling sex, these guys express... what?\nIn the original version of Return to Cookie Mountain that leaked this spring-- the one that kicked off at full throttle with \"Wolf Like Me\"-- they sounded like victory. With that cut up front, you knew this was the great leap forward for which their last two records paved the way-- and when I say three records, Im counting their scattershot sketchbook OK Calculator, which caught the band at its most \"Hey, what can I do with this four-track?\" They always claim theyd rather keep messing around with new ideas than settle down and crank out the hits that are at their fingertips, which is one reason 2004s Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes felt more eclectic than excellent. (In retrospect, the other reason is that they were still using drum machines.) But this time, maybe theyd changed their minds.\nBut before Return to Cookie Mountain became their major label debut, its tracklist was reshuffled. Now it leads off with the fascinating \"I Was a Lover\", a sympathy card that carries the most emotional sample on the record-- a bellow like the sound of a sad elephant, which fits right in with the defeated verse. It takes skill to craft a tone that people can feel sorry for; maybe there is a money note locked in that pedal crouching under Siteks shoe. But other times, the noise evokes an orchestra, or a rockslide. Abstract and electronic textures roll over acoustic sources-- bowed upright bass, sitars, flutes, backward wind chimes-- to reach a perfect consistency, all the way through to the closer, \"Wash the Day Away\", where white noise rises and swallows them all. But not a moment too soon: not only is the mix stellar (if a little too biased away from the vocals), but once you get used to the new setlist, the pacing is perfect as well.\nThe band cycles up like a centrifuge. Vocals spin on \"Dirty Whirl\" like wooden figurines on a Swiss cuckoo clock, while a shimmering piano figure chimes across \"Province\". Like their first albums, the songs build on loops, grooves, and drones. They feel familiar, but theyve never sounded this good-- or this thick. Even the voices cascade on top of each other, which obscures much of the lyrics. Nothing can cut through except the sharp and vigorous rhythm section. Check out the way the air catches in Adebimpes throat on \"A Method\", then shakes loose when Jaleel Bunton bursts in like a drum corps waiting in the parking lot for the parade to start.\nBut whats their message? Theyre not here to rock-- they use too many loops, too much repetition, and too little chaos. They can do the community-drum-circle thing, but theyre too slick to try it more than once (\"Let the Devil In\"). And even Adebimpes voice has never sunk this far into the music; we dont even get an a capella feature this time, because this isnt an album about standing out. Hes still a failed romantic, a social conscience, a charmer, and a distant voyeur; but with every album he becomes less of a \"persona\" and more of a regular person.\nMaybe thats why this album has such an incredible pull: It doesnt make an atmosphere so much as a space to spend time in, and Adebimpe doesnt become a narrator so much as a witness. We sidle up into his head and watch through his eyes the tyrants, the druggies, the cocky lovers, the losers, and those beautiful fools who still surrender to lines like \"Love is the province of the brave.\" And TV on the Radio are standing in the center, watching it all go by again, and again, and again.",

        "article_text": "In a year when Brooklyn buzz travels around the world at lightspeed, you can probably count on one hand the number of new bands that, when the hype settles, are more than inconsequential collections of postures and exhausted second-hand styles. Vivian Girls, an all-female trio whove become overnight sensations among critics and underground rock fans, are seemingly candidates for one of those emperors new clothes-type reveals-- after all, they hail from said borough and perform lo-fi garage rock that taps a number of fashionable historical, ideological, and aesthetic wellsprings (C86! Slumberland! Olympia! Nuggets! Spector!). They deflect the knee-jerk criticism the most effective way possible, though: with an armful of kick-ass songs.\nVivian Girls 22-minute debut for the California-based garage-rock imprint In the Red is actually a reissue of this springs 500-copy run on the tiny Mauled by Tigers label. The original release sold out in 10 days, amping both the bands mystique and the records exchange value: A vinyl copy ended bidding at $68 on eBay a couple weeks ago. So far, Vivian Girls seem to be taking their subcultural celebrity-- not to mention the summer departure of drummer and band founder Frankie Rose for brother band Crystal Stilts-- in stride. In the intentionally dorky video for \"Tell the World\", Cassie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali Koehler address the camera, poised and unsmiling, even as they pantomime the usual humiliating music vid motions. \nThe bands lyrics are just as purposefully passive. In his intro to Rhinos superlative box set, One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Group Sounds Lost and Found, critic Gene Sculatti locates the enduring popularity of 60s girl group music in its effect: \"This music was, like a moving symphony or free-floating jazz jam, mainly about a feel, a sound. It had words, yes, but they were never intended to get in the way of the overall impact of the record.\" Punk credentials aside, Vivian Girls are clearly simpatico to that gentler eras agenda. According to the band, the album is somewhat conceptual, its 10 tracks evenly split between love and heartbreak. \"No\", an angry thrash-and-bash propelled by a single lyric (guess!) is easy to place. But the LP is rarely so transparent, and Vivian Girls mainly get their message across with a murky wall of noise. Try to pry the lyrics of cacophonous openers \"All the Time\" and “Such a Joke\" from their shoegazery feedback, thudding bass, and tambourine rattle and youll be missing the point.\nWithout risking pastiche, the band gets plenty of mileage from its sonic references. \"Tell the World\"s frantic beat recalls the jittery, chaotic rhythm of Black Tambourines \"Throw Aggi Off the Bridge\", while the Girls flawless, calmly executed three-part harmony counters with the satin-shoed professionalism of the Crystals. The lyrics-- this is one of Vivian Girls few completely legible songs-- are as ambivalent: \"Ill tell the world about the love that Ive found,\" they enthuse, giving public voice to teenage infatuation (an evergreen girl-group subject), while at the same time raising the Spector of out-of-whack control issues: \"He sees what I see/ He feels what I feel.\" (Not convinced? Switch out the gender of the pronoun and singers.) The end result is phenomenal, one of 2008s best songs. The sweet jangled \"Where Do You Run To\" is almost as great, making pining at home seem not so bad, all things considered.The trio nabbed its name from the heroines of outsider artist Henry Dargers magnum opus, In the Realms of the Unreal. A sorority of vaguely fetishized hermaphrodite messiahs, Dargers Vivian girls are some of the most slippery, troublesome figures in contemporary art, making the bands appropriation a clever bit of self-mythologizing. The final track on their album, \"I Believe in Nothing\", purportedly endorses nihilism. But it puts the lie to its own message with heavenly madrigals and a hooky refrain thatll burrow into your brain and replay like a mantra until you do, in fact, believe in something. Even if its just this really awesome new band.",

        "article_text": "There’s a continual tension in experimental electronic music between developing and owning a particular sound and exploring new ones. Creating a unique identity is difficult, and sometimes breaking out of it once its been established is even harder. Daniel Lopatin of Oneohtrix Point Never is an artist working at one end of this spectrum. He’s restless, searching for new terrain, and his more recent full-lengths have found him reinventing himself with each new record. R Plus Seven, the follow-up to 2011’s Replica, sounds little like previous OPN releases. But despite the radical shifts—and this is what makes this project so consistently rewarding—you can still hear him in it; there are bedrock approaches and clear musical values that you can pick out as Lopatin. \nThe general approach on R Plus Seven is to build new music using the bright yet cold textures of the early age of personal computing. The aesthetic is identifiably “80s,” but it’s not the 80s of new wave, with its familiar array of synthesizers. Instead, Lopatin focuses on the hauntingly clean and clear pre-set sounds that were available for early, crude digital music production (and which were often used in commercial applications, from bumpers for local PBS shows to soundtracking instructional videos) and adds the kind of short-burst bits of information that were common when a sampler could hold two or three seconds of 8-bit audio. While this sort of throwback is common in electronic music, for Lopatin it serves a purpose beyond reference. R Plus Seven is aware of how music and textures like this are likely to be received, but it plays with our collective unconscious of music technology to develop something that comes off as strange and otherworldly and, most importantly, rich with feeling, despite the icy surface layer. \nThere’s a weird kind of innocence in this sound palette. The fake horns and whooshing vocal samples evoke a time when “the computer” as a concept was still very much rooted in the future rather than the present. The chintzy approximations of common instruments contain a sort of implicit critique of the idea that technology will save us all, but Lopatin’s music doesn’t get hung up on irony, even though its definitely in the mix. It’s this quality, of highlighting the vacuous side of this music while simultaneously embracing its humor and poignancy, that elevates the OPN project to another plane. \nAlong those lines, during my first few listens to R Plus Seven, it was hard not to think of James Ferraro’s recent work in this area, specifically his album Far Side Virtual, which used the impossibly cheerful and polished sound of early digital culture to emphasize the music’s connection to mindless, friction-free commerce. To Ferraro’s credit, he’s kept a poker face when presenting this music, and you never quite knew where he was coming from, which made the listening experience fraught with ambiguity and anxiety. But Lopatin comes at it from another angle. He wants his music to do things that music is traditionally known to do: change, develop, use melody to convey feelings, build tension and then release it. That all of this happens within such tightly controlled parameters makes the fact that the record is emotionally engaging that much more impressive. Common sonic threads include wispy digitized voices on tracks like “Americans” and “Chrome Country” that bring to mind the then-exotic turn-of-the-80s sound of the Fairlight synthesizer, an early sampling device, along with many brittle digital versions of sounds that are distantly “exotic,” conveying the feel of a blocky pixilated representation of a jungle or beach scenes.  \nIndeed, with “Americans” and “Inside World”, the album makes sharp use of contrasts between the real and the virtual, between “natural” and the representation of natural. I’m tempted to call it Fifth World Music in homage to the 1980 John Hassel/Brian Eno album Fourth World: Possible Musics, a record that has a clear spiritual connection to this one. Hassel and Eno hoped to filter ancient tribal sounds through the sound of technology to create an alien but distantly familiar landscape (their project generated discussion about clumsy wording and potentially problematic ideas of what constituted “primitive” music, but that’s a subject for another time). Lopatin grapples with some of those ideas of decontextualization and colliding worlds, but the meeting place is closer to a tableau from Second Life, providing another layer of disorientation. \nStill, I can’t underscore strongly enough that, as with Replica, all of this takes place in a realm where musicality is paramount. You don’t listen to this record thinking about theory; it’s beautiful stuff, with chords and tunes and sections you remember. And it also draws from more sounds and eras than I’ve given it credit for. Opening track “Boring Angel” seems a tribute to the glorious repetition of Terry Riley’s process music, while “Along” and “Cryo” are closer to the mood and structure of that place where late-90s IDM sounds met the winding structures of post-rock. R Plus Seven doesn’t have quite the disembodied weirdness of Replica, but it’s no less accomplished, another intriguing chapter from an artist whose work remains alive with possibility. ",

        "article_text": "In underground metal years, Boris are senior citizens: Their self-released debut full-length, Absolutego, dates back to 1996, and compilations were hosting their material two years prior to that. But as invigorating as some of their earlier records are, the band didnt begin to gain a substantial following outside the metal world until 2003s outstanding Akuma No Uta-- parodying the artwork of Nick Drakes Bryter Layter-- struck a chord with independent music fans seeking an antidote to the more polite pop sounds of the Shins, Sufjan, and Death Cab for Cutie. Now, following more than a decade of hard labor and a swarm of 2005 releases, the trio gives their ever-expanding audience something to chew on: Pink is their best album yet, and by some distance the most accessible of their career to date.\nThe past 12 months have been increasingly kind to louder and more challenging artists, but even if Sunn0))) hadnt droned onto discerning hipsters iPods, its not difficult to imagine the awesomeness of Pink-- a supremely well-paced rocknroll album thats quickly winning over even long-suffering metalphobes-- helping these Japanese veterans leap-frog indie kids into a New York Times Arts \u0026 Leisure mention. If you dont believe me, sneak a listen to the spaced-out seven-minute opener, which manages to combine the best elements of classic British shoegaze and Sigur Rós with bliss-out metal faves Jesu and Isis. Just dont bank on the rest of the album to follow in its footsteps. After all, the three folks behind it-- guitarist Wata, bassist/vocalist Takeshi, and drumming vocalist Atsuo-- are the same atom-smashers who nicked their named from a Melvins song, operate the Walmart-friendly Fangs Anal Satan record label, and downshift from blown-out Motörhead to Earth on a dime. Theyve collaborated thrice with Merzbow, worshipped amplifiers with multitasking experimental rock legend Keiji Haino, and chilled with noise legend Masonna. Put simply, theyre too restless (and ambitious) to fixate on a single style.\nSo, after allowing the opener to evaporate, Boris jump-cut to the albums title cut-- a full-throttle psych riot. Track threes high-octane guitars circle Atsuos \"yeah\"s and \"ooh\"s until treating us to a magnificent feedbackndrum finale. Track four ups the fuel intake, sporting Pinks highest in-the-red ratio, while track five sweeps aside its predecessors with a pile of industrial Melvins sludge topped with sheering Blade Runner delay, six-string atmospherics, and angstful, wailed vocals. Then, as that brief respite passes, \"Electric\" cranks the cowbell for two minutes of instrumental boogie, replete with tiny post-punk guitar daggers closing out the song. And theres still more  distorted head space to follow, all of it well-stitched and feral. To keep it brief, key moments include: 1) the rising/falling near-pop vocals and final wall of fuzz on track seven; 2) stoner handclaps and Olivia Tremor Control studio effects on track eight; and 3) the textural shift of track nine, where bone-dry, gutteral drums and crashing junk-shard cymbals overtake the bass fuzz and vocals completely.\nEnter the finale. Ten seconds of silence introduces the gentle strum and softly brushed drums of the penultimate \"My Machine\". Its mood hearkens back to the opening song, briefly reprising its blissed-out tone, but two minutes later, reveals itself instead as a forward-looking antidotal preface to Pinks final 10-minute juggernaut and standout track. The closer delivers an absolutely massive wallop, overlapping entropic vocal lines with furious ambient spillage. I used to think that, of everyone in the punk realm, Unwound or Drive Like Jehu had the best control over their feedback flutters, but this things gonzo in its perfectly dense acrobatics. And best of all, its unshakably addictive refrain, blistering, scorched-out guitars, thunderous, supercharged rock, and countless change-ups not only warrant its extended length, but make it feel about half as long as it actually is, and keep the listener fully engaged throughout its entire runtime.\nAs their timeline suggests-- or, to be more accurate, as their history makes it impossible to guess-- Boris could follow Pink with an hour of fried electro-acoustic guitar, powerbook, and piano glitches. Or they could soundtrack a short film in braille. Then, of course, theres Altar, their much-anticipated upcoming collaboration with Sunn0))). But for now, basking in Pinks riptide, Wata, Takeshi, and Atsuo are 2006s balls-out riff-makers to beat. The bars been raised high and early, rockers-- dont bump your head when you try to sneak under it.\n ",

        "article_text": "Before writing the bulk of his legendary canon of plays and sonnets, William Shakespeare penned the charmingly flawed revenge tragedy Titus Andronicus. Due to its laughable bombast and over-the-top violence, its influence on contemporary culture has emerged mainly in dark comedies like Sweeney Todd or \"South Park\", and many Shakespeare scholars still balk at seriously analyzing the work. Of course, all these factors make the play a perfect moniker for an indie band as violent, overblown, and irreverent as Glen Rock, New Jerseys Titus Andronicus.\nDespite its titles implied politeness, The Airing of Grievances qualifies more as existentialism wrapped in an anti-suburban screed. Frontman Patrick Stickles howls with anguish way beyond his 22 years, often cramming lyrics into tight spaces just to make sure he gets the last word in. Plus, as anyone whos heard five seconds of this band already knows, he sounds like Conor Oberst screaming from the bowels of hell. However, to peg these guys as \"emo\" would be sadly inaccurate. Sure, torn diary page scribbles clutter Airings heart-on-sleeve, fist-in-air anthems, but the dramas more Boss than Bright Eyes, fueled by blue collar frustration and, most notably, beer.\nSo far Tituss rowdy live shows have generated the most buzz around the group; check your local listings, theyre probably playing in a friends tool shed near you. Those small venue acoustics translate wonderfully on the bands debut, its muffled mixing reminiscent of listening to a bar band from the mens room. Yet this inebriated aesthetic only intensifies the literary streak running through Stickles easily excitable veins. A brusque \"fuck you!\" cues the band on Pogues-like opener \"Fear \u0026 Loathing in Mahwah, NJ\", but once the rubble clears its a villainous quote from Titus Andronicuss Aaron the Moor that most elegantly expresses Stickles bile: \"I have done a thousand dreadful things/ ...And nothing grieves me heartily indeed/ But that I cannot do ten thousand more.\" As if the dreary title and playful, mock-optimistic guitar riffs of \"No Future Part II: The Day After No Future\" arent enough to wrench your soul, the song ends with the closing passage from Albert Camus The Stranger, in which the narrator wishes to be jeered by a large crowd on the day of his execution.\nOf course, none of these highfalutin shout-outs will grab your ear as powerfully as the demonic E Street Band arrangements, rife with constant builds and breakneck rhythms. Nearly every track here starts innocently, usually with a straightforward eighth-note strum or folksy melody unaware of the beating its about to go through. Whereas a band like Arcade Fire likes to gradually crescendo to enhance the dramatic oomph, Titus cant enjoy that luxury-- not when Stickles is already screaming by the second lyric. Fortunately the band finds unconventional ways to heighten its music, like \"Arms Against Atrophy\", which waits three-quarters of its duration to unveil a killer, song-altering guitar riff, or the outro on \"Upon Viewing Brughels Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\", when the band corrals a maelstrom of stop-start solos into a steady, almost rockabilly groove.\nThree-minute war cry \"Titus Andronicus\" best encapsulates Airings pathos, and serves as a fitting primer for an otherwise hefty and (initially) inscrutable album. Bemoaning the creativity-crushing effects of his environs (\"Ill write my masterpiece some other day\"), Stickles imagines a conformist nightmare of no sex, no booze, and no cigarettes, blurting \"fuck everything, fuck me\" in between two verses just for effect. As Airings most memorable moment, the songs taunting chorus maxim \"Your life is over!\" becomes to these guys what \"In the name of love!\" was for early U2. On a lyric sheet, Titus Andronicus may appear to espouse the sort of wrist-cutting histrionics emos typically lambasted for, but the magic lies in the bands oddly enthusiastic grass roots delivery. Theyve studied their philosophy and found that life actually is pointless, so why not go down swinging?",

        "article_text": "If youre lucky, you might already know this guy as Final Fantasy. His reasons for dropping that name are probably boring and copyright-related, but still: The name change seems healthy on whole other extra-legal levels. Ive never known anyone not to be wowed by Final Fantasys live show, and Final Fantasys live show is just Owen Pallett: the guy himself, a violin, and a loop pedal. Its about as solo as anything gets-- a performance, not a project. Stepping out under his own name feels like an acknowledgement of this, as if Palletts ready to cast aside the modesty of having a \"project\"-- its just this thing Ive been working on-- and present himself, fully upright, as an artist.\nAnd there are a lot of things about Heartland that feel like Pallett is presenting himself more and more fully as an artist; the scope of breadth and mood of it are all grander, more assured, making ever more of a case that the guy shouldnt be viewed as a side note (string arranger for the Arcade Fire, the Pet Shop Boys) or a minor interest (D\u0026D enthusiast, guy who titled an album He Poos Clouds). After all, one of this albums closest cousins in the indie world is a notable, well-regarded one: Joanna Newsoms Ys. Both are ambitious, classicist, cleverly arranged, lyrically high-concept, dense with possible meaning-- and, yes, a little strange.\nIts that density that separates them, though, and makes me regret having to review this record in any kind of timely fashion. Im still smarting over having underrated Palletts last full-length; I knew I loved it, but had no way of knowing it would stick with me for months, years. And this one is richer: Pallett has leaped beyond arranging for chambers and quartets, working now with electronics, with drums, with electric bass, with the Czech Philharmonic, with Nico Muhly. These are pop songs through and through-- lively, propulsive ones. But the wonder of them is in those arrangements, which are just ripe with motion and detail-- and theyre not decorative (as was sometimes the case with Ys), but central. The most immediate track here, \"Lewis Takes Action\", has Pallett singing grand, anthemic hooks, but the parts youre most likely to wind up humming are the stately brass and woodwind figures between them-- the amount of care and pleasure in these arrangements is extremely generous.\nIf youre wondering who \"Lewis\" is and what sort of action hes taking, well, this is one of the things thats just singular and fascinating about Pallett, every bit as much as his music-school voice or the charmingly mannered way he approaches his melodies. On He Poos Clouds, Pallett seemed to be singing about real people, even ordinary ones; it was just that they tended to describe their emotional states in the grand terms of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons magic and conjuring. Since then, Palletts jumped fully into fantasy: These twelve songs are monologues from Lewis, an \"ultra-violent farmer\" in a world called Spectrum, as he tries to come to grips with his own creator, Owen Pallett. Daunting as that might sound-- there may be hand-to-hand combat with a cockatrice involved-- all it really means is that these are songs about power and faith and control: songs that allow you to sing lines like, \"the night is split by the whistle of my amber whip,\" and have it be about feeling your own power, or just repeat, \"Im never gonna give it to you,\" and have it be about rejecting someone elses.\nYoull have to get back to me in a few months to see how it all unravels, but in the meantime these songs are steadily revealing ever more to love. Martial drums and strings rumbling tense in the foreground with clouds of strings overhead. The sly, soulful melody of \"Oh Heartland, Up Yours!\"-- something that feels new in Palletts repertoire. A kind of orchestral motorik beat on \"Tryst with Mephistopheles\". The way something like an 808 kick drum loops its way darkly into \"Red Sun No. 5\". Hints of Kurt Weill. This stuff is rich with ideas, and theyre offered in the kind of rich, warm sound that should be accessible to more fans than ever before. Those of you with the inclination to pick them up will find a lot to reward you.",

        "article_text": "Whatever or wherever Sisterworld is, it sounds like a pretty creepy place. The fifth Liars album is relentlessly tense-- not so much scary as surreal. Every track is shrouded in echo and anxiety, and often all the tension erupts into bursts of buzzing guitars or pounding beats. Not every dark cloud breaks into a thunderstorm, but it constantly feels like one is lurking around the corner.\nDespite such potential for surprise, overall Sisterworld isnt actually all that surprising compared to the rest of Liars discography. For a band known for switching gears from track to track and album to album, this is the most thoroughly Liars-sounding record so far. It has the rhythmic insistence of Drums Not Dead, the sleepwalking chants of They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, and the straightforward songwriting of Liars, often sounding like a streamlined update on the latter. The narrowed range brings increased depth, and its intriguing to hear Liars focus on detail and texture rather than stylistic schizophrenia. It turns out refinement suits them as nicely as reinvention.\nTake \"Here Comes All the People\", which the band spent a year on, crafting its basic structure in Los Angeles and adding orchestral atmospheres in Prague. None of that guarantees quality-- its possible to make crap in both L.A. and Prague. But Liars used this elongated process to give zoomed-in attention to each moment. So the trembling guitar line, high-pitched strings, and psychotic piano all fit together, like a puzzle whose picture isnt clear until the last piece is in place. When singer Angus Andrew ends the song by chanting \"counting victims one by one,\" the killer effect comes through lethal injection rather than a loud, blunt act. That mood continues into the meditative \"Drip\", a track thats almost all atmosphere, with Andrew murmuring, \"When will I awake from this dormant sleep?\" as if he has no say in the matter.\nNot everything on Sisterworld is so subdued. \"Proud Evolution\" grows into a persistent Krautrock-styled groove; the clicking \"No Barrier Fun\" has the catchy lilt of a nursery rhyme; and \"Scarecrows on a Killer Slant\" sounds like a warped version of Liars slamming \"Plaster Casts of Everything\". Even \"Drop Dead\", a drunken march that sound ever ready to collapse, holds upbeat energy in its skewed sway. Still, the dominant mode here is creeping tension without tons of cathartic release. That tension is so well-crafted that it consistently engages, but 42 minutes of it might not completely win over every Liars fan, especially those drawn to their more raucous moments. Admittedly, some parts are easier to admire than they are to enjoy. But stick with Sisterworld as it builds, let it seep into your brain while you wait for its bulging seams to burst, and you might find yourself unable to turn your ears away. Eventually, Liars commitment to their own creepy cause proves contagious.",

        "article_text": "There are a few things weve come to expect from recent, home-recorded indie pop: thin production, lyrics that reference childhood and nostalgia, a vibe of hushed intimacy, lots of reverb. Youth Lagoon, the project of 22-year-old Boise, Idaho, musician Trevor Powers, ticks all of those boxes and sounds immediately familiar the first time you put it on. \"Posters\", the opening track on his debut LP, The Year of Hibernation, even starts with a warbly synth to evoke the fabled VHS glow that has become a touchstone for kids of his generation. When you hear so much of this stuff, it starts to bleed together-- almost as if by design-- and you start to wonder what it would take for an artist in this realm to stand out. Powers has a few ideas.\nSome of the albums appeal is straightforward. Powers writes melodies you remember and has an excellent ear for arrangement, even if the songs are rendered crudely. They generally start as whispered laments and then twist and turn until they become huge \"oh oh oh\" sing-alongs. The album sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom, which feels right given the small and personal details of the songs, but it strains to break free of its technical limitations. Rare is the record in this sphere that works much better loud, but The Year of Hibernation wants to be cranked. Room-filling volume allows a song like \"Afternoon\" to grow from its delicate, whistle-and-electric-keyboard opening into its grand, swelling conclusion, with a 4/4 marching drum and wordless vocal refrain that envelopes you like a hug.\nThe title of the record describes its world. These are songs about alternately hunkering down and hiding, and heading out into the world to explore and report back on what youve found. Powers is very much an innocent here, a kid with an ear for poetry who mixes striking images with the occasional groaner. The music of the Pacific Northwest feels like a key touchstone, and in many ways Youth Lagoon seems like a shy, quiet, and more hermetic version of what Modest Mouse were doing before 1997s The Lonesome Crowded West. Small town claustrophobia bumps against the possibility of wide-open spaces. Two of the first three songs reference the late-night strobe of the television and beds and walls of posters, and these are mixed with campgrounds, woods, lakes, and watching fireworks from a roof. I dont want to strain the Modest Mouse comparison, since this record doesnt have a \"band\" feel, but the guitar breaks also show Isaac Brocks early flair for simple melodic embellishments that complement the songs perfectly.\nDean Wareham is another guitarist with an ear for elegant guitar leads, and the comparisons with Galaxie 500 extend to Powers cracked guitar whine and way of building clattering and echo-laden arrangements to moments of grandeur (not to mention the G500-like song \"July\" that outlines a disintegrating relationship against the backdrop of a sky filled with explosions.) Powers is small-town through-and-through and doesnt have a hint of Warehams cosmopolitan sophistication, but that works for this landscape. Hibernation is a record for pulling up the covers and dreaming and then venturing out to the town to see the strange and magical world of encroaching adulthood. The anthemic \"Cannons\" starts off with Powers singing, \"Rolling up the windows of my 96 Buick so the rain cant get inside of it,\" and that pretty much sums it up: The record mixes feelings of protection and safety with the tug of adventure and wraps it in compulsively listenable music that explodes at just the right moments.",

        "article_text": "More than 12 years after he emoted all over the first verse on the first track on the first Wu-Tang Clan album, the now 35-year-old Ghostface Killah is still starving for respect, understanding, and acceptance. Hypnotically restless, the East Coast purist has homed in on a rap palette full of vivid hurt and strafing alarm-- and bursting forth with some of the most potent yarns, barbs, and production of his remarkably consistent career, Fishscale is the choice outcome of a creative mind using experience as a compass en route to triumph.\nThough Ghostfaces veteran status informs much of his fifth solo album, his father-knows-best pose is led by breathless rhymes, not nostalgia. To wit, \"Whip You With a Strap\" rails against the lack of consequences brought upon todays youth with a smooth cleverness, while \"Big Girl\" moans about three fast-living women wasting their potential on cocaine mounds. Tellingly, its Ghosts own coke the girls cant stop sniffing. Such ambiguities eschew didacticism for a lived-in wisdom thats as wicked as it is worthwhile.\nGhosts godfather-cause is most noticeably directed at ostentatious modern-day rap hustlers who largely cook up tales with broad lines and no consequences, as he devotes several of Fishscales 18 songs to the booming drug-rap subgenre he helped launch in 1995 with Raekwons Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... On both \"R.A.G.U.\" and \"Kilo\", Rae turns up to assist his close friend, describing the perils of the drug trade. Hardly akin to the dealer-as-infallible-ghetto-champion guise currently purported by the likes of Young Jeezy, Fishscales dope peddlers are harried and frayed. Between broken wrists, familial strife, and self-inflicted gunshots to the groin, \"R.A.G.U.\" is anything but glorifying toward its stressed-out, drug-running protagonists.\nBut the albums most vivid illicit spectacle belongs to Ghost alone; \"Shakey Dog\" takes the rappers penchant for eye-popping lyrical imagery to its extreme, offering a twisty Mamet-style narrative about a botched two-man robbery attempt. \"Fasten your seatbelts,\" warns the Staten Island son before unraveling a scene so perfectly lucid that an accompanying video would be redundant. Whether describing the alluring smells coming from his victims apartment or the ruthless history of an ancillary old lady (\"She paid her dues when she smoked her brother-in-law at her boss wedding\") he passes on his way up to the place, Ghost touches on myriad senses and memories-- its the kind of song that requires several close listens to understand at all. It also strongly suggests that, if Ghost ever loses his appetite for rap, he might find success as a screenwriter.\nAs the albums other specific tragedies-- shitty haircuts, bus stop infatuation gone awry-- fly by with deft everyman flourishes, its the surreal \"Underwater\", with its strange spirituality, that proves most trenchant. The dreamy account finds our hero playing out a possible afterlife allegory while swimming at the bottom of the ocean. \"Im not on my turf,\" he confesses as mermaids \"with Halle Berry haircuts\" offer guidance along the way. In the tourist role, Ghost is as compelling as when hes recounting pavement-bred stories of his familiar youth. Sometimes on \"Underwater\", the two come together brilliantly like when he notices \"SpongeBob in a Bentely coup, bangin the Isleys.\" Eventually arriving at the \"worlds banginest mosque,\" Ghost finds comfort in Muslim chants; the rappers rare moment of peace is well-deserved amidst Fishscales enthralling agony. Aiding in the tracks calming vibes is a mysterious, flute-laden beat courtesy of MF Doom, whos responsible for four beats on the record. The masked supervillain is in the company of a reputable bevy of soul-stacked sample-masters on Fishscale and their musical backdrops match Ghosts focus and vision.\nIn an interview with RZA last year, he told me, \"Listen to how Ghost sounds rappin over one of my beats and then over another beat... he sounds like a grown man [on my beat] and he sound younger on [other] producers beats because they dont know the frequency.\" But, as the first solo Ghost disc without a RZA production, Fishscale attests he was wrong. Whether its the late Dilla providing his off-kilter vinyl-hiss haze for \"Strap\", Pete Rock cutting up Sly Stones \"Family Affair\" on the hollow funk of posse cut \"Dogs of War\", or Just Blaze doing his Banger 101 thing on \"The Champ\" (which, stripped of its bootleg Rocky samples at the last minute thanks to copyright issues, still packs heat), each producer takes his opportunity to envelop todays most soulful rapper with deep swaths of vintage samples and deep drums. The RZAs sonic influence remains strong-- and he even shows up briefly on the excellent Wu reunion cut \"9 Milli Bros\"-- but his absence behind the Fishscale boards is largely inconsequential.\nConsidering Ghosts continued status as one of hip-hops most revered, relevant elder statesmen, it seems odd that his name was seldom bandied about in most of the last decades King of New York debates. Fishscale reiterates with cinematic verve that the most vital current Wu Tang Clan members storytelling can match Biggies in both excitement and humor. Yet Ghosts songs are unrelenting in their slavishness to density and credibility, and that can turn off casual listeners even as it intoxicates hip-hop purists. \"My arts is crafty darts, why yall stuck with Laffy Taffy?\" he asks with utter sincerity on \"The Champ\". As long as inevitable questions like that continually re-up this heavyweights unswerving drive, theyre probably better left unanswered.\n ",

        "article_text": "Brooklyns indie scene can feel like a series of bands each trying to be hipper than the next, but thankfully nobody told Pete Silberman. In the dog days of 2009s deadbeat summer, the Antlers frontman emerged from his bedroom with his third LP, Hospice. On it, he unfashionably embraced hackles-raising choruses and concept-album ambition, and he pushed the button on emotional nuclear options: abortion, cancer, death, all that fun stuff. Now a trio, the Antlers have claimed the influence of \"electronic music\" for Burst Apart, a typical omen for a typically \"difficult follow-up album.\" But while Burst Apart sheds the PR-bait bio and Arcade Fire aspirations that made its predecessor a word-of-mouth success, its still tethered to a magnanimity and expressive clarity that makes it almost every bit as devastating.\nLead single \"Parentheses\" didnt do much to show their hand; its pretty misleading out of context. Sounding like a higher-BPM \"Climbing Up the Walls\", the knockabout electronic percussion and tweaked piano ripples rightfully marked some connection to the post-OK Computer, pre-Kid A application of Mo Wax and Warp textures to alt-rock song structures. But the aggression in Silbermans falsetto and the gnarly guitar distortion are revealed as total outliers, and Burst Apart can actually be seen as Hospice turned inside out: Where before, long swathes of calm white noise linked emotive outcries, Burst Apart moves patiently through luxurious downtempo tones belying some serious romantic disturbance.\nThose well-versed in dream journal interpretation could gather that from the mere title of \"Every Night My Teeth Are Falling Out\" (a common symbolic manifestation of sexual frustration). After all, Burst Apart does open with \"I Dont Want Love\", a heartbreaking wallow in a numbing hangover from a singer who previously seemed doomed to feel too much. Its glistening melody at least helps it scan as pop, but \"Parentheses\" and \"Every Night\" feel cut from the same cloth as the Walkmens \"The Rat\", holding onto sanity with white knuckles, sexual congress seen as mutually assured destruction.\nAside from those, Burst Aparts atmosphere is nocturnal and desolate. Foreboding death-crawl \"No Widows\" fears for vehicular disaster; brief flickers of light are allowed full exposure on the gorgeous, incantatory centerpiece \"Rolled Together\", whose brushed drum work and silvery guitars could be heard as a studiously completed homework assignment on Agaetis Byrjun. Meanwhile, the tender, nearly beatless balladry of \"Hounds\" and \"Corsicana\" are wholly the Antlers own and painfully pretty to behold-- however depressive Silbermans lyrics, one can simply revel in the zero-gravity synth and vocal moans and feel some sort of uplift.\nShame that it makes Burst Aparts missteps all too egregious. This isnt the sort of record that calls for a show-stopping power ballad, but we get one anyway with \"Putting the Dog to Sleep\", where needlessly histrionic vocals and an overwrought doo-wop progression come off more like last call karaoke than a fitting closer. If nothing else, \"Putting the Dog to Sleep\" helps point toward the Antlers successfully making Burst Apart more about their growth as a band than a gripping backstory-- for all of Hospices raw power, it didnt leave much to the imagination, and it either hit you right in the gut or not at all. The Antlers wont hold your hand through Burst Apart, which will inevitably make it more of a grower, but stick around-- its all the more affecting for how it allows you to pick your own stumbling, lonely path.",

        "article_text": "Hip-hops earliest records often relied on faded, scratchy source material run through entry-level equipment. Even as technology advanced, the grain and the gristle stuck around-- sometimes out of necessity, sometimes as an extra ingredient. Over time, those aged, decaying sounds burrowed their way underground to crop up in pockets of IDM, dubstep, and indie hip-hop, resulting in music, built around texture more than bass or treble, that often sounded ragged at birth.\nWith his second album, Flying Lotus (aka Steven Ellison) has mastered this texture. Los Angeles is filled with the crackle of static, but theres something about this ambient noise-- a nuisance to audiophiles, a sign of weakness in radio signals-- that feels oddly comforting. Rather than audio damage or interference, this deceptively entrancing record (stick with it, its a grower) feels like nature; its almost as though Ellison went out of his way to digitize and filter the sound of rain hitting a sidewalk to accompany its beats. Opener \"Brainfeeder\" bristles with sharp rattling taps, while \"Breathe. Something/Stellar STar\" transmutes it into boiling-water burble, and even the 1960s sci-fi foley-room chatter on the 43-second \"Orbit 405\" is underpinned by snarling, distorted, pre-amp buzz. It sounds less like an album built on damaged, beat-up, pre-existing vinyl loops than a clean, shiny new LP put through four decades worth of wear and mishandling.\nThe static, of course, is just a single (if crucial) ingredient in the character of Los Angeles: What this album relies on specifically is the way that crackle and buzz reacts to the rhythm at the core. Flying Lotus shares passing similarities to the late J Dilla and fellow Cali beat creator Madlib in the way he puts together his beats, and its not hard to hear touches of James Yanceys Ummah-era production tricks infused with the same off-kilter slipperiness you might find on a recent Beat Konducta release. And in Ellisons hands, these tricks are stridently odd where they could have been safely derivative, revealing a deep affinity for psychedelic lushness and digital distortion that puts him in his own class.\nLos Angeles is also prone to letting its beats hang loosely in the air. Ellison often slips empty space inside the rhythm (another place where the ambient static comes in handy), and even when the tempo accelerates past the albums typical leisurely pace and finds itself driving a track packed with wall-to-wall bass, little of it seems hectic or jarring-- even the jittery tweaker-electro of \"Parisian Goldfish\" smoothes out into a pleasant pulse once it sets in. At its most stirring moments, the music can be soothingly meditative, though the booming low-end, sharp drums, and all that crackle and fuzz keep it from sounding too polite. With its accomplished fusion of debris and warmth in a place somewhere between b-boy head-nod and laptopper experimentalism, Los Angeles is a big step forward for a still-young career, an album well worth revisiting years from now-- preferably on vinyl, where the pops and clicks can only multiply.",

        "article_text": "Dear Science, TV on the Radios follow-up to 2006s Return to Cookie Mountain-- a dense and textural album with an optimistic core-- is catchier, but thornier than its predecessor. Musically, its an instant grabber: Handclaps crack like fireworks. TVOTRs horns, courtesy of the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, sound punchier and brighter than ever before. Vocalists Tunde Adebimpe and guitarist/singer Kyp Malone thrive as dual frontmen: Theyre sexy when theyre angry, and even sexier when theyre not. And David Siteks production is shiny and urgent, while his harsher synths and doo-dads hang back like a commentary track.\nBut making popular music sits uneasily with this art-rock crew, and so although this is TV on the Radios slickest, catchiest, and potentially most popular LP, it nevertheless reeks with dread. Lyrics about the dead, death, and dying litter the album from its second line onward. Songs with sentimental titles carry the most dire lyrics-- like \"Family Tree\", a gorgeous ballad about forbidden love whose titular plant becomes a gallows. And the lyrics to \"Red Dress\" are almost childishly pouty. Assuming the role of industry-bred stars, TVOTR complain that instead of waving collective fists in the air, listeners are merely getting down to their Prince-like guitars and brash brass: \"They got you tamed, and they got me tamed.\" But the self-hatred makes it engaging: \"Im living a life not worth dying for.\" \nThe promise of dancing away all your troubles hangs over every sweaty note, until TVOTR happily yank it away. On \"Dancing Choose\", the big chorus and synth power-chords interrupt the funk and double-time vocals to remind us this is a rock band, prone to making big statements. See also \"DLZ\", a half-rap, half-primal scream from Adebimpe that sounds like its aimed at every figure of power in the world. But how do they follow that? With a big brash song about fucking. Anthemic horns and parade drums treat the whole thing like a football pep rally, \"Im gonna take you, Im gonna shake you, Im gonna make you cum.\" That could be their most transparent lyric yet.\n\"Shout Me Out\" is the only cut that reveals any unselfconscious joy. With a chorus that borrows well from Bob Dylans \"A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall\", it comes the closest to the raw sound of their past works: Repetitive guitar and a chiming synth loop introduce Adebimpe singing a gentle verse, as the song builds to a fantastic, frenetic release and the electric guitar crackles and rails along. This is familiar territory for them-- and they get out fast.\nYes, this is shit-hot thrilling music. But its also brainy and ambivalent, and more engaging for it. TV on the Radio remain a true Event Band, and the sign o the times they capture here isnt audacious hope, or fierce revolution: its confusion. Theyre the house band for a country that has no idea whatll hit it next, and Dear Science is a jagged landscape of self-doubt, Bush-hate, and future-fear. And once in a while, you still get some of their optimism. Take the first single and the albums fulcrum, \"Golden Age\", which ice skates to heaven on billowing horns, sweet swirling strings, a video that stars harmless dancing cops, and Malones falsetto. Malone has said its about \"utopia.\" And he sings like he still believes in it. But he has nothing to back him up but the beat.",

        "article_text": "Considering the amount of pre-release talk surrounding Apologies to the Queen Mary, its inevitable that reviews of Wolf Parades debut will contain bad wolf puns, Modest Mouse references (Isaac Brock recorded much of the album), riffs on Montreals music scene by those who couldnt locate the city on a map, and namechecks of the quartets pals, the Arcade Fire and Frog Eyes. Amid the noise, what Apologies might not receive is the close listening it deserves.\nTheres no question the lonesome crowded sound is here, but when Wolf Parade dig in and dust off their influences, the band rolls like a Ritalin-deprived power-Bowie or 70s Eno flexing piano-based hooks over Pixified rhythms. Component ingredients include electronics, keyboards, guitar, drums, and two spastically surging, forever tuneful vocalists (Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug), but there are also surprises: A theremin cries in the slow-poke \"Same Ghost Every Night\"-- one of the longer tracks, it grows in pageantry as it swells to the six-minute mark-- and a spot of noise-guitar echoes throughout Krugs windy \"Dinner Bells\". And unlike most participants in indie rocks million-band march, Wolf Parade makes familiar elements mesh in special ways.\nGroups like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Arcade Fire inspire listeners to both feel their music and listen closely to whats being said. Wolf Parades Boeckner and Krug sing so energetically it can be difficult transcribing, but as lyrics reveal themselves on multiple listens, Apologies is populated by ghosts, crumbled brick, haunted technology, Marcel Dzama animals, fathers and mothers, off-kilter love songs, rusted gold, and endtime/brand new world scenarios that furnish the albums ornate instrumentation and clever arrangements with an inspired if elliptical story arc.\nThe albums roughly split between Boeckner and Krug, their tracks often alternating to a tee. But there is a non-cut/dry bleed between them, with both showing up on the same song, backing each other, screaming at the same time. I wouldnt want to inspire a quarterback controversy, but I tend to be a Krug man-- to my ear, hes the more intriguing lyricist, a Bowie-inflected guy tackling nonstandard song constructions. On the other hand, Boeckner is more traditionally palatable, which may make him the favorite by consensus: His work is often less unhinged or unpredictable, and this focus allows for some of the albums most immediate standouts.\nApologies starts with Krugs mousy \"You Are a Runner and I Am My Fathers Son\"-- also included on the bands self-titled EP-- and Boeckners \"Modern World\", but it really takes off with \"Grounds for Divorce\". Honing in on one of the albums main themes, the track finds a momentary beauty and romanticism within potentially alienating technology: \"You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground/ You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town/ I said, Pretend its whales, keeping their voices down.\" Spiraling behind Krugs vocals, Boeckner mingles his guitar splashes with textured keys and a distant shout of affirmation.\nBoeckners best are the anthemic \"Shine a Light\" and his lovely, ragged closer, \"This Hearts on Fire\", which induces thoughts of the Boss in full grease-monkey Valentino mode. Krugs key tracks also come toward the albums end: the regal swagger of the Frog-Eyed \"Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts\"-- note its absolutely sublime vocal cadences and group hug-- and \"Ill Believe in Anything\", one of my favorite tunes of the year. (Diehards can scope out an eviscerated take on Krugs Sunset Rubdown album, but in either hip-shaking form its unexpectedly moving.) Tangy video-game synth, half-Moon drums, and pretty guitar reps embrace a maniacally charming Krug come-on: \"Give me your eyes, I need sunshine/ Your blood, your bones/ Your voice, and your ghost.\" Boeckners guitar distorts, the keys trill, Krug somehow finds even more energy in his pocket, and the fucker continues for another two-and-a-half blissful minutes with a shopping list of promises of escape and hope that culminates with: \"Id take you where nobody knows you/ And nobody gives a damn either way.\"\nOn paper this all could sound average, but Wolf Parades true talent is transforming the everyday into the unprecedented. Fittingly, then, the record isnt going to change the direction of modern music, but it will enrich small moments of your life-- lying in bed alone or with a loved one, the morning commute, the dancefloor, a house party.\nIf you can, block out the baggage of its built-in hype machine and take this stuff for what it is. I still remember the excitement felt when I first heard Modest Mouse more than a decade ago. At the time, my friend and I talked about how it sounded like this or like that or whatever, but beneath the snobbery and geeky influence-detecting, we were excited, and so obviously into what the band was doing. If given the chance, Wolf Parade should engender similar scenarios: In a few years, other folks will still remember where they were when they first heard Apologies to the Queen Mary.\n ",

        "article_text": "\"Can I talk my shit again?\"\nContrary to popular opinion, hubris does have a righteous appeal. Those who claim Kanye Wests antics hinder his work are missing the point. His self-importance is obvious, but the arrogance that comes pre-packaged with his insecurity is what makes West the most interesting hip-hop figure of the past five years. Thats the reason he landed on \"Oprah\" and the cover of Time Magazine last week, rather than 50 Cent or Nelly or Slug. Its not sales; its souls.\nThat said, at the end of the day, its his ear, a golden instrument, and his adventurous collaborative spirit that have made him the most fully formed artist of his genre. The sprawling Late Registration is the years most accomplished rap album, and in turn, hes done something that his heroes-- the Pharcyde and Nas, and father figure Jay-Z-- couldnt do: deliver on a promise the second time around. With the help of co-producer Jon Brion, West has taken his jumbled personae, buoyant enthusiasm, and vision for the grandiose, and transformed his chattering, seemingly unrealistic ideas into an expansive, imperfect masterpiece.\nWithout Brion, this album probably sounds a lot like its predecessor, The College Dropout-- full of tough horns, jacked soul, and flashes of brilliance. What the former Fiona Apple maestro brings to the proceedings, aside from a conductors wand and a smile, is the ability to inflate and infuse Wests ideas with even more life. A case in point is \"Hey Mama\", a track that leaked more than a year ago. The song is traditionally purty, dominated by handclaps and a flittering sample of Donal Leaces \"Today Wont Come Again\"; basically a trad-Kanye production. The Brion redux inserts a moaning vocoder, tin pan alley drums, a xylophone solo, and cascading synth coda, all without mucking up the heart in the middle.\nFlashes like this surround the sometimes urbane, often cheeky West with a new resonance. Where would \"Crack Music\", a blustery martial stomp, be without its soaring choir and biblically extended outro? Probably somewhere on the Games album. Could Kanye have single-handedly fused the showboating old school boom bap of \"We Major\" with its build-it-up and watch it all fall down production without Brion or co-producer Waryn Campbell? Not likely. By opening the studio to admired colleagues, hes allowed himself room to think even bigger than the multi-tracked \"Jesus Walks\".\nOn the mic, West sounds sharper and more battle-tested, though hell never have the effortless insouciance of Jigga or teeth-gritting religiosity of Nas. To his credit and detriment he continues to surround himself with superior MCs like Common (on the sober \"My Way Home\"), impressive newcomer Lupe Fiasco (Just Blazes life-affirming \"Touch the Sky\"), and the ineffable CamRon, who continues his magical run with savant-like witticisms on \"Gone\". Even Houstons Paul Wall manages to fit \"illuminate,\" \"insinuate,\" and \"caterpillar\" into 16 bizarre bars on the woozy \"Drive Slow\". All this to go along with curious shouts from two conflicted giants, Jay and Nas, who hang like specters over the album.\nUnlike the \"great\" hip-hop releases of yore, the productions here are so insistent that even a charismatic voice like Wests can become an afterthought. Only \"Roses\" delivers the endearing sentimentality of \"Jesus Walks\" or \"Family Business\". \"Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)\" offers some admirable if dubious political grandstanding, but as with every colossal undertaking, you gotta pay the cost to be the boss. The albums worst track, \"Bring Me Down\", overwhelms with silly orchestral pomp, courtesy of Brion. It also presumes that anyone still cares about Brandy, who sounds like shes recording her voice through a Cuisinart. \"Celebration\", too, is a busy, empty exercise in, well, celebrating.\nBarring those two tracks, and a few innocuous if unnecessary skits about a fraternity for the financially impaired called Broke Phi Broke, the rest is aces. \"Addiction\" is unsophisticated in concept but inspired in delivery. \"Gold Digger\" is also simple but not subtle, tearing into the realm of the obvious with a Ray Charles-aping Jamie Foxx and recycled drums, but succeeding with humor and reverence. Opener \"Heard Em Say\" might be the most bandied about joint here, thanks to the presence of Maroon 5s Adam Levine, but guess what? He sounds great. Off-key and blue-eyed selling his soul, but like nearly every risk here, the syrupy pop works.\n\"We all self-conscious\" has not taken on a new meaning post-Dropout. Conjecture about West revolutionizing the sound of modern hip-hop is mostly a fallacy. Not much has changed, though a few Brion hacks might appear to offer someone like Cassidy an oboe loop or two. In general, what makes Wests sound and personality so vital is that it is completely singular. The maddening contradiction, the goofball ridiculousness, and the furious fist-raising still comprise an original voice. Though youll notice I hesitate to use the phrase \"everyman\" to describe West. Not every man could have written a headphones album thatll rattle your trunk.\n ",

        "article_text": "Theres plenty to like about Astro Coast, the debut LP from the youthful Floridians in Surfer Blood, but first and foremost its a great guitar album. So what exactly does that mean these days? Often, its a reference to either a display of astounding technical chops or innovative use of tone and texture, qualities which, to be quite honest, arent particularly present here. This is a great guitar album in the way Weezers Blue Album, Built to Spills Keep It Like a Secret, or, more recently, Japandroids Post-Nothing are: six-strings serve as a multiplier for hooks, making it every bit as easy and fun to air guitar with as it is to sing along to.\nNowhere is this more true than on their breakout single \"Swim\", which spent the second half of last year generating so much praise that it threatened to make any future album unnecessary or future hype redundant. But even after so many listens, its snowblind-ish reverb is still disorienting-- especially contrasted with its crisp, power-chord hook. It may sound like theyre hitting you with their best shot, but after an impassioned \"oh oh oh!\" from singer John Paul Pitts, Surfer Blood explodes into an even bigger chorus and \"Swim\" becomes almost overpoweringly fist-pumping.\nWhile \"Swim\" might just remind you of any number of Buzz Bin one-offs now stocking whatevers left of the used-CD store racket, Astro Coast has a strong supporting cast. Throughout, even the titles remark upon how each couldve evolved from a killer guitar part into a full-on song-- \"Floating Vibes\", \"Harmonix\", \"Neighbour Riffs\". \"Floating Vibes\" lumbers with a chest-puffing, two-chord stomp that could evoke either Angus Young or Stephen Malkmus, before the guitars dovetail-- one chiming and light, the other a vocal-leading riff that makes Pitts handling of the melodic contours sound effortless. The melodic intuitiveness of Astro Coast is in large part due to the interplay heard on \"Floating Vibes\"-- if every riff is stand-alone hummable, then the vocals take care of themselves.\nSurfer Blood know from a good hook, but perhaps whats more promising is how most of their compositions build to their rewards. \"Take It Easy\" does the opposite at its outset, but by its midpoint the fidgety rhythms cool to a mesmerizing motorik thats continued on \"Harmonix\". \"Slow Jabroni\" is lonesome and crowded, distorted acoustics serving as a dusty backdrop for Pitts Isaac Brock-ian carny barking. The riff that introduces \"Anchorage\" is as blunt as its sentiments (\"I dont want to spin my wheels/ I dont got no wheels to spin\"), but its second half unfurls a major-key riff that evokes the roomier compositions of Dinosaur Jr. Putting the records two longest songs back-to-back might not be the canniest bit of sequencing, but it shows the confidence Surfer Blood have in their ability to escape the confines of three-minute power-pop.\nThough they hail from West Palm Beach and come at the tail-end of 2009s indie feel-good beach party, for all of the oceanic imagery that the band name, album title, and cover art convey, Astro Coast is lyrically landlocked and lonely. Pitts is straightforward when hes not being shrouded by the springy reverb favored by the Shins James Mercer, and at points, he reads pointedly early-00s emo. Topics of concern include confusion about romance, confusion about friendship, confusion about the future, confusion about religion. Its hard not to think that most of Astro Coast was borne of a relationship dissolved by distance, especially if were to take the otherwise chipper \"Twin Peaks\" at face value: Pitts travels to Syracuse, watches David Lynch films, and wrenches out lyrics of sexual frustration that suggest most of the drive was spent listening to Pinkerton.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Surfer Blood spent the latter part of 2009 touring with Japandroids, who, along with BOAT and Cymbals Eat Guitars align in a faux-genre some of us have jokingly referred to as \"alt-bro\"-- guitar-heavy indie rock thats probably influenced by Pavement, likely about girls, and almost certainly made by people who at first blush sound more fun to get a beer with than, say, Dirty Projectors. But its unfair to think of Astro Coast as reactionary in some way to the more overtly ambitious indie stars of last year-- there are no chamber sections, no pocket harmonies, no integration of West African rhythms (ok, theres some of that). But ambition can just as easily manifest itself as a desire to create a relentlessly catchy, \"classic indie\" album in your own dorm room, and if thats what Surfer Blood set out to do, Astro Coast succeeds wildly.",

        "article_text": "Dependable isnt a glamorous adjective for a musician, and reliability doesnt sell a lot of records, but Will Oldham, through his arsenal of aliases, has been creating consistently good music for nearly two decades. At least once a year, he releases an album, EP, mini-LP, or collaboration-- and its almost always worth hearing. At his worst, he drops a bomb like The Brave \u0026 the Bold, his covers album with Tortoise; at his best, as on his defining 1999 album I See a Darkness (recorded under the name Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy), he completely uproots American musical traditions. The upside is a career with an even trajectory-- rising only slightly but never falling off-- and the freedom to chase any rabbit he wants. The downsides: His albums all sell about the same; his audience, while loyal, neither grows nor dwindles; his followers (Iron \u0026 Wine, Pinetop Seven) sometimes surpass him; and his presence within indie rock generally comforts rather than excites.\nAt first blush, the most interesting aspect of Oldhams latest album (another as Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy) is its Raconteurish release strategy. Emphasizing digital downloads over jewel-cased CDs, Drag City rushed it to stores with little warning and nothing in the way of a promo blitz, bypassing critics previews, promotional mp3s, and all the rigmarole that typically sells an indie album. Similar endeavors by more mainstream acts have yielded disappointing returns, but Oldhams audience will seek him out. And while Lie Down in the Light may not actually change his career arc, it should find a very loyal listenership beyond his fans.\nFor such a reliable artist, Lie Down in the Light is good enough to be actually exciting, perhaps Oldhams best since Darkness, which could be its evil twin. If that 10.0-worthy record plumbed the bleakness of life, Light finds peace in the modest pleasures of friends, family, and music. \"I like the places where the night does not mean an end,\" he sings on \"You Remind Me of Something (The Glory Goes)\", \"Where smiles break free and surprise is your friend/ And dancing goes on in the kitchen until dawn/ To my favorite song that has no end.\" At times on this album, Oldham sounds like hes found just that place.\nMusically, these meticulously crafted songs-- produced by Mark Nevers of Lambchop-- give the impression of front-porch spontaneity, their purposefulness made to sound like serendipity. Oldham mines many of the same musical veins as he has on previous albums-- these songs are heavy with old gospel, country, folk, and other Americana sounds-- but he tweaks them in new ways, adding twists and turns that even some of his most ardent fans may not expect. The free-wheeling \"Easy Does It\" opens the album with a churchly jangle in which Oldhams band (which includes mainstays Paul Oldham and Emmett Kelly, along with scads of Nashville musicians) trade solos. A Bakersfield guitar passes the plate to a barrelhouse piano, which yields to a melodica, and all the while Oldham hums like hes in a jug band. Its as if the instruments were introducing themselves so youll recognize them in later songs, but that doesnt account for the clarinet that goes off on a wild tear on \"For Every Field Theres a Mole\", adding a jazzy element that sends the song careering in a new direction, namely a rewrite of Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (\"To every thing there is a season...\"). Similarly, a mournful pedal steel punctuates \"You Want That Picture\", and the ambient woodwinds and percussive acoustic guitar give \"(Keep Eye on) Others Gain\" an almost psychedelic sensibility.\nLie Down may be Oldhams most country record of new songs in years, and its also one of his most accessible and least academic records. In its loose narrative-- of a relationship forged and broken, and of lives reassured-- the Loretta Lynn to his Conway Twitty is Ashley Webber, whose full-throated, feminine roar contrasts with Oldhams old-man croon. \"So Everyone\", with its solemn horns and ratchety percussion (either a washboard or spoons), relates the excitement of new love through a plea for public oral sex, but theres neither a giggly nudge nor an admission of transgressiveness. In fact, the song sounds positively romantic. Of course, their second duet, \"You Want That Picture\", portrays a romance in shambles, each accusing the other of betrayal in a he-said/she-said dialogue.\nOldham certainly sees a darkness, but Lie Down ends basking in holy light. A Baptist organ illuminates the hymnlike closer \"Ill Be Glad\", a paean to Gods own reliability. As it reaches its final refrain, a full choir joins Oldham for a few short, sweet chords that serve as a sort of benediction. Coming at the end of an album full of moral, romantic, and sexual gray areas, those closing notes sound genuinely redemptive-- not just a preordained conclusion, but a powerful and hard-won finale. If Lie Down in the Light sounds like the distillation of the themes and sounds Oldham has been tinkering with throughout his career, the result, as he sings on \"Easy Does It\", is \"good earthly music singing into my head.\"",

        "article_text": "Last years American Weekend, Katie Crutchfields piercing debut as Waxahatchee, got passed around like a secret. On the surface, it was a modest record-- 11 lo-fi acoustic songs written and recorded in the span of a week while snowed in at her parents neighborless Alabama home near the body of water from which the project takes its name. Chronicling missed connections and cell phones smashed in moments of frustration, it was an album-length meditation on the modern allure of going off the grid (the first song was called \"Catfish\", but it wasnt about that). But what gutted you was a voice that cut through the murk like infomercial shower cleaner. Crutchfield sang frankly (\"I think I love you, but youll never find out\") and without inhibition, as if she desperately wanted but didnt expect to be heard.\nCerulean Salt, Crutchfields new album, is going to be heard. But from its opening moments, you get the sense that shes ready for it, the newfound assurance, steadiness, and clarity of her voice immediately obvious. \"We are late, we are loud, we remain connected as youre reading out loud,\" she sings on the smolderingly evocative opener, \"Hollow Bedroom\". Like American Weekend, it begins with just a guitar and a voice, though this time the instruments plugged in and the recording sounds more professional. (It was still recorded at home, this time in the Philadelphia house she shares with her sister and bandmates.) But its no less intimate-- if anything, the clean recording only brings you in tighter. Crutchfields voice rises to be heard over the distortion that kicks in during the songs final minute. \"And I dont believe that I care at all,\" she sings with quiet defiance. \"What they hear through these walls.\"\nSince her early teens, Crutchfield has been a precocious, prolific songwriter, and now that shes in her early 20s, shes already a veteran of a number of short-lived projects: an early solo act called King Everything, plus a few melodic punk bands she played in with her twin sister, Swearin frontwoman Allison, including Bad Banana, the Ackleys, and P.S. Eliot. Crutchfield hails from Alabama-- a fact thats stamped all over her voices twangy swagger-- but her songs have a drifters perspective that suggest that, in a sense, shes also come from everywhere. Her music is partially about being young and on the road, what happens in those rare cases when teenage wanderlust is not a suburban daydream, but an everyday reality.\nCerulean Salt is full of vagrant wisdom and people who might once have hitchhiked across the country but were born into a moment when they could just join a punk band instead. They crash on shitty group house floors, cram their gear and bodies into vans with questionable, unexplained \"blood on the back seat,\" and shirk from commitment whenever feelings are anything more than fleeting.  \"Ill try to embrace the lows,\" she sings on \"Coast to Coast\", a song whose buoyant static makes the most of her new band members (Kyle Gilbride and Keith Spencer from Swearin add bass and drums). \nCrutchfield has a way of delivering a line so casually that it takes a half-dozen listens to fully realize how devastating it is. \"I had a dream last night, we had hit separate bottoms,\" she sings, a brilliant, crushing line hidden in the middle of the gently strummed \"Lively\". Her songs paint scenes in quick, deft strokes thanks to her knack for knowing exactly which physical details will carry emotional resonance. Theres something almost unbearably poignant about the wedding reception she describes where \"make-up sets on [the brides] face like tar\" and \"the champagne flutes poorly engineered, employ dixie cups and jars.\"\nMarriage, tradition, and lineage are all sources of great anxiety in a Waxahatchee song. There was a track on American Weekend about a grandmother, with the repeated refrain, \"You got married when you were 15,\" uttered with disbelief, as though Crutchfield were trying to imagine how different her own life would be had the same been true for her. These themes are explored in more depth on Cerulean Salt; in \"Swan Dive\" she confesses that \"dreams about loveless marriage and regret\" keep her up at night, while she presents a peers wedding as more of a \"tragic epilogue\" than a celebration on \"Dixie Cups and Jars\" (which feels like a slightly more harrowing take on Built to Spills \"Twin Falls\"). \"You’ll remain,\" she says to her, \"I will find a way to leave gracefully, or Ill escape.\" Where shell go isnt clear, but its these free-floating desires and unanswered questions that give Crutchfields songs their haunting power.\n\"This place is vile, and Im vile too,\" Crutchfield howls on the stunning closer, \"Youre Damaged\". In the hands of a lesser singer, a line like that might feel too exposed. But Crutchfields characters cant help but be exactly who they say they are: theyre catfish in a Catfish world. And as they squirm, flop, and clumsily make their way through their lives, their specific experiences become something universal. \"For me, the only way to write lyrics is not to think about other people at all,\" Crutchfield said in a recent interview. \"You just have to write stuff for you and only you, and not worry about how people are going to take it. Itll be inevitably relatable because its true to you.\" It’s that blazingly honest, hyper-personal quality that places Cerulean Salt in the tradition of Elliott Smith, early Cat Power, or Liz Phairs free-flowing Girlysound tapes-- the work of a songwriter skilled enough to make introspection seem not self-centered, but generous.",

        "article_text": "So much for cleaning up their sound for Matador. After two releases on the recently returned Siltbreeze label, Times New Viking have become better songwriters, but thankfully dont change much of anything from their humble home-recorded beginnings. An effusive press release for Rip It Off draws a line from the Sex Pistols through Slanted and Enchanted and Alien Lanes to end at these guys and girls, and while those claims are a bit too bold to take at face value, they make a certain kind of sense: The Pistols ended up holding the banner for all the bands who realized they could do it themselves, and the songs written by Pavement and especially Guided By Voices swelled with the pride that their basement tapes could stand ably next to their heroes carefully constructed classics.\nThat DIY spirit is key to Times New Viking, but theres a different sort of reclamation going on here. Yes, the instruments sound like off-brand department store toys, the speaker cones are blown-out, and the recording equipment is rudimentary. Theyre noisy enough to put off even fans of the 90s \"lo-fi\" generation. But every chord, every note, every yelped vocal, every grizzled and treble-tearing tone is one of sheer exuberance-- they may act aloof, but TNV get off on the privilege of just making a sound.\nIn a time when technology makes professional-sounding recordings accessible to even the smallest bands, that exuberance is refreshing and becoming rarer. TNV continue to straddle a sort of middle ground that might be too melodic and structured for real noise fans and too sludgy for indie-pop shut-ins, but by honing the hooks a little more, Rip It Off leans ever so slightly towards the latter. It doesnt rock as hard as the bands debut, nor does it have anything quite as instantly memorable as \"Teenage Lust!\", but its their most satisfying front-to-back listen.\nOn the surface, this is simply another batch of lo-fi indie-pop songs, but the band refines the lessons of earlier records and improves on them, all congealing into a capital-A album. The clumsy thwack of \"Come Together\" recalls the swagger of their debut, while the irrepressibly cheerful \"Rip Allegory\" and \"The Early 80s\" are unabashed pop hewn from lazy arpeggios, bubbling one-finger organ riffs, and desperately shouted boy/girl vocals. \"The Wait\", with its deliberate tempo and sing-along chorus, is TNVs most discernible anthem yet, but they mostly stand their scuzzy ground-- the slow echoing notes of \"Relevant: Now\", and all their attendant feedback, cements the group as self-lacerating rockstars; too seasoned to avoid writing pop songs, but still too smart to take them seriously.\nThe layer of fuzz works like a security blanket-- a way of creating not just a distinctive sound, but of putting up an awning of safety over them and their listeners. Only the slightest bit of straining brings you to the pop virtues of these songs, on the bands own terms. Sure, its an affectation, but its just another way of using the studio as an instrument in a way that makes these songs more intimate by design-- for better or worse, you cant sell a Volkswagen with a Times New Viking song. If cleaner production means truckloads of new bands who can summon their influences with little effort, and even less enthusiasm or creativity, then Ill stick with my tinnitus, thanks.",

        "article_text": "The inside cover of Philip Jecks seventh solo album (typically great Jon Wozencroft design) contains a nice quote from critic Mort Goode: \"Johnny Mathis advances the art of remembering.\" I dont hear Mathis on 7 (though he could be here somewhere-- with Jeck you never know) but I imagine these words appear because The Art of Remembering would be a great title for a Philip Jeck album. For most of the 20th Century, the phonograph record was the primary time-based storage medium. You could buy pre-made 8mm and 16mm reels, but home films never had the market penetration of recorded sound. Music, speeches, plays, sound effects, sporting events, even film storylines were preserved and sold on records.\nThe vinyl record was one of the primary devices for storing cultures collective memory. Hundreds of millions of these fragments were strewn all around the world. What happened to all these chunks of data? Most decayed or were rendered obsolete and were tossed out, but plenty are still in circulation, and a good number of them wound up in Philip Jecks record collection. Jeck makes music by playing, mixing and processing vinyl records (mostly obscure ones), and on 7, he reflects our memories back to us in a profound and terribly exciting way. Here, Jeck is at the peak of his creative powers.\nThe first track \"Wholesome\" shows how damn pretty Jeck can sound when so inclined. You expect pieces built from old manipulated vinyl and loops to be prickly with a disturbing undercurrent, but \"Wholesome\", which isolates, stretches and repeats a Disneyfied swirl of night sky strings and impressionistic piano plinks, is like a flower in perpetual bloom. It gets distorted and blacker toward the end when Jeck rolls off the treble completely, but thats just the sun setting and, like e.e. cummings said, if it has to happen, this is a beautiful way. \"Wipe\" is just as lovely with a different feel, distant and lonely instead of warm and welcoming. It reminds me of Experimental Audio Research circa \"Tribute to John Cage in C*A*G*E\", music for drifting slow through space, a cold drone echoing in an asteroids cave.\n\"Now You Can Let Go\" is where Jeck robs the memory bank for identifiable fragments. He turns crackly loops of locomotive chugs into percussion, pushes corny three-note jazz phrases nicked from a Steamboat Willie short into a dub chamber, and keeps a recording of a lathe humming along to bind it all into a singular sound machine. \"Some Pennies\" is doubly referential, as the ghostly bass ostinato looping through was also the central element of (the even more powerful) \"Vinyl Coda I\", recorded in 1999. Its an ominous piece of music, but somehow never threatens; despite its bleak overtone, \"Some Pennies\" is subtle and invites intimate observation. You want to inch closer and pick the piece apart, each layer of sound folded inside, a world within a world.\nI like to think of \"Bush Hum\" as a reference to our president and the violence thats accompanied his term in office, though the sleeve notes indicate that the sole sound source for the track is the ungrounded hum of a Bush turntable run through a delay pedal. Still, the abrasive, atonal buzz generated by Jecks processed electrical circuit could stand in for the sounds of war. An atypical track for a man whose music always incorporates the friction of the physical, \"Bush Hum\" is nonetheless very effective. Closing the album is the 10-minute veil, a slowly evolving rumble of Wagnerian strings, the symphonic loops of Zauberberg Gas without the kickdrum. How did Johnny Mathis say it in 1957? Oh yeah, \"Wonderful! Wonderful!\"\n ",

        "article_text": "Man, that Wavves \"meltdown\" really bummed me out. Not because a rising lo-fi rocker acted stupidly-- who doesnt sometimes?-- but because Id always imagined being on ecstasy in Barcelona would be a lot more fun. After all, some of the most rewarding music from the last couple of years basically promised as much. Or was Swedish imprint Sincerely Yours being insincere? How about U.S. labels True Panther and Underwater Peoples? From Oslo to Melbourne, from indie rockers to club kids, sunny electronic euphoria has been one of the late-2000s pop undergrounds richest musical nodes.\nJust as that endless blissed-out summery vibe unites everyone from Panda Bear to Todd Terje, Barcelona electro-pop four-piece Delorean pull up at the intersection between several disparate and exciting movements. Start with their remixes: In the U.S., the bedroom pop of Glasser and disco-punk of Lemonade; in the UK, the NME-approved guitar rock of the Big Pink and Mystery Jets; and, right in Deloreans hometown, the sample-heavy tropical psych of El Guincho. They can be as airy and suave as Air France or Phoenix, but their unremitting beats are also plenty huge enough to convert fans of Cut Copy or MGMT. John Talabot, a Barcelona DJ whos released cosmic disco grooves for Munich label Permanent Vacation, lends a house remix to the groups current EP, Ayrton Senna.\nThe third release on Fool House, the new label from French indie-dance blog Fluo Kids, Ayrton Senna represents a similar kind of convergence. In the early 2000s, Delorean originally set out to be something like Jimmy Eat World crossed with Elliott Smith, keyboardist Unai Lazcano confided to The Pop Manifesto magazine last summer. By the time of their promising Transatlantic KK album a couple of years ago, Delorean had absorbed the synth-pop sleekness of New Order and the echoey guitar spikes of post-punk revivalists like !!! or the Rapture, with one transcendent moment: so-called \"breakhop\" finale \"Apocalypse Ghetto Blast\". On the Ayrton Senna EP, the groups burgeoning dance-pop savvy comes into bloom with three unstoppable summer bangers, the Talabot remix, and a digital-only bonus cut.\nDespite their rock roots, Delorean do tracks, not songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi is a Ph.D. candidate with a background in philosophy, but Delorean use his Factory-ready yelp more as just another element to loop than as a vehicle for delivering lyrical content. \"Seasun\" is the best example of Deloreans layered approach to composition, methodically building 1990s piano-house keyboards, disembodied female vocals, Baltimore club-ready handclaps, and a ringing guitar line into the ultimate beach house (not Beach House). But \"Deli\", with its breakbeats and youthful enthusiasm, and \"Moonson\", all 90s-house liberation and anthem-rock yearning, are almost as thrilling. Talabots \"Kids \u0026 Drum\" remix of \"Seasun\" could well hold up after even more listens than the original version, its hand-percussion samples reaching closer to the islands but its vast, clean lines stretching out toward space.\nPrior to Ayrton Senna, arguably Deloreans most compelling release was its remix for oft-misunderstood electro-pop Serge Gainsbourgs the Teenagers. On last years occasionally brilliant Reality Check, the French bands \"Love No\" is a hilarious, sleazy, and brutally scathing snipe at a nagging girlfriend who disapproves of the narrators self-absorbed internet stonerdom. Deloreans bass-heavy \"No Love\" version-- like Studios \"Possible\" rework of the Shout Out Louds \"Impossible\", only more dramatic-- strips away all the negative lyrics, ditching a chorus of \"Im not in love\" and instead repeating the big question: \"Are you in love?\" Well, thats a hell of a thing for a pop song to ask. The track promises dancefloor absolution, only to nag at the heart in a way the Teenagers lame girlfriend never could.\nSummer always ends too soon, and before long Im sure beachy dance music will sound as cloying as rock fans considered the Beach Boys by the late 1960s. Like Wavves in Barcelona, Delorean recognize theres a dark side to their ecstatic vision, the aching truth that utopia-- literally, \"no place\"-- can never totally be fulfilled. As equally impressive bonus track \"Big Dipper\" puts it: \"Babe, if you want to we could run away up into the sun/ But we would only fade from black to black.\" Deloreans similarities to other \"sunny\", \"shimmering\" new artists, ultimately, are far less important than their similarities to other practitioners of well-crafted and instantly gripping pop.",

        "article_text": "The Walkmen are kings of dejection. For about a decade now, theyve turned their albums into symphonies of disappointment and resentment and regret. Their proudest moments, then, are also their most down-and-out. Their best song, \"The Rat\", is a world-weary, old-before-its-time rager, a song from a young guy seeing that hes already falling out of step with the universe and feeling pissed about it. Their second-best song, \"In the New Year\", sounds triumphant and optimistic at first, but on further listens it reveals itself to be as much a plea as anything else, a secular prayer that shit just please start working out right. The specific brand of desperation that the band conjures is miles away from, say, the throbbing, dread-laced depression of fellow dapper New Yorkers the National. The Walkmen are more theatrical and unwound than that-- theyre the guys out in the middle of the street, screaming up at the sky, begging to know why everything always falls apart.\nIn that elegantly disheveled mutter-wail thing of his, frontman Hamilton Leithauser starts new album Lisbon off by singing: \"Youre with someone else tomorrow night/ Doesnt matter to me/ Cause as the sun dies into the hill/ You got all I need.\" Hes sad and pathetic and needy and yet somehow still smooth, which is sort of the central animating paradox at the heart of the Walkmen. They make these wounded, anxious songs, but they make them so confidently, with such unearthly rich-guy assurance. The bands specific style of indie rock is very rooted in a scrappy, scratchy New York tradition that dates back to the Velvet Underground or Bob Dylan, but their take on it is theirs and theirs alone. You know one of their songs right away when those winding, circular guitars and surging drums and gargling vocals kick in. Theyre so performative in their sadness, but that stuff never rankles or comes off tantrumy, since the band is just so good at this stuff. Theres a song on Lisbon called \"Woe Is Me\", and its not even remotely a joke. Great song, too.\nThis is a band that cares deeply about things like microphone placement, and so everything sounds just unbelievably crisp and warm-- except when its not supposed to, as on the purposefully weird, strangulated two-minute panic attack \"Follow the Leader\". And even though they sound very much like themselves throughout, there are some great variations in here. \"Stranded\" uses beaten-down mariachi horns to massively graceful effect. \"Victory\" (which, naturally, is about never achieving victory) has the same sort of blood-pounding chorus that \"The Rat\" does. \"Torch Song\" is a song about a song, about not knowing the right song to \"calm down all the madness,\" but the amber Twin Peaks Angelo Badalamenti fuzz on the track is just heart-stopping gorgeous. The Walkmen know what theyre doing here.\nIn early interviews, Leithauser claimed that Lisbon got its sonic inspiration from ancestral Sun Records rockabilly. That influence never makes itself overtly known, but there are a few slick little old-school nods here and there, like the relentless Tennessee Three train-chug rhythm on \"Blue as Your Blood\", or the ahh-ahh backing vocals on \"All My Great Designs\". More than that, theres an economic speed and simplicity at work here; the songs might be reflective self-lacerating wallows, but theyre fast wallows. Drummer Matt Barrick tends to play just off the beat, but he hits his drums just incredibly hard, with the sort of crisp wallop you feel in your teeth fillings. On the albums big, transcendent, loud moments, his crash cymbals sound like fists raining down on you from heaven, and hes still very much a force even on the quieter songs.\nAnd that brings us to \"Angela Surf City\", the song on this album that deserves a place alongside \"The Rat\" and \"In the New Year\". It starts off tense and withdrawn, Leithauser singing about some relationship without ever letting us in on what, exactly, is going on. Underneath, theres a tense, withdrawn surf-rock beat. And when the chorus starts to well up, the music underneath keeps surging upward, becoming huger than anything the song should be able to handle, then getting even huger from there, as Barrick lets off relentless Bonham-level thundercracks. Leithauser sings guarded, terse stuff that I dont necessarily understand, but he wails it so hard that it comes out anthemic: \"You took the high road! I couldnt find you!\" The Walkmen play with restraint, and they dont usually allow themselves earth-shaking moments like that. But when those moments come, theyre enough to send you spinning.",

        "article_text": "One of the most interesting things about the Tough Alliance is the Swedish duos relationship to optimism. TTA dont make songs about being happy; they make songs about wanting to be happy. Theyre as troubled as anyone else, but in line with the effervescent nature of their music, they simply refuse to wallow in bad feelings. When on 2007s A New Chance, Eric Berglund pleaded, \"dont you die yet\" and pointed out that \"theres something else... something bright and pure that youve never felt before,\" it wasnt naïve positivity. This was a guy struggling with fear and depression and trying his damndest to stay hopeful.\nWhen we talked to Berglund recently about his solo project ceo, it sounded like he may have found some peace. \"[I have] a profound sense of belonging that will always stay with me no matter what happens... a feeling that I only dreamt of until a while ago\", he said. So if TTA records were about holding on to hope no matter the cost, then the first ceo album, White Magic, is about achieving lasting contentment. Berglund says as much in the track \"Oh God Oh Dear\": \"I finally touched life and it was all so clear.\"\nThat emotional clarity matches the albums sharp songcraft. As ever, Berglunds music has a remarkable sense of melody, and White Magic has the same tidy precision that initially set TTA apart. Theres an understanding of hooks and pop structure here that almost seems only available to the Swedish. The record isnt completely made up of the pulsing electro-pop that youd expect-- there are some lush orchestral pieces sprinkled in-- but each track is put together carefully with a keen sense of how the pieces fit together. To take one example, \"Illuminata\" is one of the more overtly danceable numbers on the record, and its as big a pop song as anything by Phoenix, Vampire Weekend, or any other hook-friendly indie band out there.\nBerglund also gets how melody fits into club music. Since we first came to know him and TTA, theres been a big uptick in the number of groups having a go at the sort of gentle Mediterranean disco often described as \"Balearic.\" But Berglund and his Sincerely Yours crew understand this sound on another plane. Alongside friend and labelmate Kendal Johannson, who helped record the LP, he seamlessly marries the Balearic style with pop. Lead single \"Come With Me\" is a clinic on how to do this, constructing a blinding surface sheen that allows the song to function underneath. But theres also darker, less buoyant stuff here: opener \"All Around\" is loose and string-driven and the sinister title track has an almost Depeche Mode vibe.\nThe range of moods reinforces the records overall theme-- its mostly upbeat, but there are traces of doubt and longing that suggest Berglund has a ways to go before feeling truly at ease. Its easy to connect with the emotional side of the album since everyone can identify with wanting to be happier. But thats only half the appeal. Its also totally possible to ignore all that and just lose yourself in the effortlessness of these songs. At just eight tracks in fewer than 30 minutes, White Magic is tantalizingly short, and Sincerely Yours notorious secrecy makes it hard to say if there will ever be a follow-up. One-off or not, though, its pretty obvious that ceo is the real deal.",

        "article_text": "Ben Frost’s interests are vast, and that includes the way he approaches his music. The Australia-born, Iceland-based composer has written scores for dance companies, soundtracked films, and collaborated with visual artists and poets. He cast himself as a kind of endurance artist on the cover of his 2007 album Theory of Machines and, in 2013, directed his own theatrical adaption of Iain Banks’ novel The Wasp Factory. Frost also co-produced experimental saxophonist Colin Stetson’s New History Warfare, Volume 3 in 2013, played “fire” on Swans’ The Seer a year earlier, and is an important collaborator for Tim Hecker. Outside the studio, he’s articulate when discussing what he’s doing, loading comments about his work with heavy concepts and meaning: his interviews fold in references to biology, astronomy, literature, nature, art, professional basketball. For all this, his music is equally fascinating when you strip away the context and simply let the sounds he’s making overtake you.\nFrost’s latest album, A U R O R A, offers his best example yet of this sort of aural suffocation. The uptick could partly be due to a new approach: Unlike his past work, there are no guitars, piano, or stringed instruments; instead, the 41-minute collection focuses on synthesizers and the heavy percussion of ex-Liturgy drummer and current Guardian Alien leader Greg Fox, Swans’ Thorr Harris, and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. A U R O R A is, in a sense, the proper companion to 2009’s excellent By the Throat, but it’s shaggier and more intense. Still, Frost is able to maintain a sense of spaciousness amid the feedback.\nThat feeling of distance coincides with the facts of A U R O R A’s creation: Frost wrote most of the collection on a laptop while working with photographer/filmmaker Richard Mosse in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. (Mosse and cinematographer Trevor Tweeten, in turn, made a series of grainy films—explosions, volcanoes, bullets through bodies—as a rollout to A U R O R A, as well as the album’s cover art). He also recorded in Empac, New York, and Reykjavik—where he mixed the record with Valgeir Sigurdsson—and somewhere along the way, Tim Hecker provided sound design and post-production work.\nDespite its scattered creation, I tend to listen to A U R O R A as one long piece, letting the different modes congeal into a whole. You hear minimalism buried in the fuzz, and it’s also easy to tell that Frost is fond of industrial, punk, and metal. Instead of the noisy, meditative openers of past outings,  A U R O R As first track, “Flex”, sounds like an airplane taking off; the steady, escalating synthesizer gives way to frantic jazz drumming partially consumed the crackling, loose wires around it. This bleeds into “Nolan”, a track that would fit easily on Tim Hecker’s Harmony in Ultraviolet, featuring a percussive thump—sticks rattling, synthesizers lapping. Like much of A U R O R A, it feels like a battle between the human and the digital, Frost’s cold synthesizers and laptops vs. his collaborators’ sweaty percussion. \nBut the album is not all violent stoicism; there’s dark humor here as well. “Diphenyl Oxalate”, a track named for the chemical used in glowsticks, hits like a black metal rave, and it’s one of a few places where Frost seems to be creating dance music, or at least music that makes your innards move. In this mode, he fits in line with producers like Container, Sandwell District, Demdike Stare, and Vatican Shadow, but he never stays in one place, and the album is filled with variety and a great sense of dynamics. The previously mentioned “Nolan” takes an Eastern turn, and mixes in wind chimes beneath a gale force surge. “No Sorrowing” is a hazy, restful drift. The warping “Sola Fide” sounds like loose wires and firecrackers, but maintains a melodic side. (In the liner notes, Eddi the Bomb is credited with “explosives.”)\nIf the album has a center, it’s “Venter”, which has a little of everything Frost does well. It opens with a blend of clean and distorted hand drums, which are joined by a distant, crystalline synthesizer that grows stronger over the first two minutes before practically being buried by the sound of bells and chimes. For the remaining four and a half minutes, these strands fluctuate, growing more intense, but also more refined. Then, at the four-minute mark, almost like offering some kind of introverted, experimental take on an EDM drop, the track gains a new kind of force and momentum on the back of whiplashing electronics. It’s an epic track, the kind of song that fills up a room.\nFrost named \"Venter\" after biologist Craig Venter, the first person to create a cell containing a synthetic genome. In an interview with Pitchfork, he said the scientist would be his dream collaborator: “It would be about getting some face time with the guy who literally synthesized life—he made life. It just makes me feel so small and insignificant.” A U R O R A can be heard as Frost’s attempt to create something physical, and it stands above the rest of his discography.",

        "article_text": "The rise of footwork as a formidable sub-genre of electronic music over the last few years has raised an interesting question: how do you listen to the stuff? On one level, the Chicago-borne sound is purely functional; its high-BPM tempos, disorienting bass lines, and hypnotically repetitive approach to sampling form the perfect soundtrack for the juke-derived footwork style of dancing, which favors fast feet and athletic skill. Near the top of this decade, footwork caught the collective ear of the always-hungry-for-something-new UK dance scene: Forward-thinking label Planet Mu delivered a smattering of footwork-associated releases near the end of 2010, including the first volume of the scene-surveying Bangs \u0026 Works compilation. Much of the footwork music created around that time was fascinating, inspiring—and, as home-listening material, maddening.\nFootworks relative inaccessibility suggested that it would become a niche concern in the constantly changing realm of dance music, but it stayed in the conversation, as solid releases from veterans of the sound, boundary-pushing newcomers, and canny genre-fusion outsiders pushed things in more musical and distinctly individual directions. All these roads lead to Double Cup, the new album from Rashad Harden, who produces as DJ Rashad. A gorgeous, invigorating collection of tracks that places equal importance on melody alongside rhythmic texture, Double Cup is unquestionably the strongest footwork-related LP since the genre was introduced to a wider audience. This stuff would kill on a dancefloor, but you dont have to watch anyones feet to appreciate whats on display here.\nDouble Cup closes out a particularly fruitful year for Rashad, a two-decade-plus veteran of the scene who started dancing juke at 12 and began honing his DJ and production skills just a few years later in the early 90s. In March, he made his debut on Hyperdub with the Rollin EP, an expressive collection that featured the astounding \"Let It Go\", a game-changer of a tune with rolling, hyperspeed drums and an evocative vocal sample; in July, he dropped another solid EP, I Dont Give a Fuck, the title track of which appears on Double Cup, too. (\"Let It Go\", a superior cut and arguably Rashads strongest track to date, is conspicuously absent here, but the records overall high level of consistency makes its exclusion a negligible gripe.)\nIronically, Double Cup achieves a new level of musicality previously untouched by footwork by jettisoning much of the genres rigid formality. This stuff is practically in Rashads blood, so his ability to dismantle the sound hes lived with for much of his life and reassemble it in a fresh and exciting way is expected as much as it is impressive. For instance, he splices in other elements of beat-fixated music—jungles frantic mania, bass musics oblong structures, the glowing synths of vintage house and techno, West Coast hip-hops honey-slathered haze—to fit a more footwork-indebted framework. Ive heard a few people compare Double Cups dizzying sampledelia to J Dillas masterwork Donuts; while the former lacks the latters cohesion and singularity of purpose, both records possess the similar thrill of hearing a master of an existent genre taking their sound to new, exciting heights.\nFootwork often sounds as handmade as it does futuristic, and being able to see the seams of tracks both imperfect and flawless is one of the genres more endearing qualities. On Double Cup, those seams are more or less nonexistent—for music that is so frequently intense and hard-hitting, many tracks here possess an impossibly smooth finish. From opening cut \"Feelin\"s twinkling sighs to the smothering sensuality of \"Let U No\", it at times sounds like Rashad has literally opened a window in footworks oxygen-sealed atmosphere. The bass lines smack as hard as ever, but theyre placed lower in the mix rather than serving as these tracks central axis, creating a more varied sonic topography thats also easier on the ears.\nFootworks practitioners tend to congregate in scenes, and Rashad is no different: hes a founding member of the Teklife crew, whose logo is emblazoned on Double Cups packaging, and hes also a part of the largely elder-statesmen Ghettoteknicianz outfit. Accordingly, Double Cup is collaborative—\"I Dont Give a Fuck\" and the harrowing weed anthem \"Reggie\" are the sole Rashad solo cuts here—with DJs and frequent collaborators Spinn (whose very good LP from earlier this year, TEKLIFE Vol. 2: What You Need, makes for a nice companion to this record), Manny, Earl, and Phil pitching in on additional beats and the occasional rap cadence.\nIts also a largely Midwestern record, and its sole misstep occurs in the form of a collaboration with a non-regional artist: UK producer Addison Groove, whose 2010 single \"Footcrab\" was instrumental in introducing footworks genetic material to bass music. His and Rashads \"Acid Bit\" is an intriguing curiousity, with plenty of the acidic synth work that the name implies, but ultimately the tune is a disruption to the albums already-nebulous flow. Which raises the other caveat regarding Double Cup: listening to footwork in long stretches can be exhilarating, and exhilaration can often lead to exhaustion. The record runs 51 minutes long, and since it resembles less a properly structured album and more an expertly curated collection of tracks, its best taken in smaller bursts for maximal effect.\nThe greater Chicago area has frequently been at the forefront of left-of-center sounds that have bubbled up, from the coruscating rock deconstructivism of Shellac and Big Black, to Gastr del Sols amorphous genre fusion, to Frankie Knuckles still-standing reign as \"The Godfather\" of house music. The past few years, especially, have provided a few fresh and unfamiliar sounds in regional hip-hop and dance music, and Double Cup is the latest testament to the wellspring of ingenuity that Chicagos recent musical culture has to offer. For Rashad, its a defining statement 20-plus-years in the making, a brilliant document that puts him in the position any veteran would kill to occupy: instead of looking back at the past, now its all about where he takes his sound next.",

        "article_text": "Like plenty of other bands in the internet era, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart seem poised to attract an audience that will far outstrip that of their easily identifiable precedents-- in their case, groups like Rocketship or Shop Assistants, each obscure these days even by Approved Indie Influence standards. A few other twee/noise-pop revivalists arguably pulled off that same trick last year, but Pains of Being Pure at Heart are likely to appeal to listeners beyond online name-droppers and Brooklyn scenesters.\nThat these second-wavers are getting first-rate attention shouldnt be a worry unless youre into dick-measuring contests about the late-1980s (but I was there) or still holding a grudge against Vivian Girls and Crystal Stilts. Despite being such a streamlined listen, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart acts as something of an indie Rorschach: Once our staff got a hold of the fuzzy, major-chord fizz of \"Come Saturday\" or \"Stay Alive\", it raised comparisons to everything from Sleepyhead to Black Tambourine to even Peter Bjorn and John (at their most shoegazy) and Ride (at their most heavy-lidded). In other words, youll dig this record as long as youre a fan of trebly, melancholy pop music. Which is quite a lot of people reading this review.\nWhat distinguishes POBPAH from the rest of their modern peers is a sense of craft located in the sweet spot between wilfull amateurism masking incompetence and not gumming things up with bells and whistles. Its immediate and substantial, but initially, it can seem distracting that the band is built more for speed than muscle. Yet these arent songs that need anchors-- as much as Alex Naidus bass plays an integral role in pushing everything forward, hes more likely to contribute melodic counterpoint than low end. Kip Bermans voice is appropriately unaffected, working in melodies that almost feel like 45-degree angles-- exact, acute, and just right. Keyboardist Peggy Wang-East doesnt harmonize in a traditional sense with Berman very often, but particularly on \"Young Adult Friction\", her vocals are a hook in themselves, taking an already strong chorus to a higher plateau.\nSo yeah, theyve got the sound figured out, but what ensures that this will be something thatll make it past the point where the indie cycle of life goes on and bands are inevitably starting to cop the sounds of, say, Archers of Loaf? Regardless of the b\u0026w cover art, theres more gray matter than initially appears. The title alone of \"This Love Is Fucking Right!\" is enough to set off the sugar shock factor (its a nod to the Field Mice), and thats before the chorus which renders the f-bomb \"feckin!,\" but the invocation of \"youre my sister\" before the title is as dark as you want it to be.\n\"Stay Alive\" is the records centerpiece, boasting the most anthemic chorus; initially, it could pass for cloyingly optimistic, with bell-like keyboard pinches accenting thumbs-up signifiers like \"shoot at the sky\" and \"youll stay alive.\" But once again, after closer listens it takes a darker tone, possibly talking down a suicidal friend. Most tellingly, \"Come Saturday\" sets the stage for the rest of the record with a promise of ignoring parties for a summer wasting and spent indoors. Its every bit as heartfelt as the later lyrical nod to Another Sunny Day.\nBut then again, sincerity never made me turn up the volume. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart simply made a slyly confident debut that mixes sparkling melodies with an undercurrent of sad bastard mopery, and youre just being a dick if you think the past has some kind of patent on that. Thats just the way good pop music works.",

        "article_text": "In early 2012, the music director of a Norwegian state-funded radio station called P3 declined to add a song called \"Inspector Norse\" by disco producer Todd Terje to its rotation, saying it sounded like \"background music at a beach bar.\" When an interviewer asked him what he thought about the radio stations description, Terje said he agreed with it. \"It sounds like elevator music. Good, danceable elevator music.\" Then, in a pun fit only for hypothetical dads, he added, \"Elevate your body!\" In Terjes world, there is no distinction made between beating and joining—its all join, join, join.\nIts Album Time is, as advertised, his first full-length album. The title sets the tone: Casual, confident, and unburdened by the imagined need for significance that scares so many good dance producers into losing their cool when given a bigger platform. Most of the music on it could be classified as disco, with shades of cocktail lounge, exotica, surf instrumentals, and other styles that favor whimsy and novelty over sober artistic expression. Not that Terje isnt an artist—he is, and a careful one, fluent in history, expert with texture, and with a grasp on composition more akin to a 1960s film composer than a contemporary techno producer. But for as much ground as he covers on Its Album Time, the music feels effortless, gliding from Henry Mancini-esque detective jazz to bouncy, Stevie Wonder funk like breeze blowing through the waffle weave of a leisure suit. Conventional wisdom bears out: The looser the grip, the tighter the hold.\nDespite recycling four of its twelve tracks from previously released singles and EPs, Its Album Time has a linear, cohesive feel. Instead of trying to top \"Strandbar\" or \"Inspector Norse\", Terje ties them together with short interstitial tracks—valleys that give perspective to the mountains. If he ever capitulates to the conventions of making a full-length album, its in structure, which here is less redolent of disco than classic-rock pranksters like Paul McCartney or Frank Zappa: an introduction that features men whispering the words \"Its album time\" repeatedly, peaking with a ballad halfway through; closing with the joyous \"Inspector Norse\", and dying away to the sound of distant applause.\nTerje is, at heart, a comedian. \"I like my music very fruity,\" he told Resident Advisor in 2007. \"Lots of percussion, lots of silly effects.\" When I interviewed the illustrator Bendik Kaltenborn, who has drawn the covers for most of Terjes releases including Its Album Time, he told me that the two first bonded over what Kaltenborn called a \"Stupid\" sense of humor. Everything about Its Album Time and Terjes self-presentation—whether its the fart-like synth sounds, the conga-line enthusiasm, or the promo photos of him flexing his minor biceps with a pout on his face—is so studiously carefree that he sometimes seems less like a human being than an all-night party incarnate.  \nBut like all comedy, Terjes act is held together by a taut thread of sadness. The beauty of his music is the beauty of a neon sign outside a cheap motel: Its kitschy but it knows it, and in its kitsch conveys both loneliness (its dark outside and youve been driving for hours) and its easy resolution (its warm inside and happy hour never ends, pink paper umbrella gratis). In the mockumentary-style video for Terjes \"Inspector Norse\" (which is excerpted from a Norwegian short film called Whateverest), a failed electronic musician living with his elderly father in a small town spends a day bowling and cooking drugs from household chemicals before turning out the lights and dancing to \"Inspector Norse\", alone. Afterwards, he wanders the streets in facepaint, confused, crying. He survives mostly on illusions, and without happy music, hed be lost.\nThe albums least representative song is the one that sticks with me the most: A cover of the Robert Palmer ballad \"Johnny and Mary,\" sung by Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry. The song is heavy, melancholic, and almost oppressively romantic—moods that the rest of Its Album Time feel designed to make you forget about. The lyrics tell the story of a couple who know theyre alienated from each other but have hung on for so long they struggle with whether or not to break up. \"Johnnys always running around, trying to find certainty,\" the opening line goes. \"He needs all the world to confirm that he aint lonely/ Mary counts the walls, knows he tires easily.\"\nFerry has spent his entire career crying crocodile tears, exploring the ways a seemingly insincere performance can ring with more feeling and pathos than something we recognize as \"real\". His voice—once a dazzling, cartoonish instrument, like Elvis with his finger in a wall socket—sounds hollowed-out and whispery, an old man whose wisdom brings him no comfort. In the original song, Palmer seems to hover above the characters, observing them, maybe even judging. Ferry sounds like hes in the next room, suffering troubles of his own.\nAs the song crests and the rippling arpeggios of Terjes synths reach their climax, you might wonder: What is a song so sad doing on an album so relentlessly upbeat? Not to ruin the mood, I think—only as a reminder that sadness is a choice. You could be \"Inspector Norse\" if you wanted to, peacocking wild across the dancefloor, spilling drinks on a stranger, recognizing the brevity of life by enjoying it. From an artist like Terje, its proof that he could go deep if he wanted to. Hed just rather have fun.  ",

        "article_text": "Until early this year, North Carolina emcee Phonte (Little Brother) and Dutch beatmaking sensation Nicolay had never met, or even spoke on the phone. Making their acquaintance on the webboards at Okayplayer, the two took The Postal Services album-by-correspondence technique to heart: Nicolay instant messaged beats to Phonte, who dropped verses, and then the Holland native mastered the product. The result, Connected, is a sweltering, improbable 14-track symphony teeming with potent lyricism and subtle, lustrous rhythmatics.\nIn todays hip-hop landscape, the organic and emotive qualities of classic soul are often bastardized (cf. Jagged Edge) but rarely duplicated. To wit: In its Hit Factory days, Motown churned out classics faster than Beanie Sigel garners arrest warrants. So either Nicolay is a musical genius who simply understands the language of classic R\u0026B; better than most stateside producers, or a Stax Records jetliner crashed in the Netherlands, spilling thousands of LPs on his thatched abode when he was a toe-tapping toddler.\n\"The Foreign Exchange Title Theme\" kicks Connected off with a syncopated harmony, while the welcoming voice of D.C.s YahZarah wafts, \"Thank you for the music, thank you for right now.\" That \"right now\" bit is telling, too, as the record revels in the glory of the moment: Urgent, immediate, instant gratification is one of Connecteds calling cards. \"Nics Groove\", for example, is equipped with sleepy brass, delicious harmonies and a booming bassline. Its like standing in the street during 5 minutes of the dopest house party you werent invited to-- and when you dare to peek in the window, Nicolay hits his apex on \"The Answer\", bowling the crowd over with an ephemeral thunder while Oddisee, Ken Starr, and Phonte rock the crowd, the latter claiming, \"I applied for the job of rap nigga, but I was overqualified.\"\nBut Connected is more than fluid construction and a unique backstory. Embedded in the layered vocal arrangements and popping rhythms are the seeds of a quiet rebellion. While crews like Mash Out Posse or Cocoa Brovaz may alienate newcomers with the furious intensity of their experiences, The Foreign Exchange delivers their triumphs and tragedies with silky surreptitiousness. Connected reads like the diary of the young, black hip-hop hopeful, as Phonte reminds us of the thousands of struggling MCs who sit in the shadow of The Source. He walks us through his money woes on \"Happiness\" (\"Writing mad checks that might as well have Spalding on them\"), his girlfriends pregnancy on \"Be Alright\" (\"My girl was throwing up this morning/ I pray it was something she ate\"), and his parents disapproval of his life on \"All That You Are\" (\"They cant understand how I feel when Im on the track board turning the knob switch/ My moms keep talking like get a real job shit\").\nDespite The Foreign Exchanges transatlantic relationship, the records stripped-down approach is reminiscent of the days when kids hijacked streetlamps to power their block party turntables. Amazingly, this album seamlessly flows without not only that street-level intimacy but without even the assistance of a shared studio. The result is enough to make the most heartbroken cynics fall in love with independent hip-hop all over again.",

        "article_text": "You wont find a tougher sell on neoclassicism than yours truly, so imagine my surprise how this strummy slab from the thrift racks has become one of my early 06 faves. Minneapolis-based Tapes n Tapes do it by the book-- thats to say, off the cuff, taking cues from indie legends and newies alike with star-pupil rigor, but never sweating the exam. Heres a charismatic, playfully slipshod band unconcerned with making all the loose ends meet up, audacious enough to leave the dot-connecting to us. But then, never quite knowing which Feelies riff or Malkmus vocal turn or, hell, CYHSY organ sound these guys will strike with next is precisely what makes The Loon such a rich, participatory, and eminently repeatable experience.\nTapes n Tapes kneel before Pavement, Wire, Beach Boys, and Pixies, bearing their influences more publically than notebook logo sketches. But facing the task of averting obviousness, they play the uncool card: \"The Iliad\" dresses its keystones in afro-MIDI percussion, cuica and humorously fake timbale, its garb recalling the shy kid in sculpture class who could be a hipster if not for those Sketchers: Are the kicks a defense mechanism, ironic one-upmanship, or just a really good deal at TJ Maxx? Its all part of their unpretentious approachability and charm. Tandem tracks \"In Houston\" and \"Manitoba\" lounge out with surprise vibe melodies, incongruously smooth counterpoints to an otherwise gruff sound. But the move doesnt raise eyebrows, instead fostering a mellow whiskey-belly warmth. Inconsistency, Tapes n Tapes understand, adds character and colorizes personality; it also keeps listeners off-balance and wanting more.\nIf their aesthetic choices sometimes bewilder, the vocals hit nearer mindfuck. Resistant to the emotionally soaring, soft-spot-as-high-point bone their forebears never hesitated to throw, Tapes n Tapes seethe smarm and snark. \"Ive been a better lover with your mother,\" frontman Josh Grier snarls over restless, incorrigible strums on \"Cowbell\". But while smack talks good for a snicker, the band choose introspection over in-joke on \"Insistor\", whose initially hushed, scat-quick vocals rise to meet the songs surging polka rhythm for a transcendent chorus: \"And when you rush Ill call your name like Harvard Square holds all inane.\" Delivered with just enough desperation to defeat its inscrutability, the lines sweet as Nutella from the jar, and probably healthier.\nUnknowable lyrics arent the only device Tapes n Tapes use to summon their primary influence (ahem, Pavement); the bands strict strums-over-riffs philosophy activates last-decade memories, too. \"10 Gallon Ascots\", alternately the albums softest and loudest cut, rides a furtive, sneaking rhythm that seems channelled straight from \"Stop Breathin\", while \"In Houston\" fuses its \"Two States\" two-beat stomp to the records most Malkmusian vocal articulation, an allusion so overt (and dead-on) it verges on memorial. But the band forgoes their heroes ascetic brevity-- theyre just too happy to wail, and too hyperactive to be stopped. \"Crazy Eights\" balloons from 90-second instrumental placeholder to something more complex after suddenly wormholing from casual swing to overdriven straight-time; \"Manitoba\" shakes off its blissful pre-dawn slumber to kick an ecstatic, vibraphone-free coda.\nWhile strong faith is always convincing, Tapes n Tapes succeed by practice as much as passion, articulating a conventional vocabulary with rare erudition. As such, The Loon brings something for everybody. Not that the bands diplomacy is a kowtow: Loving is just their quaint way of asking for love. Credit yourself if you can get down with a program offering up so many been-there-done-that indicators. Or better, credit the band for avoiding the toothless mush that typically results from this sort of populism, and arriving instead at a fresh vision through eloquent pastiche.\n ",

        "article_text": "When Carl Jung carved his symbols of mankind onto the face of his beloved cubic lawn jockey, among the archetypes of the collective unconscious present was surely the open hand. Part invitation and part warning, very few pictorial representations-- with the exception of the smile or frown-- are so readily recognized as the forward stare of the uncurled hand. With one glance at the album cover of The Sunburned Hand of the Mans latest release, Headdress, its apparent that the spirit of the deceased Swiss psychiatrist is alive and well in this musical collective hailing from the darkest recesses of Massachusetts.\nThe knit hand encircled by a background of stars embodies both the welcome and caution inherent in the music that is in turn violently cruel and unconformably beautiful. The fact that its a patchwork appendage, obviously tailor-made with minor imperfections magnified, displays the collective approach that more than likely went into the creation of the musical product itself. One imagines a procession line of long-haired bohemians printing and then hand-gluing album covers, inserting fresh-pressed vinyl into protective sleeves made from recycled rolling papers, then boxing and shipping the fresh goods away from the confines of an abandoned barn surrounded by three feet of mostly white snow.\nIts from this natural and mystical bond that the music emanates effortlessly. The opening track \"Shitless\" presents all of the musical motifs at the bands command upfront for aural inspection. A funky bassline and a smattering of odd percussion act as the soil and ground from which the guitars grow forth, as a recorder eventually pushes forward against a barrage of wails and grunts, more animal than human. \"Sense of the Senseless\" develops from this with a steady hypnotic drone cut intermittently by bird-chirps and struck bells. A polyphonic chant arises-- a modern Dies Irae-- as a whistle signals a tempo change that finds solace solely in the errant harmony of frantic shouting. The song ends with a lamenting cry to \"learn from experience,\" before fading far too quickly into the harmonica-driven track \"The Illness\".\nWith any luck, the band will heed their own plea, as the albums only true criticism can be that, at times, it sounds more like a collection of inspired moments that are cut far too short than a fully developed composition, more than likely a consequence of its finite medium. Brief windows of ingenuity such as the echo and din of the title track or the droning ebb and flow of \"A Second Guess\" would find more time to breathe, develop, and recapitulate given the format of a double album. As is, though, songs such as \"Yes, Your Highness\" dont have time to pick up the momentum of such Varèse-pleasing ideas as the use of sirens and strong complex rhythms incorporated into regular song structure.\nThis is not to say that the entire album feels abruptly halted or rushed, as \"The Underground Press\" proves contrary. Easily the most developed piece, if not the best, this is the swaying back and forth number on the album that allows the girl wearing the kitten ears at the live show to feel that shes comfortable enough with the crowd and herself to take off her shirt. Stravinsky himself would be proud of this unadulterated use of rhythm and beat, augmented by loud hypnotic chords pulsing from a variety of instruments, ultimately falling prey to the screams and whoops that herald its necessary finale.\nActing as a subtle trend in the album, the sense of prevalent necessity from song to song further merits one of the superior critiques that can be lauded upon a work of art, the discrimination of timelessness. This is not to say that the album could have been released at any given time with similar acclaim-- though it undoubtedly could have-- its only a comment upon how the music flows so readily with complete and utter disdain for trend and fashion that it feels simultaneously primitive and advanced, while retaining every bit of its musical relevance. In the end, the music leaves one with a sense of somber contentment and satisfaction as mysterious in origin as the warmth received from the open-hand greeting of a stranger.",

        "article_text": "Making honest art can be terrifying; with 2, Montreal-based Mac DeMarcos second release this year, it feels like hes jumping into the deep end. On DeMarcos other 2012 record, the EP Rock and Roll Night Club, he tinkered with yacht rock, AM radio gold, and Bowie-like glam. The mixture injected an unsettling sleaziness into a funny, occasionally creepy collection of songs that walked the line between irony and sincerity.\nIn contrast, 2 goes right for the gut. DeMarco writes about life-- both the heavy moments and the mundane ones-- with economy and newfound grace. Hes still not entirely upfront, but he has a knack for building songs where the realness of his subject matter lies just below the surface. In a Pitchfork guest list from earlier in October, DeMarco cites Jonathan Richman as a role model, mostly because he felt that Richman had \"a very enjoyable time his whole life.\" Richman is an expert at writing entire worlds into his songs, an approach that DeMarco nails on 2.\nOpening track \"Cooking Up Something Good\" is a strong example of his approach. A loose instrumental vamp slides into a greasy guitar line, as his laconic, sleepy voice delivers subtly heartbreaking observations. \"Mommys in the kitchen, cooking up something good/ And daddys on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood\". When the chorus comes in (\"Oh, when life moves this slowly/ Oh, just try and let it go\"), its blindsiding, and his sense of defeat is palpable.\nAs the song progresses it becomes clear that what initially felt like an ode to the frustrating teenage days of struggling against your suburban surroundings is actually about a father figure manufacturing drugs in the basement. \"Cooking Up Something Good\" is about boredom and sadness and our skewed perception of time, but its also about family secrets and how we construct emotional escape hatches to get away from the inescapable realities of blood ties. This careful world-building continues across the entire album, sometimes with a lighter touch. DeMarcos thinly veiled honesty shows up prominently on \"Ode to Viceroy\" where, over an unsettling guitar flange that fizzles into a flat shimmer, he sings about how much he loves smoking cigarettes. His voice skirts the edge of disinterest, but never quite gets there. \nAfter spending time with 2, DeMarcos vocal deadpan starts to sound weary and wise. On \"My Kind of Woman\", he effectively makes a prom love song that will never get played at any actual prom-- it oozes beautifully simple and direct sentiment: \"Youre my kind of woman/ And Im down on my hands and knees begging you please, baby, show me your world.\" That last line, \"show me your world,\" returns to the concept that DeMarco and the people he sings about are all living, breathing entities, not blank slates to project emotion on. When theyre gone from DeMarcos life, they still exist. It doesnt really get more honest than that.",

        "article_text": "Albums like Nonfiction, the first full-length from producer James Hinton (aka the Range), never get the credit they deserve: They’re too neat, too industrious, too polite—too many of the qualities we look for in coworkers and roommates and not enough of the ones we look for in artists. “I studied some math in school,” Hinton told us in a recent Rising interview. Math! Terrific. A sentence later he brings up his admiration for soft-rocker Bruce Hornsby. At 25, Hinton may have already blown the youth vote.\nNonfiction isn’t an album easily pegged to any scene or narrative currently circulating about electronic music. Its rhythms are rooted in hip-hop, drum \u0026 bass, and late-90s R\u0026B, rendered on the scale of someone making music more for home listening than club play. Even at its busiest, the album feels tidy and compact, like the gears of a prewar pocketwatch. (What’s interesting to me about Hinton’s syncopations—the jazzy, double-time blasts of hi-hat and snare drum—is that syncopation is usually used to make a straight beat sound momentarily off-balance, whereas on Nonfiction, the more syncopated the tracks are, the more orderly they feel.)\nNearly every track here is pretty, in the most conventional sense of the word. Soft pianos, fake strings, bass that stretches like taffy, and synth blips that twinkle like itsy bitsy stars—if the sounds on Nonfiction showed up on your doorstep in the dead of night, you’d probably let them in without question. On a lot of the album, Hinton’s approach reminds me of Aphex Twin circa Richard D. James tracks like “4” and “Girl/Boy Song”—songs that juxtapose a cute surface with a hard-hitting, even threatening undercurrent. The difference is that James is a perennial misfit who always seemed to be half-joking and Hinton operates with the earnestness of a post-rock band working in miniature.\nNonfictions highlights-- \"Metal Swing,\" \"Jamie\" and \"FM Myth\"-- are built around vocal samples. House and dance music have a long tradition of making the human voice do contortions on tape that they could never do live—a possibility afforded by samplers and digital recording, which enable producers to chop, cut, paste, and loop in ways that would’ve been agonizing in the analog era. On Nonfiction, Hinton allows his vocalists full phrases, sometimes even sentences. Usually, these vocalists are gruff-sounding English dudes who seem to have been wounded by something they aren’t ready to get too specific about. (Hinton says he mostly finds them on YouTube, a site that lets us glimpse into the lives of strangers in a way that feels both intimate and yet impossibly cryptic.) They repeat their laments, sometimes for minutes on end, while the music grows steadily around them. The result feels like a series of time-lapse portraits of people refusing to change despite their changing environment—a nice, melancholy touch on an album that tends to take extroverted music and turn it inward.\nEven if you listen to Nonfiction—and even if you like it—it probably won’t inspire you to call anyone up and say, “[Expletive], I just got back from the library, or the office, or picking up [friend’s name] at the airport, and I had this new Range album on at a reasonable volume the whole time, and it totally increased my general sense of well-being!” What it might inspire, though, is a kind of passive, slowly gestating admiration—the kind usually best measured in iTunes plays three or four months down the line, the kind you tend to recognize several hours into a workday in front of your computer, the kind that doesn’t surge like a fire but instead grows patiently, like a vine. ",

        "article_text": "For a few years now, the Decemberists stagey, hyperliterate folk-rock has played well at indie labels Hush and Kill Rock Stars. The quintet has occupied a small community-theater space with gleefulness and confidence, but now its accepted a scholarship to Capitol Records, which means a larger stage and a bigger audience. Can the band still project, or will its voices be lost in a cavernous auditorium, rejoined only by crickets and barely stifled coughs of boredom? Will nine-minute mariner epics play in Peoria?\nGiven the bands graduation from minor to major leagues, The Crane Wife may prove to be the most crucial record the Decemberists will release in their lifetime. Fortunately, their fourth album further magnifies and refines their strengths. Winsomely balancing frivolity and gravity, the Decemberists assemble an oddball menagerie of the usual rogues and rascals, soldiers and criminals, lovers and baby butchers-- but theyve got a lot more tricks up their sleeves than previous albums had hinted. The Crane Wife employs an impressive variety of styles and sounds to tell Meloys imaginative stories: Theres the bands usual folk-rock, honed to an incisively sharp point, but they also deploy a smugglers blues (\"The Perfect Crime\"), a creepy lullaby (\"Shankill Butchers\"), a Led Zep stomp (\"When the War Came\"), and, perhaps most divisively, a multipart prog track (\"The Island\") that stretches well past the 10-minute mark. No epic chantey this time, though.\nMeloys inventive songwriting is the binding force, emphasizing character but remaining ever in thrall to stories, savoring the way they always play out to the same conclusions. Along with the homosexual undertones that have informed Decemberists songs from every album, he jettisons most of the archetypes that inspired Picaresque and cuts his characters loose in their own tales. They still do what theyre fated to do-- the thieves thieve and run amok, the lovers love and die tragically, the soldiers soldier on and pine for peaceful homes-- but they seem to do it more out of free will than authorial design.\nMeloy focuses mainly on matters of war (\"But O did you see all the dead of Manassas/ All the bellies and the bones and the bile?\") and love (\"No, I lingered here with the blankets barren/ And my own belly big with child\"). On the duet \"Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)\", Meloy plays the part of an errant, possibly dead Civil War soldier while singer-songwriter Laura Veirs cameos as his \"sweetheart left behind.\" Its Cold Mountain writ poignantly small, its sweet, wordless chorus perfectly life-size. Lumbering menacingly, the martial march of \"When the War Came\" smells of gunpowder and singed hair, although it sounds like its anchored in Neverland despite trying to comment on real-world events.\nMeloys taletelling will always define the Decemberists, but The Crane Wife puts as much weight on the music as on the lyrics, and here the band gels into a tight, intuitive unit. The musicians give each song a particular spark and character, not just reinforcing the lyrics but actively telling a story. They create a breezy eddy of guitar strums and piano chords to enhance a windborne melody and an undercurrent of peril on \"Summersong\", and the tragedy of \"O Valencia\"-- any good song about star-crossed lovers must end in death-- is countered by the pep of the music, especially Chris Funks ascending and descending guitar, which seems to take a particular glee in the inevitable denouement. The band isnt just able-bodied, but ambitious to boot. It makes the brainy prog of that monster second track, a distillation of the musical reach of their 2003 EP The Tain, sound like a natural extension of their base sound. They troll confidently from the rumbling overture and heated exposition of \"Come and See\" to the final rueful notes of \"Youll Not Feel the Drowning\". The song is chockablock with progisms-- organ runs, dampered cymbals, laser synths-- but manages to shake off the genre quote marks as the band jam with convincing menace.\nTheir range allows them to be precociously diverse, but everything fits naturally. The Crane Wife sounds like their most shapely album to date, resembling a spirited story arc in its set-up, rising action, climax, and resolution. In this structure the three title segments, despite essentially bookending the tracklist, form the albums thematic centerpiece, the music and story meshing gracefully and tenderly to retell a Japanese fable. \"The Crane Wife 3\" opens the album with a ruminative flourish as John Moens drums push the sensuous thrust of the music and Meloys delivery of the lines \"each feather it fell from skin\" colors the resignation of \"I will hang my head hang my head low.\" It opens the album en medias res, setting up the subsequent story-songs as the narrators rueful reminiscences.\n\"The Crane Wife 1 and 2\" comprise a medley towards the albums end, starting slow and soft but gradually reaching crescendo in an unfurling finale, with Meloy breaking the word \"heart\" into multiple syllables over an unraveling drum beat. Restrained yet resonant, the songs (and albums) climax is a remarkable moment. As it segues into the rousing coda of \"Sons \u0026 Daughters\", the Decemberists sound like a band that knows exactly where theyre going and wont be satisfied until you come along for the trip.",

        "article_text": "MF Doom is an ever-evolving oddity. Since starting his career spouting bouncy, Brand Nubian-esque black power verses with his late brother Subroc and rapper Onyx in the collective KMD, Daniel Dumile has gained weight, smoked hallucinogens, drank libations, and developed a new style to match his rapidly deteriorating voice. Now, in a new arena of arrhythmia and soft beats, MF Doom staggers into a telephone booth somewhere underground and falls out as Viktor Vaughn.\nA joint project between Doom and Sound-Ink, Vaudeville Villains storyline follows the everyday life of super-villain/beat scientist/drug dealer/stick-up kid Vik Vaughn. Not surprisingly, it plays out much like any other Metal Face project: Dooms sick flow is tied to a fractured cadence, a slurry, guttural delivery, obscure pop culture references (\"Unfrozen caveman, look over the contracts\") and beautifully simple idioms and metaphors. Although best known for his more whimsical material, this album has Doom frequently coming off like Wu without the pretension, branching out into more evolved song structures (choruses!) and unusually focused topical and narrative tracks.\nThe pieces here run a larger gamut of topics than the shit-talking he mastered on Operation: Doomsday. Situations faced by our favorite masked rhymer this side of 93 Ghostface include the courtship of an underage girl (\"Let Me Watch\" with Apani B. Fly Emcee), a drug deal gone horribly awry (\"Lactose and Lecithin\"), an argument with a Chinese restaurant owner (\"Raedawn\") and the hilarious gunning down of a lame open mic night. While most underground emcees are content to rhyme about their intelligence, the evils of commercialism, and the general populaces lack of cognizance, Vik finds the perfect balance between complex songs and simple delivery, never hitting you with guilt trips or preaching to the choir.\nTheres no exaggeration made when you hear someone referring to Metal Face as one of the best writers in rap: \"Modern Day Mugging\" has Doom turning a tired theme like, well, robbing people from a ghetto cliché into a comedic spectacle, delivering a how-to for all aspiring thugs and thugettes: He only carries a .45 with \"no bullets, no clip\" that has \"black electrical tape over the hole in the handle\" but still manages to cause a fellow citizen to \"run his chain like an errand.\" After detailing clever break-in methods, he plays the fall guy, getting shot by one of his elderly victims and claiming that he \"woulda let her have it if he had the ammo.\"\nIn another example of Dumiles pen prowess, he teams up with former Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesayer M. Saayid for a cartoonish recollection of their education (\"Never Dead\"). Doom claims, \"If I dont study, Ima cheat off Peter Parker,\" and then teams up with schoolmate Saayid to run and gun on a search for Dooms stolen Donkey Kong game. Throughout the course of the song, they buy fireworks and indulge in Guyanese strippers in Chinatown, and Doom finds a guru who teaches him \"that the roach is never dead,\" hypothetically cultivating the future super scientist on which this album is based. Songwriting doesnt often come this lush, detail-minded or captivating in hip-hop these days, but its no surprise that the best songs in the genre are coming from an 80s transplant that claims to be \"a really big fan of Dan Aykroyd.\"\nAs expected on an album from one of the current greats, the soundscapes on Vaudeville Villain fail to keep pace with the classic lines being dropped left and right. This is Dooms first album consisting entirely of guest productions, and it quickly becomes apparent that he sounds better over his own work. Relatively unknown producers King Honey, Max Bill, and Heat Sensor offer a cohesive sound, but fail to really hit on a mood that suits Dooms drunken master assault. But there are moments where it all comes together brilliantly: Heat Sensors \"Raedawn\" is an electronic burner that writhes and lurches like a malfunctioning robot, stuttering out from of a pit of molten drums and sinister bells. King Honeys \"Let Me Watch\" is a pier-walking rock-skip across the ocean, equipped with a lumbering, Prince Paul-ish jazz loop and bassline. Rjd2 also drops by with the albums showstopper: \"Saliva\" delivers a triumphant string section, jubilant vocal sample, and bombastic horns across a subtle breakbeat backdrop.\nDespite its admittedly slight flaws, Vaudeville Villain goes head-to-head with Dooms other 2003 project, King Geedorahs Take Me to Your Leader, for what stands as the hip-hop album of the year thus far. Unless his collaboration with Madlib (MadVillain) or his official MF Doom LP on Rhymesayers prove to be flawless ventures, this album will come out not just among the years greatest, but also among the best in his catalog.",

        "article_text": "Every night in New York City, around 4,000 young people face the darkness without a home. Many are teens. A disproportionate amount are gay, lesbian, or transgender, shunned by their families or the world at large. Some close their eyes under trees in Central Park. Some sell sex downtown. Others go underground and lean their heads on the dulled metal of subway trains traveling along the ACE line, from the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Queens. According to \"Netherland\", a harrowing New Yorker story from last year that chronicled the citys young, homeless, LGBT underground, the ACE is known to some lodgers as \"Uncle Aces house.\" This comforting nickname provides the title and inspiration for \"Uncle Ace\", a key track from singer/songwriter/producer Devonté Hynes second album as Blood Orange. \nStarring the kind of battered-but-resilient souls who stroll through the city in the dead of night, the impressionistic song has Hynes switching between a low and high singing voice, subtly accentuating the androgynous characters within. Its mysterious, desperate, empathetic. \"Not like the other girls,\" he offers, possibly taking the purview of a woman who feels like a man, or vice versa. Hynes shines a careful light onto his vulnerable subjects, inhabiting their travails with grace, all while a disco pulse and smoky saxophones harken back to his beloved 80s, when Times Square was a misfits home away from home. The outcasts that live inside of \"Uncle Ace\" are Hynes people. As the London-raised, New York-based 27-year-old has hopped from project to project and style to style over the last 10 years, hes maintained the air of an outsider. With Cupid Deluxe, he channels those vagabond emotions into something universal and inviting—an album that tenderly details various heartaches through the language of longing. \nGrowing up, Hynes was bullied and beaten up enough to end up in the hospital on more than one occasion. He first directed his angst into Test Icicles spazzed punk as a teen before moving onto Morrissey-style tragic confessionals with Lightspeed Champion. His first album as Blood Orange, 2011s Coastal Grooves, traded in Lightspeeds orchestral folk-pop for slick new wave and funk, streamlining his once-unwieldy songwriting in the process. But it wasnt until he co-wrote and produced two songs from last year—Solanges \"Losing You\" and Sky Ferreiras \"Everything Is Embarrassing\"—that he found the most suitable vessel for his melancholic odes to expired love. Both tracks are propelled by springing 80s beats that are tugged down by minor chords and wounded lyrics; the upbeat drums suggest good times past, making the reality-check vocals hit that much harder. Given the blaring nature of modern pop, the subtlety of these hollowed-out songs was genuinely refreshing; not just \"indie\" for the sake of it, but affectingly human.  \nCupid Deluxe largely (and winningly) follows the formula set forth by those modest hits, while bringing them forth on a full-length scale. Across the album, Hynes sings, writes, produces, and plays guitar, bass, keyboards, drums, synths. But this is hardly a solo act. In fact, one of the records greatest strengths lies in its pitch-perfect deployment of guests. Not only does each member of the Cupid Deluxe team seem to fully understand the overarching wistfulness of the whole, but many of them show off heretofore unheard facets of their talent. While Hynes girlfriend and Friends frontwoman Samantha Urbani and Kindness leader Adam Bainbridge exhibited tentative skills with their respective groups debut albums last year, they make the most of their spotlights here; Urbani often sounds like shes mimicking the sultry chirpiness of an absent Solange, but her clear chemistry with Hynes makes the substitution more than adequate.\nMeanwhile, Dirty Projectors David Longstreth and Chairlifts Caroline Polachek have never sounded more soulful. Typically ominous rap producer Clams Casino contributes light, skittering drums to the Longstreth showcase \"No Right Thing\", which could fit snugly into any Vampire Weekend setlist. Even the sets two rap cameos, from Queens Despot and Londons Skepta, are anything but your usual in-and-out 16-bar guest shots—both MCs are given plenty of space to weave tales that are tactile and intimate, while Hynes vocals take on a more ghostly role on the tracks edges. And while the inclusion of a bubble-funk remake of Britpop curio Mansuns pompously overwrought 2000 single \"I Can Only Disappoint U\" sounds almost comically random on paper, Hynes Fat Boys scratches and Urbanis featherlight vocals make it fit into the albums loose after-hours milieu. Such awareness and selflessness consistently pays off, making all involved sound that much better.\nEspecially Hynes, whos in complete control. Each drum machine snap, snippet of errant barroom chatter, Malcolm McLaren sample, and moist-eyed, questioning chorus snaps together to form a midtempo mixtape for the high-school dance you never had. The first-blush glances. The slowed mirrorball twinkle. The push and pull. \"Baby are we on the line/ Tell me baby are you mine?\" he sings, knowing full well that if you have to ask the question, you probably know the answer.  \nLike many Manhattan iconoclasts before him, Hynes holds director Jennie Livingstons 1990 documentary of NYC gay and transgender ball culture, Paris Is Burning, very dear. While everyone from Madonna to Lady Gaga has taken inspiration from these events—one of the few safe havens for participants to revel in their true selves without having to worry about the judging eyes of society—they often focus on their more outrageous or empowering aspects (see: \"Vogue\"). But Dev Hynes music is more suited to the films beautiful and wrenching quiet moments, like when transgender model Octavia Saint Laurent confesses her desire to \"be somebody\" or is seen worshipping cut-outs of supermodels taped to the walls of her bedroom. The message comes full-circle on the Michael Jackson demo of a closing ballad, \"Time Will Tell\", which repurposes some of Hynes own lines while a refrain of \"and it keeps on running back\" underlines the repetition. Gay, straight, man, woman, black, white, or anywhere in between: Heartbreak is real. It wont stop.",

        "article_text": "Julian Lynch first hit our radar last year with a few promising tracks on the first Underwater Peoples compilation, followed by Orange You Glad, his debut release (and first non-CDR full-length) for the Brooklyn-based experimental label Olde English Spelling Bee. The record introduced us to his folksy collage-pop aesthetic, but while often beautiful, its low fidelity often felt more like a hindrance than a benefit, and the more traditional song structures could feel slight or meandering. His newest album, Mare, is another story. An earthy, eclectic record that manages to be challenging, but also remarkably patient, its the sound of the formerly Ridgewood, NJ-based songwriter quietly coming into his own.\nLynch once worked for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, and now studies ethnomusicology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and you can hear those diverse influences at work on Mare: The music is recorded on humble equipment, is rough around the edges, and pulls liberally from lots of different genres. There are traces of drone, noise, and African percussion, for instance, alongside more traditional pop and rock elements. His instrumentation is unusual and eclectic, incorporating clarinet, watery guitar lines, shuffling maracas, and delicate drum work. But where bedroom pop tends to be somber and even unsettling at times, Lynchs music is very much at ease with itself. And it sounds very organic. Tracks are experimental in composition but ultimately echo the mood of folk or country-- music that feels like it should be played outdoors.\nTheres a kicked-back, front-porch quality to the album-- songs are sedate and unfurl slowly. Lynch sings but obscures his vocals until they act as a loose guide rather than a specifc blueprint. So Mare is primarily about atmosphere, and in that sense its very much like an ambient record. And as with good ambient, it soothes without drifting off into the distance. This balance is key to the records success, and Lynch acheives it with a smart rhythmic touch. \"Interlude\" is airy and gentle but it has propulsion and direction. Under its woozy synths and indistinct vocal coos is a funky guitar line that keeps it moving forward.\nThe album is also sneakily complex. You can just let it wash over you-- and its good at that-- but the closer attention you pay, the more detail emerges. \"Ruth, My Sister\" is a pleasant wisp on first pass, but more spins show a dynamic arrangement that builds tension an inch at a time. And the sequencing is excellent: The record picks up steam around the seventh track, \"Ears\", which is bright and celebratory and just the right amount of spark so things dont become sleepy. Lynch is also smart to save some of his most straightforward material for the end of the record as a nice payoff. \"Travelers\" is probably the poppiest thing here-- just a simple vocal hook and melodic bassline-- but totally effective within the larger scheme.\nOne of the most likable things about Mare is that, for how druggy and narcotized it sounds, it doesnt comes across as sad or tuned-out. A lot of artists use these kinds of woozy textures to enhance a detached viewpoint, but ultimately this is colorful and engaged music. Its relaxed and inviting, and if the idea of summer music wasnt so generally overstated then Id say its also very season-appropriate. More centrally, though, its a major creative step forward for Lynch, whose absorbing ambient pop sounds prove how refreshing this kind of subtlety can be. Thats an easy sentiment to embrace.",

        "article_text": "Describing Emeralds music feels a little like capping that underwater oil spill must: how do you get your hands around this stuff? The Cleveland trio may favor methodical cadences in their music, but their releases come fast and furious. According to Discogs.com, theyve put out around 40 releases in just four years, most of them CDRs and cassettes. There are variations of mood and intensity, and each major release has its own particular signature, owing in part to changes in gear and technique, and in part to being a band that improvises and records non-stop. Any given album feels like a snapshot of the band in time.\nBut Does It Look Like Im Here? is the first Emeralds record you might be able to call \"pretty.\" Listeners accustomed to the multi-vectored force of last years What Happened, with its crush of competing swells, might initially be taken aback by the linear progressions here. Emeralds also finally seem to be playing actual notes, not just dialing in frequencies.\nThe songs are shorter-- aside from one seven-minute jam and a 12-minute blur, everything is around three or four minutes long. Thats partly because theyre dividing their music into smaller grids and speeding up the changes. On What Happened, tones rolled out in languid fashion. Thats still true here, but most of the albums tracks are built around arpeggiated backbones, bubbling sequences in 8th, 12th, or 16th note formations that focus the musics energy in a directed stream.\nIf what set Emeralds apart before was the fact that they sounded unlike almost anything else, here you can hear distinct echoes of other artists, whether its the burbling synthesizer music of 70s musicians like Edgar Froese and Klaus Schulze, or arpeggio-prone contemporaries like Oneohtrix Point Never, Jonas Reinhardt, or Gavin Russom. \"Double Helix\" finds a halfway ground between the gritty shuffle of early Kompakt and the Balearic drift of Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas. And \"Now You See Me\" is an honest-to-god waltz led by folky strummed guitar.\nBut theres something about Emeralds sound that really is theirs alone. (Timbrally, the band has never sounded richer-- thanks in part to James Plotkins mastering job-- and thats especially true of the luscious heavyweight vinyl pressing, cut at Berlins Dubplates \u0026 Mastering.) The way they set loops against loops, with super-fast pinwheeling oscillations buzzing out of control on top, turns their tracks into perpetual motion machines, gathering incredible force as layers accrue. Its a big part of the magic of this band, and what distinguishes even their most new age-flavored compositions: the overload of information, the spray of frequencies, the thrilling, viscous rush.",

        "article_text": "In \"My Home Is the Sea\", Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy, voice thin and impossibly brittle, conveys proud love for his bulbous tummy, gleefully declaring it \"round and firm and funny\"-- just like him! Sardonic or not, this kind of belly-speak marks a rare moment of self-revelation for Will Oldham, who skewers accepted notions of static identity nearly every time he lowers his big, bearded jaw. Still, Oldham (appearing here as contemporary alter-ego Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy) is, ultimately, exactly what he says he is-- smart and tough and weird, an awkward, oddly charismatic songwriter just as well-suited to coughing up death-ballads as he is to giggling out ditties about his penis. Witness, again, the bitter joy of loyal Oldham-hood: He is simultaneously quiet and loud, both crushing and absurd, and filed in seven different places at the record store.\nSuperwolf, a new collaboration with guitar freelancer Matt Sweeney, sees Oldham at his squirrely best, squeaking out his finest songs since 1999s I See a Darkness. Superwolf marks Oldhams first official partnership with Sweeney, whose credits include a predictably brief stint axe-grinding in Billy Corgans Zwan (alongside longtime Oldham buddy and Slint-forefather Dave Pajo), occasionally playing guitar in Guided by Voices, and fronting the long-departed Chavez (who released two revered full-lengths on Matador in the mid-90s).\nSweeneys participation in Superwolf was supposedly a response to a songwriting \"challenge\" from Oldham, and in addition to songwriting, Sweeney contributes backing vocals and guitar figures that echo Oldhams own blows, sometimes with eerie accuracy. But despite all that buddying up, Superwolf is still at times unnervingly spare-- Oldham and Sweeneys pauses can be devastating, and some of Superwolfs most powerfully convincing bits pop up between notes.\nOpener \"My Home Is the Sea\" may sound an awful lot like late Grateful Dead (or, perhaps more specifically, like a slightly less raucous version of brother Ned Oldhams Anomoanon, who regularly employ Garcia-brand noodling and wild, space-rock somersaults), but most of Superwolf is quiet and intensely meditative, despite Sweeneys significant rock-inflections. Still, Oldham has always had a funny habit of inserting perverse, quasi-sexual shouts into otherwise-staid songs (see brutally confessional couplets rubbing up against phrases like \"my horny horn\"), and at least thematically, Superwolfs eleven tracks are predictably shifty-- \"My Home Is the Sea\" is rife with snarky lyric tricks (watch Oldham follow the momentarily devastating \"I have often said/ That I would like to be dead\" with a tiny pause and silent giggle, finally finishing with: \"In a sharks mouth\").\nNo matter who or what he calls himself, Will Oldham has always been uniquely capable of making colossal leaps in tone between breaths, and from track to track Superwolf nobly maintains that practice, drifting gracefully from classic-rock stomps to whispery dirges. Consequently, Oldham followers may recognize Superwolf as a welcome midway point between Oldhams past aliases, as it hops from shambling, Viva Last Blues-ish, Palace Music-era shakes to dark, Master and Everyone haunts. \"Beast for Thee\" matches a gorgeous, barely-there melody with self-deflating lyrics (\"Why are you kind to me?/ You could so easily take me in your arms and see/ A donkey\"), Oldhams quivering pipes and Sweeneys fragile guitar coalescing into a soft, droning, and tremendously pretty whole. The equally excellent \"Blood Embrace\" features some of Oldhams heartiest vocals, each word strong and full, floating above dark electric guitar swirls, dodging film samples of a faithless woman whispering to an unnamed lover, crafting an atmosphere so tense and ominous that you almost cant help twisting your face around to peep over your shoulder.\nSoft and subtle, Superwolf is the kind of record that unwinds slowly, and is best enjoyed over multiple listens and, unsurprisingly, many glasses of wine. Oldham and Sweeney mew coquettishly, stroking their guitars, cawing bizarre stories about love, death, and body parts: theirs is a rancid and beautiful landscape.\n ",

        "article_text": "Those of you who keep abreast of online rumor-mongering might be surprised to find that the rating at the top of this page is a few points shy of a 10.0. No sooner had Destroyers Rubies leaked to internet file-trading services than rumors (credited, as these things always are, to \"reliable sources\") began to spread that the album was to receive a perfect score from this publication. It wasnt until I actually sat down and gave Destroyers Rubies a few good listens that the aptness of such a rumor really hit me: The album is structurally complex, thematically dense, and labyrinthine in its self-referentiality. Dan Bejars vocals are, like many of his indie contemporaries, yelpy and dramatic, and many of his lyrics seem preordained to serve as mp3 blog headers. In other words, the qualities that once made Destroyer albums so \"difficult\" make Destroyers Rubies a perfect record for this critical moment.\nWriting about Destroyer has proven to be, to borrow a quote from Bejar himself, \"a playground for fun.\" Destroyer reviews have an unfortunate tendency to read like essays written for college seminars. Bejars writing seems to lend itself particularly well to analysis as a \"text,\" often resulting in reviews that focus exclusively on the referentiality of his lyrics. But, while listening to Destroyers Rubies, I think many writers-- myself included-- have been missing the point. At its core, Destroyer is an almost unfashionably conventional (or, as Bejar would say, \"classical\") project. Bejar writes well-crafted pop/rock songs that, for all their lyrical complexity, tend to be about people (usually girls) and places he knows. The obtuse character of Bejars lyrics strikes me not as a Waste Land-esque shot at epic intertextuality, but rather a simple refusal to write things that will make sense to everybody. If more singer/songwriters wrote lyrics without stopping to explain every single reference, or reducing their thoughts to poetic-sounding generalities, Bejars lyrics might not seem so impenetrable.\nYet, while some have been busy puzzling out every reference in every Destroyer song, Bejar has been quietly and consistently honing his craft, putting out albums that are uniformly strong but thoroughly unique in their musical sensibilities. Though 2001s Streethawk: A Seduction stands as his most concise and catchy record, 2002s much-maligned This Night was a triumph in its own right. With more-reverb-than-guitar guitars, more-fill-than-drumbeat drumbeats, and choruses that mostly consisted of \"ba ba ba\" or \"la la la,\" Bejar recast musical excess as the core and foundation of a surprisingly solid rock album. With 2004s Your Blues, he dabbled in flamboyantly theatrical vocals and canned MIDI instruments, committing two of the very few aesthetic crimes that might have effectively dismantled the substantial buzz that was building around Destroyer.\nWhich brings us to Destroyers Rubies, Bejars seventh, and best, full-length as Destroyer. The albums nearly 10-minute self-titled opening track makes clear that whatever Bejar may have lost in terms of precision he has made up in versatility. Structurally, \"Rubies\" is remarkably sophisticated, cycling through several mini-verses but never congealing into any standard song form. Built around a few simple themes, \"Rubies\" covers a great deal of ground both musically and emotionally as Bejars characteristically serpentine melody carries him through careening guitar hooks, military snare drum fills, and a strikingly spare acoustic guitar finale. The endlessly catchy \"Painter in Your Pocket\" opens with a similarly stark acoustic guitar intro, then unexpectedly builds up more bounce and swing than any Destroyer song to date. By the time the song reaches its final chorus, it has attained a blissful, sing-songy energy that hasnt really graced any Destroyer record since Streethawk.\nThe success of epic songs like \"Rubies\" and \"Painter in Your Pocket\" owes a great deal to Bejars development as a singer. While Streethawk is considered by most fans to be the best Destroyer record, Bejars vocal performance seems stifled and flat in comparison to Destroyers Rubies. On Your Blues, Bejars substantial growth as a vocalist was more or less entirely obscured by the records synthetic accompaniment. But over the course of Destroyers Rubies, Bejar coos, hisses, and snarls with uncharacteristic confidence. Hes always had a knack for unique phrasing in his melodies, and his newfound expressive range greatly enhances their impact.\nUnfortunately, the album does falter a bit toward its end. \"A Dangerous Woman Up to a Point\" substantially outstays its welcome, ultimately coming across like a half-assed rehash of \"Looters Follies\". \"Priests Knees\" is sorely lacking in melody, and probably could have been omitted altogether. The albums closing track, \"Sick Priest Learns to Last Forever\", pushes the bar-band-from-hell aesthetic a bit too far, and winds up living up to its name in a rather unflattering manner. Given the generally high quality of the songs on Destroyers Rubies, these bouts of sloppiness come off as particularly frustrating. But while Destroyers Rubies is by no means a flawless record, its most glaring flaws are for the most part mercifully self-contained. Encapsulating and elevating the best of Destroyers back catalog, Destroyers Rubies serves as a potent reminder that the intelligence of Bejars songs has never obfuscated their emotional weight.",

        "article_text": "Male Bondings songs are fast, noisy, and full of hooks, a combination that might remind you of any number of things: Nirvana-era fuzz-pedal stompers, 1990s American indie rockers, Hüsker Dü and Dinosaur Jr. followers, not-quite-shoegazer English bands. Like a lot of those acts-- and like their contemporaries in No Age and Abe Vigoda-- Male Bonding started out making more abrasive music. Two of the three members used to be in the noise-pop band PRE, and the rich London scene theyre coming out of-- a loose collective of bands with more of a common spirit than a common sound-- is full of scratchy post-punk, lo-fi fuzz, and hints of classic labels like Teenbeat, K, and Flying Nun. These are the kinds of foundational sounds that indie rock often turns back to when it needs to clear its head. But with Male Bonding, part of the treat is hearing them jump out of that and find room in the wide-open field where amped-up, rangy punk stuff collides with tuneful slacker pop. (Early on, they covered both Black Flag and Blur.) No surprise that theyve wound up signed to Sub Pop, a label that built part of its reputation on that sound.\n\"That sound\" isnt new, of course. It helps that Male Bonding are shockingly good at it, and remarkably efficient. The songs on Nothing Hurts are short, direct, pared down to essentials, and tightly packed-- with hooks, with changes, with instrumental fireworks. They move rapidly from zoomy rock to more atmospheric breaks (\"Franklin\"), and from a terrific run of loose, spiky gems in the middle (\"Crooked Scene\", \"Weird Feelings\") to some surprises toward the end. (The closer, a scratchy acoustic number, features guest vocals by Vivian Girls.) Frontman John Arthur Webbs vocals and lyrics can be a little hazy and non-committal-- often thats part of the charm-- but theyre not really in the spotlight. Listening to tracks like \"T.U.F.F.\" and \"Pumpkin\", you get the sense that this bands songwriting starts from the way their instruments lock together when theyre playing in a room-- cymbal-bashing drum parts, chunky bass lines, and Webbs shattered-sounding guitar leads-- leaving this record as a fuzzy, no-nonsense, half-hour document of what they do.\nAnd then there are the hooks. The hustle, the energy, and the sheer number of them make this an easy album to love-- especially if youre in the mood for some feedback, Nirvana moves, and punk-rock energy along with your melodies. One of the best comes during the killer chorus of a slack pop song called \"Nothing Remains\", which runs back and forth between a punk-rock build and a burst of high, cooing backing vocals; its loose, noisy, and wonderfully graceful. Nothing Hurts is full of that kind of excitement: the sound of a fast, fuzzy rock band racing from hook to hook, plowing happily through breakdowns and guitar blasts, springing through scrappy melodies with style. Its one of the happiest surprises of the year so far.",

        "article_text": "Directed by French New Wave great Éric Rohmer, 1972s Chloe in the Afternoon tells of a man caught between fidelity and a stylish old friend named Chloe, who usually pops up at his office after lunch. But just when it looks like the two are going to consummate their affair, the husband is struck with a crisis of conscience and runs back home to his wife. The opening track on Annie Clarks third album as St. Vincent is also called \"Chloe in the Afternoon\", and while Clark has acknowledged the influence of Rohmers film on the song, she takes the story to a darker, more dominatrix-y place. In her telling, Chloe carries a \"black lacquered horse-hair whip,\" and, presumably, is paid to use it on white-collar exhibitionists looking for a sadistic tea-time fix. Clarks monstrously corroded guitar riff stands in for the bruised skin and wincing faces; its hard to tell if shes singing as the person wearing heels or the person being stepped on with them, and thats most definitely the point.\nAcross three albums, the Dallas native has become a master of subverting her picture-perfectness with violence, rage, and mystery-- \"Ill make you sorry,\" sang Clark in creepy lullaby tones on the very first song on her debut album. The juxtaposition is naturally intriguing, a sophisticated twist on finding out that the horror-movie killer was actually the girl next door all along. \"Physically, Im a very demure-looking person,\" Clark said in a recent Pitchfork interview, \"but I certainly have as much aggression or anger as the next person, and thats got to come out somehow.\" On her fine, art-rocking debut, Marry Me, those feelings of hurt, loss, and bloodlust could translate a tad cutesy. (On new track \"Cheerleader\", the lines, \"Ive played dumb when I knew better/ Tried too hard just to be clever,\" sound more self-consciously frank than usual.) Follow-up Actor found Clark over-embellishing at times, adding superfluous strings and flutes that often muddied her message.\nBut Clarks recent live Big Black covers saw her taking the pretty/ugly contrast to raw new levels: \"I think I fucked your girlfriend once, maybe twice,\" she sang, fervently, on \"Bad Penny\", \"I fucked all your friends girlfriends-- now they hate you!\" And anyone whos seen the Berklee dropout do her seizured duckwalk in concert while soloing on unhinged tracks like \"Your Lips Are Red\" knows her not-so-secret weapon is a lurching guitar style somewhere between Robert Fripps sheet-metal prog and Tom Morellos 10-ton riffage. On Strange Mercy, she ditches Marry Mes naivety and Actors ostentatious arrangements, boosts the inventive guitar playing, and ends up with her most potent and cathartic release yet.\nSome tracks build like a hot kettle, puffing out ragged smoke in the form of instrumental curlicues. \"Surgeon\" finds Clark zonked, despondent, paralyzed. \"Turn off the TV, wade in bed, a blue and a red, a little something to get along,\" she sings, \"best, finest surgeon, come cut me open.\" And soon enough, the song revives itself with a bursting synth freak-out courtesy of gospel keyboardist Bobby Sparks. \"Cheerleader\" breaks on its enormous hook, with Clark singing, \"I, I, I, I, I dont wanna be a cheerleader no more,\" each \"I\" pounding down hard, emphatically stating its independence. And its Clarks manic guitar-- sounding like exploding radio static-- that cuts through a relationships indecisive fickleness on \"Northern Lights\". On that song, she sings, \"Gotta get young fast gotta get young quick/ Gotta make this last if it makes me sick,\" and the topic of aging and lost youth is brought up several times on the album.\nAt 28, Clark seems to be sorting through her own existential artistic dilemmas. A champagne year is supposed to be celebrated when you turn the same age as the day you were born, but \"Champagne Year\" finds the singer-- born September 28, 1982-- in a decidedly non-bottle-popping mood. Her voice takes on a gorgeous creak on the nebulous ballad, as she sings, \"I make a living telling people what they wanna hear/ Its not a killing but its enough to keep the cobwebs clear.\" An almost-30 indie musicians lament? Perhaps. Meanwhile, the galloping \"Hysterical Strength\" employs some magical thinking while dealing with death. When Clark isnt bulldozing through time and space with her fretwork, shes contemplating her place with care. The balance is something to behold.\nWhile Strange Mercys more propulsive workouts-- including the single \"Cruel\", Clarks purest pop song to date-- are quick to snag attention, the slow burners hit just as heavily. The playful \"Dilettante\" combines the mutant funk of David Bowies \"Fashion\" with the understated genius of DAngelos Voodoo, and has Clark possibly propositioning a prophet: \"Oh, Elijah, dont make me wait/ What is so pressing that you cant undress me, anyway?\" Closer \"Year of the Tiger\" is a stark summation of end-times capitalism in a recession-stuck United States. Sounding like a Wall Street swindler, she slithers, \"Italian shoes like these rubes know the difference/ Suitcase of cash in the back of my stick-shift... Oh America, can I owe you one?\" And the delicate title track involves a child, a father stuck behind prison glass, and a breaking point in the form of a refrain: \"If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up, no I dont know what.\" Her threat here is not a gimmick or a subversion; its irrational, confused, and real.\nSpecific names (Chloe, Elijah) and times (\"Year of the Tiger\", \"Champagne Year\") give the sense that Strange Mercy exists in its own universe. As does its music, which skips through art-rock touchstones from Talking Heads to Kate Bush to Peter Gabriel without relinquishing a bit of its originality. After all, those artists were trying to create new sounds, an ever-more-difficult task in a culture steeped in its own detritus. Here, Clarks role-playing is grounded in emotions that are as cryptic as they are genuine and affecting. And when her voice cant bear it, her guitar does the screaming.",

        "article_text": "In a 2009 Show No Mercy interview with Olympia \"astral black metal\" band Wolves in the Throne Room, I mentioned that, as a byproduct of their relative success outside of the underground, theyd inevitably be on the receiving end of plenty of scenester backlash. (Black metal can be a strange place: at times, its more acceptable to remain boring and unknown than be ambitious and heard.) A couple of years later, United States black metal in general is at an interesting point. The scene, or lack thereof, is something Ive been going on about for the last few years; now, on the backs of crossover \"experimental black metal\" acts like Krallice and Liturgy, its nudging into even more mainstream corners. And this time, theres more at stake than the ire of a 16-year-old Darkthrone fan.\nSure, there are longtime USBM diehards like Inquisition, Absu, and Averse Sefira, groups whove been there for decades, and who will keep releasing strong albums without showing up on your non-metal friends iPod. That said, even three years ago, nobody wouldve expected Liturgy to share the stage with Dirty Projectors at a New Yorker festival. (Or, earlier this year, to play MoMA on their own merits, and not as part of a Banks Violette black metal-themed installation.) There will always be an underground, but these days, once you are outside of it, the opportunities are bigger. More important than scene cred and these crossovers, though, is the fact that American black-metal bands-- no longer the punchline of Scandinavian lifers-- are making truly staggering music.\nWolves in the Throne Room sit somewhere between the crossovers and the kvlt. Since forming in 2004, brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver (and the occasional rotating bandmate) have tied early-90s Northern European sounds (especially Burzum and Ulver) and the progressive reach of San Francisco forebears Weakling to the Pacific Northwest, pushing the genre into new places without sacrificing its core. (Outspoken environmentalists, they live on a self-sufficient farm in Washington state.) To the chagrin of many of the bands later fans, they followed their biggest moment, 2007s Two Hunters, with 2009s Black Cascade, a collection of less-penetrable, 10-plus minute, stripped back, droning, unrelenting time-stretchers. Despite the running time, it was a pure, concise collection-- the sound that remains after the last log turns to ash in your campfire. Celestial Lineage, on the other hand, gains power via accumulation. (Press materials reference Popul Vuh, the Grateful Dead, Neurosis, and \"Theosophists, beatniks… the back-to-the-land movement, satanic hippies, tree-spiking anarchist punks.\") It takes the blisteringly insistent, gorgeously rousing, hypnotic repetitions on Black Cascade and jams them back into the more sylvan earlier records, 2006s Diadem of 12 Stars and the aforementioned Two Hunters.\nWhere the past two albums each had four songs of longer duration, Celestial gives us seven, spacing out the mammoths with briefer interludes. Vocalist Jessika Kenney, who first surfaced on Two Hunters and has also worked with Sunn O))), Sun City Girls, Asva, and Mamiffer, sings on three tracks. Former Isis howler (and current Mamiffer member) Aaron Turner contributes atmospheric chanting of the two-minute \"Permanent Changes in Consciousness\". \"Rainbow Illness\" introduces noisy synth washes, and the dramatic, goth-liturgical chimes of the female-fronted, six-minute \"Woodland Cathedral\", feels like a continuation of Two Hunters \"Dea Artio\".\nIt probably is. Wolves in the Throne Room consider Celestial Lineage the last installment in a trilogy that started with Two Hunters, and perhaps their last album as a band (at least in its current form)-- this is the climactic, colossal finale. In that regard, the epic, more metallic outpourings are the best theyve done. Weve posted the ethereal, harsh, 12-minute opener \"Thuja Magus Imperium\", with its psychedelic guitar freakouts, chiming bells, female choirs, field recordings, endless guitar/synth sustain, buzzing shoegaze, and monster dynamics. The seven-minute \"Subterranean Initiation\", in turn, spirals into infinity, layering in keyboards that come off like a celestial choir amid the frantic drums and levitating guitars. They locate a harsher, more earthly feel on \"Astral Blood\", a song with an anthemic, post-punk vibe that surfaces after a windy, gently pastoral acoustic interlude. The 11-minute closing track, \"Prayer of Transformation\", works as a synth-entwinted instrumental for 5 minutes before Weaver screams: \"Lay your corpse upon a nest of oak leaves/ Wrapped in a star shroud repent your flesh/ A shadow child dissolves/ Meditate in a den of skins and straight poles... A vessel awaits built from owl feathers and moss,\" among other things. Its rare for a black-metal song to choke you up.\nDespite being relative latecomers to the game, and even though theyre fucking with the template more than purists would like, Celestial Lineage feels like the contemporary American scenes defining statement after San Francisco group Weaklings seminal 2000 offering Dead As Dreams. Since their early days, Wolves have grown assured, but havent overstepped. The sound is enormous, but remains organic (at times, you can almost hear leaves rustling). Its true black metal creating its own rules, and a testament to the band that it can tweak something this much and still sound like its sticking to the script. That said, though its not the purest version, its also not the most eccentric. In some ways Celestial feels like a throwback when compared to the claustrophobic experimentation of some of Leviathans headier pieces or the genre-shifting hyper-speed \"occult metal\" of contemporary Absu. Thing is, though, unlike a lot of that other stuff, it also feels like a classic.",

        "article_text": "On \"Mushaboom\", the signature track from her 2004 breakthrough album Let It Die, Leslie Feist claimed, \"It may be years until the day my dreams will match up with my pay.\" Now, after countless sold-out shows across the world, close to half of a million records sold, and placement in a commercial for British bed manufacturers Silentnight, it seems safe to say this NPR darlings \"pay\" should be satisfactory. But, while Feist may now be able to afford the idyllic hideaway she pined for in \"Mushaboom\", the Calgary native still wouldnt be able to enjoy its creature comforts thanks to her hectic, frequent-flyer schedule. Alas: Faraway, so close. Brimming with heartbreak, solitude, and foggy memories, Feists \"dreams\" still sound distant on The Reminder, the singers outstanding third album.\nMostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration from the disconnections of non-stop, intercontinental hotel-jumping. Talking about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know youre not going to have much more than that.\" Though shes trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the 31-year-old songwriter sounds desperate for something more than \"simple conversation\" here.\nUnlike the half-covers/half-original split of Let It Die, every song but one was at least co-written by Feist on The Reminder. (And her buzzing take on the traditional playground sing-along \"Sea Lion Woman\" makes it distinctively Feist-ian anyway.) Whereas her last albums smoothed-out eclecticism could be both daunting and empty, The Reminder is equally diverse yet more full-blooded. From the indie pop of \"I Feel It All\" to the creeping electro-ballad \"Honey Honey\", the album ambles effortlessly; its musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to offer an intense cohesiveness. The records keen combination of off-the-cuff production and no-fat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist-- aided by her usual one-named conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and others-- recorded them in less than a week in a manor outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiels, makeshift choirs, and other subtle accoutrements never announce themselves ostentatiously. Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current singer-songwriter trends that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the basics-- melody, arrangement, feeling.\nHardly the first singer-songwriter to love, live, lose, and emote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diary-keeping tunesmiths with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney weep. Marked by specks of Dusty Springfields soul, Björks confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchells warmth, the singular allure of Feists vocals is difficult to deny or overstate. You might hear her over cappuccino-machine hisses in Starbucks, but her direct-line moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on The Reminder, her whisper-to-wail control-- exemplified by stark heart-tuggers \"The Water\" and \"Intuition\"-- is even more striking than before.\n\"With sadness so real that it populates the city and leaves you homeless again,\" coos Feist on \"The Park\", a desolate, lovelorn lament. The song-- with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feists sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of The Reminders wounded pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes \"Intuition\" with a question, \"Did I miss out on you?\"-- its insolubility packing more ache than a hundred clear-cut break-up songs. Such eternally spotty \"what if?\" queries neednt always strike such dour chords. On the shaggy, Broken Social Scene-esque romp \"Past to Present\", the refrain (\"Theres so much past inside my present\") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud vitality. But no matter where she sits on loves teeter-totter-- down on the after-the-fact apology of \"Im Sorry\" or aloft in heady infatuation on \"Brandy Alexander\"-- her philosophy-of-self is sound.\nAfter inconclusively rifling though her personal history for 12 songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence on finale \"How My Heart Behaves\": \"Im a stem now...fanning my yellow eye,\" she sings over wafting piano and harp. Though the song reads like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a query: \"What grew and inside who?\" What shes referring to isnt exactly clear-- and thats the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within half-realized dreams and faces? Timeless.",

        "article_text": "Sharing its title with a John Kennedy Toole novel, the Arcade Fires second album is markedly different from its more cloistered predecessor: On Neon Bible, the band looks outward instead of inward, their concerns more worldly than familial, and their sound more malevolent than cathartic. Angry, embittered, and paranoid, but often generously empathetic in their points of view, they target the government, the church, the military, the entertainment industry, and even the basest instincts of the common man.\nWhile the groups us-against-the-world stance occasionally comes off as slightly self-righteous or reactionary, their scathingly critical perspective gives weight and direction to their nervy earnestness: If Funeral captured the enormity of personal pain, Neon Bible sounds large enough to take on the whole world. This is evident on the albums incantatory opener, \"Black Mirror\", whose title derives from a centuries-old device that supposedly foretold future events and allowed viewers supernatural insight the hearts of men. Here, the band holds that mirror up to the world and captures a malevolent reflection.\nFitting Neon Bibles more worldly concerns, the Arcade Fire have streamlined the raw, large sound of Funeral into something that achieves the same magnitudinous scale through more economical means. Propelled by inventive guitar work and Jeremy Garas steady drums, the group pares back anything that might curb the controlled forward thrust of songs like \"Black Mirror\", \"Keep the Car Running\", or \"The Well and the Lighthouse\". These songs dont erupt, but gradually crescendo and intensify. Unlike the cathartic Funeral, Neon Bible operates on spring-loaded tension and measured release. As such, it could strike some listeners as a disappointing follow-up, but the records mix of newfound discipline and passion will likely imbue it with a long shelf-life.\nOn most songs, the Arcade Fire achieve a headlong forward motion, bolstered by immense church organs and Calexico horns that underscore the angst of Butlers bitter, accusatory lyrics. Perhaps the most noticeable (and promising) development in the bands sound is the more prominent role of Régine Chassagne. If she once sounded studied or mannered, here her angelic soprano projects a tentative hopefulness, making her a capable foil for Win Butlers tense performance. Her contributions to \"(Antichrist Television Blues)\" and \"Black Wave\" sound like the vocal equivalent of her soaring string arrangements, co-written with Owen Pallet of Final Fantasy.\nThese changes arent drastic, but they are significant, especially as they reveal new and interesting touchstones for the bands aesthetic. The influences most commonly associated with Funeral were Davids Byrne and Bowie, but on Neon Bible, its Bruce Springsteen who appears not only in the wordy songs and aggressive shuffle, but in the compression of so many styles and sounds into one messy, exciting burst. \"Ocean of Noise\" shuffles furtively on a shoreline samba, due largely to Tim Kingsburys bassline, while \"Bad Vibrations\", sung by Chassagne, blends girl-group and new wave performances into a darkly enticing whole. The band never compartmentalizes these styles or consigns them to separate songs, but allows them to blend freely.\nAlthough theyve expanded their sound, the Arcade Fires transition into extroversion isnt always smooth or graceful. Neon Bible is full of clunky lyrics, revealing Butlers tendency to overstate and sensationalize. His rhyme schemes are sometimes too deliberate and set-- and no one should be allowed to use the sort of faux-antiquated sentence construction that pops up in lines like \"I fell into the water black.\" \"Black Mirror\" features one of the records worst offenders: \"Mirror mirror on the wall/ Show me where them bombs will fall.\" Butlers words, however, have always carried less meaning than the way he sings them and the sound in which his band envelops them, so whenever a line falls flat on Neon Bible, the music, always hurtling forward, picks it up and carries it along.\nLike many indie artists, the Arcade Fire work best in the album format, and Neon Bible runs on a different-- and in some ways more finely tuned-- mechanical system than its predecessor. Its a shapely work, gracefully building to fall away to build again, as the band sustains a mood thats both ominous and exhilarating. Even \"No Cars Go\", which originally appeared on their self-titled debut EP, sounds more powerful here than it did in its previous incarnation. As stand-alone tracks, these songs dont make as much sense, which partly explains why those early leaks were so uninspiring. The danger here is inaccessibility: Theres only one natural entry point to Neon Bible, and its \"Black Mirror\". Everything afterwards flows seamlessly from that songs low rumble and startling imagery-- until the final track.\nVenturing into the lyrical realm of Trent Reznor, album closer \"My Body Is a Cage\" seems too eager to wallow in the sort of pained melodrama that fuels the bands detractors. The real disappointment is that Neon Bible doesnt end with \"No Cars Go\", which easily achieves the release they artfully promise but playfully deny throughout the records first nine tracks. Not only would it have ended the album on a more generous note, it would have made perfect thematic sense as a final invitation to escape.\nBut despite their conflictedness , the Arcade Fire remain firmly rooted in the here and now. And even as press coverage and fan obsession suggest that the world is making a place for them, the band is still looking for a way to understand that world, and to see it for what it really is-- or at least as it appears in the distorted mirror they hold to it.",

        "article_text": "Patrick Wolf is growing up. The classically trained, left-of-center indie stars colorful adolescence and early twenties were unusually productive, resulting in two charming albums (2003s Lycanthropy and 2005s Wind in the Wires) that found delicate string-and-piano pop pieces laced with guttural electronics. Both were charismatic but maudlin efforts, full of bittersweet montages, percussion-heavy compositions, and pissy, spit-out vocals that documented search after fruitless search for enlightenment or joy-- but if it all seemed a bit self-absorbed, there was no denying Wolf had a way with a melody.\nWith The Magic Position, though, Wolf shakes off much of the brooding insularity that clouded his previous records, refining his melodic strengths and overcoming his tendency toward sullen introspection. Album opener \"Overture\" has an energetic, marching pulse, its ascending violin line providing a lilting and confident backbone as Wolf announces his newly discovered positivity. Hes \"found the major key,\" as he states in the title cut, and its in that key that Wolf affirms his growth not just as a songwriter, but as an entertainer. Where Wind in the Wires musical potency was sometimes overshadowed by Wolfs penchant for melodrama, The Magic Position takes cues from Kate Bush, Antony, and Current 93 (and, okay, sometimes just a little Adam Ant) to turn his natural theatricality into an asset: Here, its used to lend a sense of ethereal drama, to set scenes, tell stories, and imbue the record with a sort of campy, reverent mysticism.\nBut what still stands out most is the songs themselves: These tracks-- especially the upbeat springtime romp \"Get Lost\", the danceable, triumphant \"Accident and Emergency\", and the celebratory title track-- show an entirely new side of Wolf: one that finally puts impeccable pop songcraft ahead of lachrymose keening. The title track, in particular, is a stunner, riding a cantering violin riff to a soaring, staccato pop anthem. The keyboards playful, ascending scale acts as a cheerful motif as the song twists off in unexpected directions with sudden melodic breaks and interludes, and juxtaposes Wolfs lyrical darkness with sonic brightness.\nOf course, its worth noting that, for all the frolicking glee, Wolfs melancholy hasnt entirely vanished-- its just that its no longer quite so cheerless. Granted, for Wolf to have discovered optimism may seem like an ominous transformation to fans content to be swaddled in cryptic early gems like \"The Libertine\", but the distinctive, ornate qualities of his first two records remain. And whats taken the place of all that narcissistic grief-- a crucial sense of self-awareness and the resolution of some very elementary identity issues-- has allowed him an artistic and lyrical progression that results in refined and concentrated updates like \"The Stars\", which insightfully links family and nature, or the virtuosic ballad \"Augustine\", while retaining a spirited, anthemic quality that puts them confidently at home in the same body of work.",

        "article_text": "Its a little difficult not to hum the melody to \"Daydream Believer\" during the opening of \"Here Comes the Phantom\", the first track from the Clienteles third full-length album. The chords bump against those of the Monkees classic without mimicking them precisely; its not what is played that sounds so familiar, but how, as the piano moves with a whimsical bounce that evokes someone dancing in a brightly-lit studio with walls the color of a televisions test pattern. And when Alasdair MacLean begins to sing, its like all the rain that fell during the first 50 or so songs the Clientele recorded has finally given way to sunlight: \"April in my mind, but I cant sleep/ So I took a walk around the trees/ And what did I see?/ Summer waits in the leaves/ As lovely as Ive ever known.\" We hear of cops picking flowers while walking their beats and a heart that plays like a violin. Weve been introduced to a new Clientele world. But its not all golden shafts of light: \"Happiness just comes and goes,\" MacLean sings to finish out the verse.\nListening to God Save the Clientele I keep thinking of how, through their first two albums, various EPs, and the godlike singles collection Suburban Light, the Clientele seemed defined by a certain kind of thoughtful stasis. They were the band that to casual observers sounded the same from track to track, employing a handful of production tricks and a slightly larger handful of lyrical themes to articulate a rich and complex world informed by magical realism, memory, and the ache of nostalgia. For good or ill, this uniformity seems to be slipping away. God Save the Clientele sounds like the work of the same band, but it shows them in a new, brighter light, broadened in both sound and outlook. In terms of sonics and tunes, these changes are welcome and logical, expanding upon the sound with which they made their name without sacrificing intimacy or risking coming across overcooked.\nMost of these tracks were recorded by Lambchops Mark Nevers at his Beech House studio in Nashville. Brian OShaughnessy, who worked on Strange Geometry, also recorded two numbers and mixed the lot. String arrangements-- and there are lots of them-- are again by Louis Philippe, the indie pop veteran with the golden ears. Suffice to say, God Save sounds warm, balanced, and absolutely gorgeous. Nevers commitment to analog and his stated desire to recapture the depth of field of the finest recordings from the 1970s are matched well to the Clienteles classicist aesthetic. The range of guitar tones, along with tasteful use of orchestrations, piano, and pedal steel, has led to an album that sounds absurdly expensive and lush for an indie release.\nThe bands easy melodicism is intact. \"Here Comes the Phantom\" and \"Bookshop Casanova\" are the sort of peppy, tuneful pop that would have sounded odd coming from the Clientele five years ago. The latter has been remarked upon for its Beatles-referencing lyrics (\"Youve got my name/ Pick up my number/ Come on, darling/ Lets be lovers\") and an overall mood that brings to mind the Fab Four (seems like theres probably a writer of paperbacks lurking somewhere in this particular shop). \"Winter on Victoria Street\" sounds like a Clientele title of old but its another swinging track that, like \"Bookshop\", has lyrics that work the edge between longing and lust (\"Watching a movie and getting bored/ Trying to get up with the girl next door\"). \"The Queen of Seville\" might be the most beautiful ballad the band has recorded, with a Erik Satie-like piano line, acoustic guitar picking that oozes melancholy, and a radiant pedal steel that sounds dialed in from a rain-soaked countrypolitan dream.\nBalancing its sonic pleasures, God Save is more difficult to get a handle on lyrically. Which is ironic, considering that MacLeans words now seem simpler, more direct, and ultimately more grounded in pop tradition. On early singles like \"Reflections After Jane\", MacLeans viewpoint seemed utterly strange and simultaneously familiar, like he was pointing out things wed all noticed but no one had bothered to articulate. \"On the bridge the workers pass in threes and fours and fives,\" he sang back then, and you could see those dudes in your mind, striding along with their lunch pails, and you knew it was important even if you werent quite sure why. The instantly evocative couplets here are harder to find, and there are more references to a larger, more generalized big picture. Another of the albums stronger songs is titled \"From Brighton Beach to Santa Monica\", which is a whole lot of real estate, even if the verses are actually quite specific. (\"Voices in the park following us down to Vincent Street/ Ghosts inside the yard, rattling their balls and chains.\")\n\"The Dance of the Hours\" sets prose to music, and the quickly whispered words are impossible to catch on record. Fortunately, theyre included in the albums liners. The songs tale is quintessential Clientele, telling of a tiny knight found in a back garden by a child. Its the kind of story that could be covered in 10 words but MacLean takes a couple hundred anyway, teasing out every detail of the small figures appearance (\"I realize now that his delicate frame could only have been nourished by medieval foods: turnips, blood sausage, perhaps songbirds roasted in a thin, toxic sauce of mercury\") and circumstances. That feeling of a banal moment being imbued with so much potential significance, if only one would only take the time to comb through it, is what the Clienteles music captures at its very best. God Save may not get there quite as often as Strange Geometry or the songs collected on Suburban Light, but it does so much else right such potential shortcomings are easy to set aside.",

        "article_text": "“Hi-Five”, the third song on Angel Olsen’s second album, Burn Your Fire for No Witness, has got to be one of the most cheerful songs ever written about being lonely. A twangy electric folk tune that begins with an invocation of its muse, Hank Williams, the song is all stomp-and-rollick until it stops to catch its breath for a moment in the bridge. “Are you lonely too?” Olsen warbles. A beat later, her band’s back in full Technicolor, and the next line hits like a title card in an old “Batman” episode: “HI-FIVE!/ SO AM I!”\nOlsen’s voice is enchanting; it sounds like the result of a spell that called for Leonard Cohen’s blood, Buffy Sainte-Marie’s larynx, and a still-operational old-timey microphone emblazoned with radio call letters. Her songs are powered by a strange, anarchic electricity, always flickering on the edge of blowing out. By the laws of the unique universe she creates on her records, Wanting, Waiting, and (probably the most popular pastime in her songs) Thinking are not passive stances but active ways of being in the world; unruly emotion is a virtue. “You don’t sing so high and wild,” she sneers at one point to a detached lover, and in an Angel Olsen song this is an insult so harsh it’s almost obscene. This guy may as well be dead.\nOlsen first gained notice as the stand-out eccentric in Bonnie “Prince” Billy’s mysterious band the Babblers (given that all six of them were known perform in hooded pajamas and sunglasses, this is saying something). In 2010, she released an arresting tape on Bathetic called Strange Cacti, which gave off the impression that she’d recorded it after falling down a well, trying to sing loudly and cavernously and urgently enough to be found. And she was, more or less—her cult following multiplied with the release of 2012’s excellent Half Way Home, a surreal and lyrical collection of folk songs that sounded a bit like Vashti Bunyan playing a midnight game of Ouija. Most of the songs on Half Way Home were driven by Olsen’s hushed acoustic guitar, so her 2013 single “Sweet Dreams” was a thrilling left turn—a swirling, psych-pop reverie. To overpower the percussion and charred electric guitars, she sang even wilder.\nBurn Your Fire for No Witness picks up where “Sweet Dreams” left off, blossoming into a fuller, louder sound and embracing punchier song structures. It’s not as weird or raw a record as Half Way Home, but producer John Congleton manages to sand the rough edges off Olsen’s music without quite taming it. She and her band (Joshua Jaeger on drums and Stewart Bronaugh on bass and guitar) talk to each other effortlessly: On the great lead-off single “Fogiven/Forgotten”, the kick drum accents her open-hearted declarations like expertly placed exclamation points (“I don’t know anything!/ But I love you!”), and as the energy of “Lights Out” mounts, she passes the baton to Bronaugh for a perfectly timed solo. The blown-out, full-band energy enlivens Olsen, kindling an intensity that’s always been present in her songs and fanning the flames even higher.\nOn repeated listens, subtler highlights emerge. \"Enemy\" hangs like a spiderweb in the albums quietest corridor—an intricate wisp of a song that she patiently spins into something hallowed and heartbreaking. Then there’s “White Fire”, a sparse, nearly seven-minute incantation that sounds like a lost Songs of Leonard Cohen cut but gradually accumulates an atmosphere of its own. When Olsen switches into ballad mode, she fares best with hushed, minimal arrangements. The echoing percussion and shimmering chords of “Dance Slow Decades” cloak the song in a relatively ill-fitting grandeur; the demo is probably more of a gut-punch. Same goes for the indistinct closer “Window”, which sounds a bit too much like someone trying to write a Feist song. Still, that last one feels like such an anomaly that it only underscores how distinct Olsen’s songwriting is across the rest of the record. Burn Your Fire for No Witness conjures the past without ever imitating it, swirling its influences into something intimate, impressionistic and new.\n“I wish it were the same as it is in my mind,” Olsen laments in “Enemy”; this is pretty much the central conflict in every Angel Olsen song. The people she writes about daydream vividly, mumble reassuring mantras to themselves (\"Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind\"), and get so caught up in the songs stuck in their heads that they accidentally walk past their own houses. And yet, even as she longs for deep connections and hi-fives from strangers, Olsen knows too well that dreamers are usually loners. Not that she really minds. If she seems unafraid of—even superhumanly amped about—loneliness, it’s because her songs find an almost beatific peace in solitude. “If you can’t be psyched about your own thoughts,” she said in an interview a few years ago, “Then how are you supposed to have a meaningful interaction with anyone?” It’s a point she’s carried over into her music, honed in seclusion but now ready for more people to bear witness to its peculiar charms.",

        "article_text": "Theres plenty afoot in the metal underground-- its the mainstream version that desperately needs a new set of heroes. While junior-high faves Ozzy Osbourne, Guns n Roses, and Metallica look like they could no longer eat the rich without gnawing on their own fatuous fingers, Mastodon are on the cusp of arena-sized success. The Atlanta quartets already released two excellent full-lengths, 2002s Remission and 2004s Leviathan, as well as formative material in 2001s Lifesblood EP (which resurfaced earlier this year on Call of the Mastodon). If Blood Mountain, their brilliantly upsized and unrelenting third album, doesnt confirm their position as the greatest big-time metal crew on earth, I demand a state-by-state recount.\nAnyone paying attention to heavy rock knows Leviathan is held in near-religious regard in metal circles-- its an album that tops critical checklists and makes the kids shit their pants. Ive spent a lot of time listening to Leviathan and the new record in tandem, and at first I couldnt believe it myself but... Blood Mountain may be even better. No, Im not fucking with you. These 12 new tracks operate on a similar sonic level as their predecessors: Blood Mountain has the same producer, ex-Minus the Bear/current metal tweaker Matt Bayles, and though he obviously spent a lot more time layering substrata this time around, the recordings a lovely shade of dense.\nHere, Mastodons songwriting technique is refined, built upon, and doubled up, pushing the ingredients from their last album toward a more complex assault. It lands the band in totally fascinating realms: Leviathans post-Remission exploratory impulse picked up and sharpened, with the entire band playing rich polyrhythms at a level that (for now) appears unsurpassable. Ive heard shouts that the records just too precise. Nope. Tech for techs sake? How? Stranger yet, some have even written that Blood Mountain doesnt have hooks. It certainly does-- especially when those syrupy, psychedelic choruses and bridges feature increasingly stunning vocal performances by Brent Hinds and Troy Sanders, whove further developed as lyricists and howlers.\nLeviathan left listeners reaching for Moby Dick, on which it was based. Now ditching those literary analogues, Blood Mountain moves from the white whale to the bands Ahab-sized vision-quest up a fabled peak. For it, the band has concocted a conceptual world-- and like any good game of Dungeons and Dragons its journey includes trials, blizzard-condition soul searching, cannibalism, and various beasts, including a half-sasquatch cyclops (\"Circle of Cysquatch\") and a monster constructed from various smaller, leafy creatures that, together, form a forest (\"Colony of Birchmen\"). Its a fantastical trek, and it allows the group to remain on an elemental theme-- Remission was fire, Leviathan water, and Blood Mountain is earth-- while glorying in their own Maiden-sized storytelling. Considering all the farting that takes place in the bands Workhorse Chronicles DVD, Im afraid of what theyll do for wind.\nSongwise, Mastodon break out of the gate with \"The Wolf Is Loose\", a showcase of rapid-fire technical skill and songwriting chops. As usual, the guitars jab and interweave, drummer Brann Dailor melts minds with his fills, and the switch between vocalists finds the lyrics jumping from gruff gut-checks (\"The belly of the whale/ Refusal of return\") to Sabbathian soul (\"As the solider walks through the crimson side\"). There are more compelling costume changes and time shifts than you can count-- and from there, it never lets up. Starting with Dailor, this time playing 50-gallon drums like an shadowy marching band, the hydra-fed \"Crystal Skull\" includes a blistering vocal assist from Neurosis Scott Kelly. \"Sleeping Giant\" opens elegantly with a gloomy Isis nautical feel, before ripping into another slow psychedelic streak.\nIts a taut, flaw-free opening triad, and looking beyond it, there isnt a dud in the bunch. Highlights? \"Capillarian Crest\" is mathy prog-metal that glides unrelentingly between whip-smart crescendos. \"Circle of Cysquatch\" tackles dark Meshuggah-esque thrashing and includes a bleak vocoder part. Jazz-fucking instrumental \"Bladecatcher\" layers Drive Like Jehu birdcalls over crunch and classical scale-riding. Guest vocalist Josh Homme adds trills to \"Colony of Birchmen\"s dense fun-house mirror, providing the albums catchiest moment. The records final few tracks are increasingly huge, culminating in the \"Siberian Divide\", in which our hero eats his own flesh when his mind is fucked by the Snow Queen. The Mars Volta-style intro had me nervous, but its yet another perfect shapeshift between psych density and metal growl. And props where props are due: Cedric Bixler-Zavala contributes and actually adds an interesting vocal angle.\nThe one misstep? After the last track, following 17 minutes of silence, Homme stumbles over a supposedly self-penned fan letter to the band: \"Dear Mastodon, my name is Joshua, Im a big fan from Southern Cal. Really diggin on your new scene. Thats why I hope you dont mind when I got your new demos for your new CD, I had to sing parts on them and send them to you as a tribute,\" etc. Dorky, yeah, but giddy enough and easily overlooked. Plan: When you get to the final notes of \"Pendulous Skin\", press stop and start again.\nThe records liners contain mountain-climber texts that add a great old school-sized aspect to Blood Mountain, but that trek to the snowy summit could also refer to Mastodons ascension of the major label monolith. On the way, they may not have literally battled a cyclops or scored the crystal skull (though, guessing they found some okay weed), but they have returned to solid ground with their most awe-inspiring album to date. Please welcome the new monsters of rock.",

        "article_text": "Disliking teen-pop gets you cast as some sort of rockist Luddite these days, but beyond the fact that most of it doesnt sound like stuff Id have wanted to hear as a high schooler, it doesnt feel like music for teens either. (Hell, its more tween-pop than teen-pop anyway.) But what about the kind of stuff that, say, the \"1979\" video lionized-- breaking into your folks liquor cabinet, obliterating the speed limit despite just getting your learners permit, leaving your hometown for the first time and discovering how small it feels. What about jamming out with your best bud and deciding to call it a band?\nThese are the kind of gut-level concerns Post-Nothing trades in, and I know, on paper it describes an itch that a late-1990s Vagrant record could scratch. And combined with the fact that the band is called freakin Japandroids, its easy to not take it seriously. Which is fine, since Japandroids do not make particularly complex music: Brian King plays broad chords stewed in mid-90s fuzz (think Superchunk) while David Prowse splays spastic but never showy drum fills that beg to be pounded out on your steering wheel. Theres maybe one overdub on the whole thing and occasionally, both of them yell at the same time. Several songs have less than five lines. And while theyve been known to cover Mcluskys \"To Hell With Good Intentions\" live, what makes Post-Nothing such a blast is how Japandroids tend to embody the opposite sentiment of that song title. This is terminally catchy music played with punks enthusiasm and velocity, and maybe its the fact that theres only two dudes in this band that makes you feel like joining in to bash along. Its as fun as an ill-gotten sixpack and there really arent too many bands doing stuff like this well anymore.\nRecent trends, however, might make you think otherwise: Due to their two-man setup and no-frills recording, Japandroids risk being lumped into the increasingly tiresome no-fi/noise-pop scene that finds bands using distortion to tear through the fabric of the medium and, in some cases, drown out weak songs. Either way, theres some form of obfuscation, but what makes Post-Nothing  such a thrill is the manner in which Japandroids hold absolutely nothing back. As contagious as any of the lyrics, melodies, riffs, or drum fills are, their energy and lack of self-consciousness is every bit as equally lovable. Opening mission statement \"The Boys Are Leaving Town\" could be seen as a goof on Thin Lizzy, but the response, \"Will we find our way back home?\", is delivered with such conviction that between those two lines, \"Boys\" displays a palpable desperation. Six tracks later, the question is still unresolved-- amidst the cyclical thrum of \"Sovereignty\", they observe: \"Its raining, OH-OH! in Vancouver/ But I dont give a fuck/ Cause Im far from home tonight.\"\nSo yeah, its a record about distance. For the most part its a record about the distance between themselves and girls. Too often, similar records find themselves lapsing into easy misogyny, and while \"Heart Sweats\" skirts the issue, the in-jokes are kinda duds. Nonetheless, its thick riff is a good introduction to the less excitable but still very exciting side B. \"Crazy/Forever\" is heaving stoner rock (think Black Mountain with hooks), and closer \"I Quit Girls\" is about as close to a power ballad as Japandroids will allow themselves. Its full of musical drama-- King reaches for falsetto amidst almost-synthetic guitar EQing and its the longest stretch of time with no drumming, but the whole thing is leavened by a tongue-in-cheek pledge of devotion from Rowse: \"After her, I quit girls.\"\nThe distance is emotional as well as physical on \"Wet Hair\", and Ill be surprised if I play another song in 2009 as much as this one. Its structure is almost comically linear-- theres three lines in the whole thing, and the most ridiculous one gets repeated for nearly half of its three minutes, something about going to France to French kiss some French girls. Theres hardly even a verse-chorus structure, just a single melody that repeats itself faster after the drums drop out. But its one hell of a melody, and its lyric, like much of Post-Nothing, doesnt need to be analyzed or even  understood to be felt.\nWhere it all comes together best is \"Young Hearts Spark Fire\". Almost a flipside to LCD Soundsystems \"All My Friends\", its thematically similar, trading wistful reminiscence for drunken defiance and pulsing electro for chaotic garage rock. The five minutes go by in a blur, and amidst the guitar heroics and cymbal-bashing, King lets his guard down on Post-Nothings key line-- \"We used to dream/ Now we worry about dying/ I dont want to worry about dying.\" It would be so easy to view this sort of musical and lyrical directness with suspicion, but \"Young Hearts\" is life-affirming stuff-- if only it affirms that, even in these times, life doesnt need to be as complicated as we tend to make it.",

        "article_text": "On Field of Reeds’ title and final track, Jack Barnett idly sings, “You asked if the islands would float away… I said, yes.” The answer comes back with a dead-eyed conviction that makes it feel as if Barnett has lost sight of the solid shoreline, something hell definitely be accused of with These New Puritans’ third album. It sees the Southend group all but shed any assocations they once had with the wider rock world, reinventing themselves as a neo-classical ensemble. The result is an uncompromisingly self-possessed record whose intimate qualities shouldnt be mistaken for an easy listen-- in many respects, its clearest analog is Talk Talk’s Spirit of Eden. It opens with a Portuguese jazz vocalist, Elisa Rodrigues, singing a sparkling, barely half-remembered version of Herb Alpert’s “This Guy’s in Love With You”. As it ends, Adrian Peacock, who has the lowest known singing voice in Britain, unleashes an apparently bottomless vocal drone, sounding as if he’s humming along to a Sunn O))) song, while Barnett chants in phonetics like a tricksy goblin.\nDespite releasing three markedly different albums over the past five years, the Puritans have earned the trust of their audience, allowing them to go wherever their iconoclastic spirit takes them. Their debut album, 2008’s Beat Pyramid, took the moony British post-punk phenomenon of the preceding few years and made it nasty, agitated, and wholly uninterested in emotive melancholy or accessible lyrical subjects. Numerology and olde magick were central, though good luck trying to prise much else from it. “You know I’ll be thinking this music’s symbolic/ This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I/ You’ll be slashing at the air, describing nothing,” Barnett sang with deterrent glee on “Swords of Truth”. Hes been equally oblique describing Field of Reeds. “I’m just putting one sound in front of the other and thinking about what comes next,” he told the Guardian.\nIts follow-up, 2010’s Hidden, sounded like a strikingly, elegantly choreographed war, at once global and gothic with its destructive beats, mournful laments, and taunting vocals. And now, Field of Reeds is a stilled, abstract pastoral of sorts, where the music seems to grow and swarm as naturally as moss across rocks. Its closest modern peer might be Julia Holters equally pristine Ekstasis. Where Hidden traded in damning impact, Field of Reeds uses Barnett’s self-taught compositional prowess-- and the borrowed skills of composers André de Ridder, Michel van der Aa, and Hans Ek-- to explore the effects of memory, requiring investment on the listeners part, too; “Spiral” seems to repeat a clarinet motif from Hidden; “Organ Eternal” rekindles the glassy pulse of “V (Island Song)” with the resonator piano, a riff that in turn strongly recalls “Tubular Bells”.\nField of Reeds was recorded over 12 months in three different studios. The drums were added around structures determined by the strings, horns, and magnetic resonator piano-- a haunted, silvery-sounding creation-- and barely appear at all in the album’s final third (Barnett has suggested there are three movements here). Somehow, the effect is more intimidating than the parts on Hidden where they smashed melons to simulate crushing a skull. The spareness and sense of space on Field of Reeds is remarkable, the kind thatll make you glance over your shoulder as beguiling mercury-slicked glows slip into an overwhelming, sometimes vicious sense of anxiety; \"There is something there,\" as Barnett sings on \"Fragment Two\".\nThese shifts are made even more unsettling by the lack of aggression in the playing; where Hidden’s M.O. could be found in “Attack Music”, on Field of Reeds there’s the sense that these glowing clarinets and strings are occurring naturally, almost as if emanating from a landscape. Gone too is the obtuse vocal phrasing that ran through Beat Pyramid and Hidden; Barnett has talked about spending “hours going through each sentence of the lyrics getting rid of all the consonants,” a defamiliarizing effect that makes his lines as slippery and memory-foxing as the dream-speak in “Twin Peaks”. Its as upsetting too; Field of Reeds quiet lyrical narrative seems to follow a period of loss; first a person, and subsequently, trust in any kind of concrete meaning, underpinned by the way lines disintegrate into phonetic babble. As his fastidious techniques show, Barnett is a total perfectionist-- he proudly made George play 76 drum takes on one song-- yet his control freakiness hasn’t killed the record; the effect is naturalistic, and often deeply moving, rather than in any way inert.\nWhile Field of Reeds is a mysterious album in many ways, what it makes clear is Barnett’s faith in the purity of sound, rather than words, to communicate; remember, \"This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I.\" By removing any imposition of context, his words of consonants, his music of attention-grabbing impact, his ensemble of rock band-status, he’s created a truly strange and beautiful record. Whether Barnett makes it explicit or not, These New Puritans’ songs have always been concerned with their South-Easterly corner of the coast, the smoggy bowel of London where rusting World War II fortifications stand demilitarized among the islands, just like the sounds on this album. “Secret recordings were made in the marsh,” Barnett chanted on Hidden’s “We Want War”. It feels as though he finally trusts us to hear them on Field of Reeds.",

        "article_text": "Forgiveness is not a sentiment often associated with rock music. Anger, despair, infatuation, sure. But forgiveness is more complicated, and tougher to fit into a four-minute song. Broken Social Scene know all about heartbreak-- theyve spent most of the last decade crafting songs about it with almost unparalleled zeal. Their story is filled with scurrilous encounters, backstabbings, and break-ups on par with most 70s arena-rockers, and theyve crashed and rebuilt so many times that its nearly impossible to keep track of who was where at any given moment. But theyve also used that flexibility to their advantage: Their epochal 2002 breakout You Forgot It In People was the joyous sound of friends banding together to boost each other up, while 2005s Broken Social Scene was the dizzying sound of friends fizzing out into solo endeavors and outside pursuits.\nNow theyre back, and theyre forgiving. Who, exactly? Each other, loves, bad decisions, humanity at large, worse decisions, the past, the future, culture, corporations, art, you, me, maybe even George W. Bush. (Well, maybe not him.) And while a 59-minute absolution session sounds excessive for even the most devout fans, Broken Social Scene arent just throwing out hail marys here. Because forgiveness is hard, especially for a group this grand and this intertwined for this long. The album lets bygones go while acknowledging the pain and discipline involved, and does so while keeping with the bands indie-mixtape rep. Theres a song that sounds like Pavement, one that sounds like the Sea and Cake (featuring Sea and Cake singer Sam Prekop), another like a Broadway adaptation of Children of Men, a weightless ballad that may double as an ode to masturbation, and a song thats basically five minutes of atmospheric pop perfection. Their ambition is intact.\nForgiveness Rock Records thematic bent is mature, and that sense of gravity is embedded into the music, too. Working with band hero, Tortoise/Sea and Cake drummer, and post-rock mastermind John McEntire for the first time, Broken Social Scene made sure to have their shit together. Considering the co-producers experimental bona fides, its surprising that this is the most song-based album the band has ever made-- every track but one contains vocals, and a couple seem to be filled with more words than the entirety of You Forgot It In People. Unlike their last albums sometimes indulgent cut-and-paste sonic collages, Forgiveness has distinct targets and leaves little room for wayward meanders.\nThe bands newfound tightness results in a few of the most chart-friendly songs in BSS history, although as usual, each seems to come with a built-in caveat to prevent the potential of radio play: the sweat-soaked \"World Sick\", with its massive crescendos building to one visceral, heart-pounding release after another, is nearly seven minutes long with extended instrumental intros and outros. \"Texico Bitches\", despite its misleading breezy accompaniment, is an increasingly topical indictment of big oil that repeats the word \"bitches\" 12 times. And the vocals on the beautiful, synth-laden \"All to All\" are serviceably performed by relative newcomer Lisa Lobsinger, where Leslie Feists stronger, more possessed delivery may have pushed it into another weight class entirely. (Feist does show up on Forgiveness, but only for background vocals.)\nAs an alt-hippie with obsessions for Dinosaur Jr., Jeff Buckley, and Ennio Morricone, BSS main face Kevin Drew led the burgeoning band to somewhere completely fresh with You Forgot It In People, an album that read like a non-ironic, indie-rock Odelay for the early 2000s. For the most part, Drew and company are referencing the same beloved bands on Forgiveness, with one key addition: Broken Social Scene themselves. There are now marks that listeners expect them to hit, and theyre nailed with focus and precision: the peppy, horn-laden track from Apostle of Hustles Andrew Whiteman (\"Art House Director\"), the back-of-the-bus acoustic session (\"Highway Slipper Jam\"), the immense instrumental to end all immense instrumentals (\"Meet Me in the Basement\"). All of those tracks excellently fill their respective niches, but the fact that there are niches at all adds a bittersweet tinge to a band that once sounded like everything else and nothing else.\nWhich leads us to the indiscretion summary \"Sentimental Xs\". It checks off another BSS box-- the subtly devastating Emily Haines-sung heart-tugger. \"Off and on is what we want,\" sings Haines, narrating the bands gift-and-curse plight, \"A friend of a friend you used to call/ Or a friend of a friend you used/ You used to call.\" Which is what Broken Social Scene is: a mess of friends using friends, loving friends, calling friends, wanting to call friends, and then not calling friends anymore. The connections are transitory but also indestructible. Ultimately, \"Sentimental Xs\" is a love song; theres lots of forgiveness, but nobody feels sorry.",

        "article_text": "Album titles can often sum up the albums themselves. Case in point: the Morning Benders 2008 debut, Talking Through Tin Cans, a collection of boilerplate indie rock that borrowed more than a bit from the Shins jangle pop. Despite a few bright spots, the record branded the San Franciscan outfit with a second-tier reputation. Add that to the fact that the Shins arent groundbreakers themselves, and Talking Through Tin Cans begins to sound as limited as the rudimentary childrens activity suggested in its title.\nThe title to the Benders sophomore effort and Rough Trade debut, Big Echo, appropriately evokes their sonic shift in the past two years. The album is a homecoming of sorts, as it finds the Morning Benders correcting their PacNW indie pop identity crisis in favor of a more coastal, kaleidoscopic California haze. It also finds them embracing the cavernous experimental rock sound of Grizzly Bear, whose Chris Taylor shares a co-production credit with Benders singer/guitarist Christopher Chu.\nBig Echo kicks off with \"Excuses\", a sunny, lilting little ditty that carries simultaneous debts to 1950s pop balladry and Sgt. Peppers-inspired orchestral mania. The song is an easygoing and excellent introduction to the Benders stylistic changes, and its charming melody serves as an adequate explanation as to how these guys got so many San Franciscan music notables into one room to perform the tune for videographers Yours Truly.\nThe trio that follow \"Excuses\" round out Big Echos more accessible front-end and come closest to the Benders previous, less complicated sound. Even then, the band finds ways to add touches of weirdness to each track. \"Promises\" may be just another song about an uncertain relationship, but the songs big-beat thump and tangled voices add something sticky to the bittersweet presentation. The simple shuffle of \"Wet Cement\" is augmented by scale-sliding background vocals, while the economical \"Cold War (Nice Clean Fight)\" features glockenspiel to accentuate its ramshackle charm.\nBig Echos second half is slightly slower and swampier than its first; its also where the bands newfound Grizzly Bear influence comes through clearest, from the jagged guitars that crack open \"Hand Me Downs\" to the breathy, multi-part swooning of \"Pleasure Sighs\" and \"Stitches\". Taylors studio presence is all over Big Echo, from the warped music-hall strings of \"Excuses\" to the hymn-like, soft-focus vocals on album closer \"Sleeping In\". This cavernous production gives Big Echo another titular double-meaning, lending gravitas and providing guitarists Christopher and Jonathan Chu room to stretch amidst the wooly arrangements.\nGiving too much credit to Taylors influence and direction, however, undermines the Morning Benders stylistic transition, one any band would envy and many listeners will love. Many bands spend entire careers trying (and failing) to even nail down the one thing theyre good at. The Morning Benders have already found a handful. Heres hoping they continue down the path illustrated on Big Echos gorgeous oil-painted album cover: into the unsure seas, and away from the relative safety of stable terrain.",

        "article_text": "Forget the cartoon characters. Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewletts animated misfits have always been mainly interesting as a concept, and on much of the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, it feels like Albarn and co. are ditching the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front anyway. The one-time Blur frontman has transcended some of the post-modern artifice of this project, and created the groups most affecting and uniquely inviting album. Jokes over, Gorillaz are real.\nSo why make this a Gorillaz album in the first place? It wasnt meant to be one. Hewlett, the celebrated Tank Girl co-creator, told The Observer last July, \"Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters anymore-- its more like an organization of people doing new projects.\" The project was to be called Carousel, presented by, but not performed by, Gorillaz. It never panned out. So Albarn devised Plastic Beach, a loose enviromental-song cycle warning against disposability. Its a noble conceit, if a transient one.\nAlong with a typically diverse band of collaborators, Albarn dips into Krautrock, funk, and dubstep, as well as the weary, more melodic music hes been perfecting for much of last decade-- sort of an electronic take on baroque pop. Albarn also sounds more comfortable as a leader here than he has in some time. On the standout \"On Melancholy Hill\", he recalls the swooning strains of one of his heroes, Scott Walker. And when he shares or cedes vocals, he has the good sense to turn things over to luminaries like Lou Reed (magnificently dry-throated on \"Some Kind of Nature\") and Bobby Womack (good on first single \"Stylo\", better on the twangy \"Cloud of Unknowing\"), while effortlessly integrating them into the sound.\nHandling most of the production himself, Albarn has reversed the good fortune of the first two Gorillaz albums. With Dan the Automator on their 2001 self-titled debut and Danger Mouse on 2005s Demon Days, the group was adept at fusing giddy pop with hip-hop, inserting De La Soul, Del the Funky Homosapien, or a yippy Miho Hatori into some of their best songs (\"Clint Eastwood\", \"Dirty Harry\", \"Feel Good Inc.\", \"19-2000\"). Those songs crashed in from all places with little mind to sequence or balance, and the result was two fairly unfocused records saved by some decent alt-rap.\nOn Plastic Beach, things are the other way around. The rap moments here feel almost needlessly idiosyncratic amidst the lusher treatments. Snoop Doggs appearance on \"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\" is an incongruous introduction to an album that has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg. De La repeat themselves on the faux jingle \"Superfast Jellyfish\". Grime MCs Kano and Bashy compellingly play pass-the-baton on \"White Flag\", but only after disrupting an absorbing intro and outro by the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. Only on \"Sweepstakes\" is Mos Def able to assimilate into the production.\nAlbarn is more natural when working in the kind of ornate Village Green Preservation Society-style pop that dominates Plastic Beach. His collaborations with Little Dragon, \"Empire Ants\" and \"To Binge\" are two of the most arresting things here-- theyre airy, elusive, and amazingly beautiful. Its been years since Albarn has written anything as blatantly gorgeous. If he had to work past the animated pretense to rediscover it, all the better. Why be a cartoon when you can be a real person?",

        "article_text": "Once in a while a record comes along that makes you re-think loud: King of Rock; The Land of Rape and Honey; Nation of Millions; Super Ae; I Get Wet; Kesto. Setting aside the quality of the material-- there are classics here, along with albums I never listen to anymore-- these albums are notable for me because the first time I heard them, music just seemed bigger than it had before, like it took up more space and hit with more force and went further than once seemed possible. When I was getting into these records, Id get a specific kind of kick just from putting them on. They felt like rides at an amusement park, and Id get a feeling in my stomach when the first notes kicked in: Here we go. Im adding another record to my list.\nDemos of songs from Sleigh Bells Treats first started making their way around the Internet last fall, and they immediately served as conversation starters. The distortion in early track \"Crown on the Ground\" was so intense that every other second the song seemed on the verge of shutting down. But while Derek Millers overdriven guitar and bass were distressed in the extreme, vocalist Alexis Krauss remained calm as chaos raged around her. Her cadence, somewhere at the intersection of singing, speaking, and chanting, conveyed an easy confidence, like she belonged in the middle of this maelstrom and knew she didnt need to shout to be heard. The contrast between her relaxed bearing-- where she seemed to rule over it all-- and the dangerous splatter of the music was striking to say the least. It was as easy to be taken in as it was to understand why someone else might be repelled. I felt some of both feelings, to be honest, but I also wanted to hear more.\nTreats delivers completely on the promise of those demos. Sleigh Bells havent stopped living in the red, but the improved recording quality makes songs including \"Crown on the Ground\" that much heavier, and the duo have managed to extend their uncomplicated formula across 11 tracks without it wearing thin. The combination of the musics essentials-- jackhammer riffs clipped from punk and metal, mid-tempo beats from hip-hop and electro, and supremely catchy sing-song melodies-- is striking on its own, sounding remarkably fresh and unlike anything else right now. But an even greater source of the records appeal is how it doesnt sound especially referential.\nWhen so much music seems designed to evoke the mood and vibe of a specific era, either through direct imitation or playing with the memories of the musics context, Sleigh Bells deftly avoid any single pigeonhole. There are references, but it never feels like the music is merely pointing. Genre here is something to be twisted around and pulled and braided with something else, a mangled container struggling to hold the energy and ecstasy of the music. They gather up bits from all over and use them to create music that puts you squarely in the present moment.\nThe music hits so hard, and in such a satisfying way, and it seems designed to bring you back to the totality of the sound. Its hard to say what the songs are about, since so many words are so difficult to make out, but they work. The lyrics of \"A/B Machines\" consist only of, \"Got my A machines on the table/ Got my B machines in the drawer,\" repeated over and over, and who am I to question Krauss on this point? Were talking about \"a-wop bop a-loo bop a-lop bam boom\" and \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" here, which is just right for what the music tries for.\nSo my ear on \"A/B Machines\" goes to the searing guitar lead, which screeches out a few penetrating notes, and then pauses on the clanging low-end and the interludes and Western-sounding guitar rumble. And on the opening \"Tell Em\", the focus goes to the call-and-response drum machine pummel, soaring riff, and finger snaps compressed into sharp little diamonds, as Krauss chirps a short, repetitive melody with the insistence of a pep rally cheer. \"Rill Rill\" takes the immortal acoustic guitar bit from Funkadelics \"Can You Get to That\", blows it up to Hollywood blockbuster size, and loops it along with clicking percussion as Krauss sings what may prove to be the pop earworm of the year, the kind of tune youd swear you were singing over and over to yourself years ago. \"Straight As\" has some of the electro-punk rage of Crystal Castles, the less frantic tracks like \"Rachel\" have a bit of shoegaze, and the pacing of the album is just so, taking you right to edge in one song and then pulling you back a few inches in the next.\nThough both Krauss and Miller have been making music for a while-- he in the hardcore band Poison the Well, she in some kind of manufactured teen-pop group that never got off the ground-- its easy to see them as a connected band with the right gimmick at the right time. They live in New York, theyve played hip shows for important people, and from the beginning the online chatter has been almost as deafening as the guitar tones. But what works in their favor is that theyve taken advantage of these breaks and marshaled their talent to make something that oozes joy. Theres spirit to this music, and the sonic assault is celebratory, asking only that you come along with it and join in. All of which, for me, anyway, makes the hype melt away. And if its true that records this intense and exhilarating dont always sustain themselves over the long haul, thats not a worry either. The visceral thrill of Treats may not last forever, but neither does life; right now, this feels like living it.",

        "article_text": "On \"Wild Man\", the first single from Kate Bushs winterized 10th album, the singer tells of an expedition searching for the elusive Abominable Snowman. \"They want to know you,\" she coos, \"They will hunt you down, then they will kill you/ Run away, run away, run away.\" Of course, when it comes to modern popular figures-- who often court fame and adulation with an obsessiveness that can be fascinating or just plain sad-- Bush herself is something of a mythical beast. 50 Words for Snow is only her second album of original material in the last 17 years, and she hasnt performed a full concert since her groundbreaking and theatrical Tour of Life wrapped up its six-week run in 1979. So its no surprise that she readily sympathizes with the misunderstood monster at the center of \"Wild Man\": \"Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside/ You sound lonely.\"\n50 Words for Snow is teeming with classic Bush-ian characterizations and stories-- fantasies, personifications, ghosts, mysteries, angels, immortals. As quoted in Graeme Thomsons thorough, thoughtful recent biography Under the Ivy, she explained her attraction to such songwriting: \"[Songs] are just like a little story: you are in a situation, you are this character. This is what happens. End. Thats what human beings want desperately. We all love being read stories, and none of us get it anymore.\" Shes onto something; in our postmodern era, the idea of a tale can seem quaint and simple.\nBut Bush continues to infuse her narratives with a beguiling complexity while retaining some old-school directness. Because while most of this albums songs can be easily summarized-- \"Snowflake\" chronicles the journey of a piece of snow falling to the ground; \"Lake Tahoe\" tells of a watery spirit searching for her dog; \"Misty\" is the one about the woman who sleeps with a lusty snowman (!)-- they contain wondrous multitudes thanks to the singers still-expressive voice and knack for uncanny arrangements. And mood. Theres an appealing creepiness that runs through this album, one that recalls the atmospheric and conceptual back half of her 1985 masterpiece Hounds of Love. Indeed, when considering this singular artist in 2011, its difficult to think of worthy points of reference aside from Bush herself; her onetime art-rock compatriots David Bowie and Peter Gabriel are currently MIA and in rehash mode, respectively. And while current acts including Florence and the Machine are heavily inspired by Bushs early career and spiritual preoccupations, none are quite able to match their idols particular brand of heart-on-sleeve mysticism. In an interview earlier this year, the 53-year-old Bush told me she doesnt listen to much new music, and after listening to the stunningly subtle and understated sounds on Snow, its easy to believe her.\nThe albums shortest song, the gorgeous closing piano ballad \"Among Angels\", clocks in at almost seven minutes. \"Misty\" rolls out its brilliant, funny, and bizarrely touching tale across nearly a quarter of an hour. Its not one second too long. During the 12-year gap between 1993s The Red Shoes and 2005s Aerial when she was raising her son Bertie, Bush gained a new level of compositional patience. Shes now allowing her songs to breathe more than ever-- a fact reinforced by this years Directors Cut, which found her classing-up and often stretching out songs from 1989s The Sensual World and The Red Shoes via re-recordings. So while \"Misty\" is an eyebrow-raiser about getting very intimate with a cold and white being with a \"crooked mouth full of dead leaves,\" it hardly calls attention to its own eccentricities. Propelled by Bushs languid piano and the jazzy, pitter-pattering drums of veteran stick man (but relatively new Bush recruit) Steve Gadd, the song is about as appealingly grown-up as a song about having sex with a snowman can possibly be. In her early career, Bush sometimes let her zaniness get the better of her, highlighting her tales of sexual taboo and bizarre yarns with look-at-me musical accompaniment and videos. Those days are long gone. And her heightened sophistication works wonders here. So when the songs titular being is nowhere to be found the following morning-- \"the sheets are soaking,\" she sings-- there is nothing gimmicky about her desperation: \"Oh please, can you help me?/ He must be somewhere.\"\nThe ending of that song brings up another common thread through Snow, aside from its blizzard-y climate. This is an album about trying, oftentimes futilely, to find connections-- between Bush and her characters, reality and surreality, love and death. \"Snowflake\" is a duet with her 13-year-old son, where he plays the small fleck of white falling down from the sky, his high-pitched, choir-boy voice hitting the kind of notes his mom was originally famous for. On the track, Bush encourages her son-- \"The world is so loud/ Keep falling/ Ill find you\"-- and yet the plaintive piano that steers things is seemingly aware that, once the flake arrives, itll either melt or disappear among millions of other icy bits. Similarly, while the lake-bound ghost of \"Lake Tahoe\" is overjoyed to find her long-lost dog-- coincidentally named Snowflake-- at the end of the song, the reunion comes with its own specter of bittersweet afterlife. The same sort of disconnect defines \"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\", an eerie duet with Bushs teenage idol Elton John about a star-crossed pair who have \"been in love forever\"-- literally. The time-traveling track finds its leads going from ancient Rome to World War II to 9/11, always losing each other along the way. It acts as something of a sequel to Bushs \"Running Up that Hill\", another tale of pained co-dependence. Theres no happy ending. \"When we got to the top of the hill/ We saw Rome burning,\" sings Elton.\nWhile much of 50 Words for Snow conjures a whited-out, dream-like state of disbelief, its important to note that Bush does everything in her power to make all the shadowy phantoms here feel real. Her best music, this album included, has the effect of putting one in the kind of treasured, child-like space-- not so much innocent as open to imagination-- that never gets old. \"I have a theory that there are parts of our mental worlds that are still based around the age between five and eight, and we just kind of pretend to be grown-up,\" she recently told The Independent. \"Our essence is there in a much more powerful way when were children, and if youre lucky enough to... hang onto who you are, you do have that at your core for the rest of your life.\" Snow isnt a blissful retreat to simpler times, though. Its fraught with endings, loss, quiet-- adult things. This is more than pure fantasy. When faced with her unlikely guest on \"Misty\", Bush pinches herself: \"Should be a dream, but Im not sleepy.\"",

        "article_text": "When the Irish techno producer Donnacha Costello released his debut album, Growing Up in Public, its title crystallized a key dilemma of any emerging artist: At what point do you decide youre ready to venture out of the bedroom? That was back in 2000, well before the internet had shifted into high gear; since then, the coming-out process has gotten only harder.\nBarcelonas John Talabot and his first album, ƒIN, make for an interesting case study of the musical debutant: This is actually the artists second time around. Under a different alias, as a resident DJ at one of Barcelonas techno institutions, he began his recording career in the mid 2000s, making punchy, melodic dance music with a clear debt to labels such as BPitch Control and Border Community. A few years later, around the same time that Barcelonas techno scene and the styles that fueled it began to go stale, his own productions began to shift. He eased into a mid-tempo chug and set aside buzzing synthesizers in favor of sun-bleached samples, trading neon fizz for dandelion fluff. Like a company de-listing itself from the stock market, the local fixture took himself private, assuming a new alias and wiping the slate clean.\nIt was a smart move. In the past two years, Talabot has become an exemplar of a new breed of producers working at the intersection of deep house, disco, and indie pop, and he has carved out his own niche somewhere between the slow-motion theatrics of artists such as Mark E and Tensnake, the globe-trotting jewel tones of Four Tet and Caribou, and the psych-pop rush of Animal Collective and Delorean. Having interviewed him a few times, I dont think theres a calculating bone in the-artist-currently-known-as-John-Talabots body, but he has nevertheless benefited from being in the right place at the right time. His slow tempos, supersaturated colors, and tropical accents fit right in with the woozy, humid dance music thats currently in vogue, and he has found himself in esteemed company-- remixing the xx, recruiting Glassers Cameron Mesirow for guest vocals, and releasing on Young Turks. Hes currently on tour in Australia with SBTRKT, another indicator that his star is on the rise.\nIronically, this all means that, his quasi-anonymity aside, Talabot finds himself growing up in public all over again as he graduates from singles and remixes to the full-length album form. Perhaps its those raised stakes that make ƒIN feel like such a triumph. Across the albums 11 tracks, Talabot builds upon his distinctive sound-- bursting with color, nostalgic but never retro, easy-going yet slightly unhinged-- without repeating himself.\nTalabots early singles tended to follow a single trajectory, beginning with a bed of chunky percussion and then piling on loops of acoustic guitars, Philly strings, and soaring, pitched-up voices, usually culminating in a swollen, almost over-the-top climax. He hasnt entirely abandoned that approach, but he hasnt remained shackled to it, partly because he has shortened his track times considerably: Where his singles and remixes routinely ran seven, eight, even nine minutes, most of ƒINs tracks come in around the four-minute mark, giving him the opportunity to experiment with more modest ideas that say their piece and move on.\nThe albums first three songs show off his range. The opening \"Depak Ine\"-- at seven-and-a-half minutes, its the LPs longest cut-- is disco by way of Depeche Mode, with stabbing synths, eerie vocal samples, and an inexplicable chorus of croaking frogs. (The title resembles the brand name of a mood-stabilizing drug, which might explain the shift from minor to major halfway through; perhaps the frogs denote side effects?) \"Destiny\", a co-production with Madrids Pional, is one of the albums obvious standouts, with beautifully harmonized vocals over lilting Caribbean chimes and a cozy, reassuring chord progression. Then, like a kind of palate cleanser, the three-minute \"El Oeste\" is a sleek little miniature of melting synthesizers, scraggly drum machines and dub delay that gradually swells into a folky, Boards of Canada-gone-house vibe.\nA few times, Talabot tries to recreate the sensation that he nailed on \"Sunshine\", an early hit that was as subtle as an ice-cream headache. With its stabbing chords and sped-up vocal loops, \"When the Past Was Present\" shows Talabot at his excessive best-- buzzing and slightly out of tune, with everything pushed into the red and teetering on the verge of collapse. \"Journeys\", the albums only misstep, goes for the same vibe, but theres something clunky about its construction, and the vocals, from Deloreans Ekhi Lopetegi, can be distractingly pitchy.\nA kind of happy melancholy informs most of the album, but that unity of mood doesnt get in the way of the songs potential to surprise. As many times as I listen, I keep discovering new sounds, phrases, and even entire songs that had previously passed me by, such as \"Estiu\", a demure, three-minute funk bumper that sounds like Dâm-Funk on Percoset, or \"Last Land\", whose breakbeat sounds based on the same sample used in Mr. Cheeks 2001 club-rap hit \"Lights, Camera, Action!\".\nƒIN saves its best song for last: \"So Will Be Now...\", another Pional co-production, which loops sampled vocals into a dreamy haze before digging into a sparse, deep-house groove. Its restrained, but theres real power there. A friend raved to me about how the song moved the dance floor at Berlins Panorama Bar one Sunday morning. On your home speakers, its as comforting as a lullaby, but played loud, apparently, those stark finger snaps and swooning coos are a call to collective ecstasy. Those contradictory qualities inform the whole record as it luxuriates in the space between private and public, just as its ambiguous title blurs the line between ends and means.",

        "article_text": "Schoolboy Q is the most promising foot soldier in Kendrick Lamars Black Hippy crew, a small circle of talented rappers currently reinventing West Coast hip-hop, but hes more than that. His second full-length statement, Habits \u0026 Contradictions, is a sumptuously produced and deeply enjoyable hour-plus slab of weed-clouded rap, but its more than that. Ive spent the past four days immersed in it, trying to resolve its conflicting impulses and ferret out all of its weird corners, and the only thing I can say for certain is that, while listening to it, I feel pulled completely into someone elses center of gravity, which is maybe the most gratifying listeners sensation there is.\nThe records first layer is sheer sound: Habits \u0026 Contradictions is full of plush, inviting, high-thread-count production, the kind that pulls you toward fat headphones and a chair. Like Kendrick Lamars Section.80, there is a woozy drag to the drums and a thick, clotted feel to the sounds surrounding them. It shares a metabolic rate with Houston screw music, but the albums chilly mood is closer to the heron-gray-skies gloom of RZA and Mobb Deep. In fact, when Mobb Deep affiliate the Alchemist shows up halfway through Habits on \"My Homie\", he feels right at home.\nHabits \u0026 Contradictions is, accordingly, a dark and moody listen, but it never bogs down in momentum or succumbs to despair. \"There He Go\" flips a sample of Portland trio Menomenas brittle \"Wet and Rusting\" into a hard-hitting anthem. \"Druggys Wit Hoes Again\", with its gabbling bursts of vocal samples and bone-jarring snare kicks, is a prime slab of Bay Area gangsta music. Even when everything slows to a crawl, there are small sounds tucked in everywhere, enlivening the darkness: the spaghetti-western guitar twangs on \"Sacrilegious\", or the heavy-breathing Portishead drum break of \"Raymond 1969\".\nIt helps that Schoolboy is an odd, genuinely unpredictable presence who sometimes seems to be rapping entirely for his own amusement. Theres audible dryness in his voice as he drunkenly croons the off-key hook, \"House fulla money/ Tub fulla bitches,\" on \"How We Feeling\", and you can hear hes holding the words in air quotes, as if hes just trying the words on, since theyre the Sorts of Things One Says in Rap Songs. On \"Nightmare on Fig St.\", he teases the opening \"Ball so hard\" bars of \"Niggas in Paris\" for no obvious reason, and then launches into sharply worded threats (\"The landlord, turn your lieutenant into a tenant\"), head-turning non sequiturs (\"We drive to pussy more than we do to church/ No AC but the heater WOOOORK!\") and a riot of demented ad-libs.\nThis lily-pad hopping means that it takes a while for the buried emotion in Habits to surface. Schoolboy raps in a wearily flat voice that evokes Prodigys, and his lyrics deal with all the dark stuff of gangsta rap: poverty, violence, drugs, hopelessness. But his music has none of gangsta raps implacable, survival-at-all-costs forward motion. Schoolboys music is dank with the lousy weather of disappointment, with human-sized failures. When he tells us about selling oxycontin with a lifelong friend who sold him out, he doesnt sound like murderous Vengeance Incarnate; he just sounds hurt. His tangled past as a set leader of the Hoover Crips, meanwhile, leaks out in small bits. \"Contradictions in my thoughts, and I just execute my feelings,\" he mutters on \"2 Raw\", and it hints effectively at an unspoken well of remorse.\nSchoolboy Q has little of Black Hippy alpha Kendrick Lamars gloomy-paladin aura, or his rap-Hamlet charisma. But its worth noting that, at least right now, Schoolboy is making stronger music than Kendrick. Habits \u0026 Contradictions sounds comfortable in its skin, at home its own quiet strangeness, in a way that Section.80 never manages. Its better-paced. Hes probably not going to be a break-out star, but its hard to imagine that there will be many more original or satisfying rap long-players this year.",

        "article_text": "Strange can exist anywhere, but we have a habit of thinking only the maximal and unhinged-- Captain Beefheart, Basement Jaxx, R. Kelly-- are truly weird. How bizarre can the music of Philip Glass or Wolfgang Voigt really be? It seems contained, planned; the curio is the choice to be so on-keel in the first place. One of my favorite aspects of Nicolas Jaars debut full-length, Space Is Only Noise, is how thoroughly it scatters this misconception. Space is leftfield electro-pop, far-flung and without reserve, but it is also patient, quiet, and small.\nJaar is a Providence via New York via Chile producer. He is 21, he attends Brown University, and he already has several well regarded singles and EPs to his name in addition to running the Clown \u0026 Sunset imprint. Requisite hot remixes: check. He exhibits all of the earmarks of a rising techno star: He remixes dance music, and his early singles were released as 12\"s on dance labels. He counts Chilean techno giant Ricardo Villalobos as a prime inspiration. Little with Jaar is straightforward, however. His father is an acclaimed visual artist. His mixes play like outsider pastiche. There are conflicting reports about whether his downtempo beats-- usually clocking between 90 - 110 bpm-- actually move dancefloors (Jaar himself is skeptical).\nHere is an alternate theory as to why Jaar occasionally fails to shuffle Nikes: He makes weird, self-contained music that only lands a glancing blow on house or any other particular dance subgenre. Jaars music incorporates lounge pop, African jazz, hip-hop, and sound collage in addition to house and pinches of dubstep. The type of soundsystem most appropriate for Space isnt a sleek club hi  -fi but a Victrola in a stop-motion film (\"steampunk house\"-- lets please not go there).\nThe textures and ingredients of Jaars music exist in the context of techno-- rhythm and repetition are clearly important to him-- but Space is not dance music. Its too slow, sure, but its also too diffuse in its methods and results. Pianos, organs, guitar strings, and, most surprisingly, Jaars voice all fall under Spaces sepia-toned veil. This sounds like a lot to take in, but Jaar goes to great lengths to ensure that Space settles lightly. The tracks are short, funny, and always hitched to a melody. He sidesteps impulses-- during the quivering \"Almost Fell\", for instance, or during \"Specters of the Future\", during which actual techno threatens-- to drift into full-on ambience, skronk, or extended beat passages. The goofy bass bumbling of \"Problems With the Sun\" is as likely to stick with you as the elegiac \"Colomb\". Functionally I keep thinking of my first listens to The Books Thought for Food: familiar styles and influences are wafted under my nose. There is a lot of teasing recognition but very little realization. The record passes easily and quickly.\nJust as Jaars treated instruments blur the line between digital and acoustic, his voice-- calm and husky, somewhat affected-- saddles up to the soul samples and film dialogue that pepper the album and confidently blends. He hums earworms-- \"Replace the word space with a drink and forget it\"; \"Too many kids finding rain in the dust\"-- that ripple across his productions. These voices-- Jaars own or samples-- are more than melodic placeholders. The gentle house balladry of \"I Got a Woman\" uses a looped Ray Charles refrain and French film dialogue to evoke something more specific than the electric pianos and breakbeat can. Jaar is akin to labelmates DJ Koze and Dave Aju, who weave voices among beats in counterintuitive ways.\nSpace never feels like a showcase for Nicolas Jaar; its just a modest and well-decorated gathering place for some things he loves, a place for them to interact. This teetering restraint masks the true weirdness of Space Is Only Noise. I could understand someone finding the intensely self-contained Space a bit claustrophobic, but the album is most rewarding when you just grab a seat at the table. Because when Jaar chants \"Grab a calculator and fix yourself\" I dont sit there and think, \"Gosh, why am I listening to electro-acoustic downtempo future-jazz?\"; I go look for my calculator.",

        "article_text": "Call it the Fickle Revolution. An increasing number of indie bands appear to be absorbing the channel-hopping, micro-editing, multitasking pace of our ADD generation, flitting amongst styles and sounds like a middle-schooler tries out different cultural identities. As opposed to the genre-casserole cookbooks that glutted the late 90s in the long shadow of one Beck Hansen, this trend seems to be more about keeping the peas, chicken alfredo, and biscuit strictly sequestered on different parts of the plate, while still packing them all into a single track. Borrowing the love of segues and multi-part suites from prog while leaving behind (most of) the muso wank, this branch of indie rock seems to be fighting its complacency with complexity, replacing calculated non-chalance with giddy ambition.\nLast years flag-wavers for this trend were the Fiery Furnaces, whose Blueberry Boat revived the untapped \"A Quick One While Hes Away\" story-song format for a surprisingly divisive audience. Though the Furnaces dont seem willing to relinquish their leadership role-- what with stacks of new material all set to be released in the coming year-- the hot prospect on the scene just might be Architecture in Helsinki, an eight-member Australian outfit bursting with the same ecstatic impatience and pretentious-pop charm. It pains my soul to so tightly tether a bands image to that of another, but AiH utilize a very similar approach to making music (if in tighter, briefer packages than the Furnaces), and will likely provoke reactions along the same love-it-or-loathe-it battle lines.\nWhere Architecture in Helsinki hold an advantage, however, is in sheer size, with eight members contributing on a Santa-long list of instruments, producing a sound like a third-grade music class let loose in a music instrument warehouse. Most of the bands members also contribute vocals to In Case We Die, creating a vocal spectrum to match the instrumental diversity: off-tune twee, standard-issue indie-boy/girl croon, congregational harmonies, all-male military choral chants. These elements give Architecture in Helsinki multiple palette combinations to try, and to their credit, In Case We Die tries as many as humanly possible in 12 tracks and 40 minutes.\nTake the title track, which (of course!) contains a parenthetical \"parts 1-4\" on the listing. Part 1 opens with electronic shimmers reminiscent of their smaller-canvas debut, Fingers Crossed, but surfeited with random percussion including rather Smile-esque saws and hammers. Shift suddenly to Part 2, where strings and horns flare briefly before giving way to a Stringman solo. Part 3 contains a rather Arcade Fire unison-chorus vocal, complete with field recordings of a fireworks show. And Part 4 eases us back down with a minute of indie slow-dance, complete with angelic backing singers and what sounds like a French horn solo. Oh, did I mention all this takes place in 3:33?\nArchitecture in Helsinkis unwillingness to decide what kind of band they are is their most endearing quality, forcing them through multiple metamorphoses within each song-- like \"The Fly\" in fast-forward. At the core, one could probably most easily pound them into the square hole of twee-pop, but I havent heard too many twee bands so convinced that they can pull off a spastic dance segment (\"Nevereverdid\"), or make a two-minute symphony about math (\"Its 5!\"), or effortlessly build a song from a simple electro beat to a brassy peak Beulah would be jealous of-- and, oh yeah, use some sitar and psychedelic a capella while theyre at it (\"Do the Whirlwind\"). What passes for straightforward, in songs like \"The Cemetery\" and \"Wishbone\" is still delivered at three-espresso pace, with enough mic-swapping and instrument-switching to make me imagine their live show looks like an Olympic event.\nOK, I could spend another 600 words just diagramming the various twists and turns within the shockingly short boundaries of In Case We Die, but its a lot better to listen than to read. All the same, dont be surprised if you experience a little dizziness, or a little frustration, as every catchy melody on this disc (and there are dozens) tends to arrive and depart faster than a subway train. Armed with more ideas than should probably be legal, Architecture in Helsinki cant be bothered to dwell for too long on any one of them, and its this fickle nature that will make you either adore them or deplore them.\n ",

        "article_text": "With the possible exception of a certain French house duo whose name we wont bring up quite just yet, its difficult to think of another dance act whose career ascent has been as storybook as Pascal Arbezs. After toiling for years in relative obscurity under the aliases Dima (as good as the name suggests) and Hustler Pornstar (uh, ditto), the Frenchman didnt just draw blood with Vitalics 2001 Poney EP, he lopped a few arteries. Seriously, its hard to overstate the response to Poney; of its four tracks, three became high-tide dancefloor staples. Along with the dark, yawning electro of \"Poney Part 1\" and \"Poney Part 2\", there was the centerpiece \"La Rock 01\", still the reigning champion of songs that sound like paper shredders orgying in a wind tunnel.\nWhile everyone from 2 Many DJs to Aphex Twin to Sven Väth was busy corking their sets with one (or two, or three...) tracks from Poney, Arbez was studiously lifting a few PR moves from his contemporaries, first by playing up his anonymity and later by concocting an elaborate backstory that involved a Ukrainian upbringing, animal fur trading, male prostitution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Despite being offered enough shows to keep him busy until the fall of the Wailing Wall, Arbez chose his live engagements carefully. He applied a similar selectivity to his output, issuing only a few 12\"s and a handful of choice remixes over the next few years.\nThat lull didnt do much to temper the weighty expectations placed on his full-length debut-- Lord knows, the Human After All-shaped hole in a lot of peoples springtime playlists probably didnt help either. Happily, I cant imagine anyone who cared for Vitalics earlier material being disappointed with OK Cowboy. Part of that is because Poney is built into this records DNA-- rather than feeling like cursory inclusions, the EPs big three tracks sit beautifully alongside Arbezs less dancefloor-friendly, album-oriented material. The result is a much more complete and crafted record than youd expect from an artist renowned for his killer singles.\nNot unlike LCD Soundsystems best maximalist moments, the bulk of OK Cowboys action happens in the mid and high registers. In the same way that most indie bands look to guitars to do the bulk of their storytelling, Arbez leans pretty compulsively on his synths-- that probably explains why so many have glommed onto words like \"metallic\" and \"rock\" to describe Vitalics sound.\nThe big new single here is \"My Friend Dario\", a jackhammering quiet-loud-quiet-loud guitar workout thing whose biggest fault is that it doesnt sound all that unlike Primal Screams turn of the decade guitar techno coke freakout schtick. While its a worthy enough addition as Vitalic burnburners go, its hardly a patch on \"No Fun\" and \"Newman\", both of which boast synth lines that start out as pneumatic wheezes and turn into floor-swallowing squelches.\nBut we already knew Arbez could do acid for the end of the world. Whats more surprising are his slower songs, the plaintive bits and bobs that comprise the albums glue. Equal parts jerky organ workouts (\"Wooo\"), spacey Baroquisms (\"The Past\"), and funhouse melodies (\"Polkamatic\"), these tracks sketch out the other side of a polarity (sweet, charming Gallicisms on one side, four-alarm fires on the other) that, when its all said and done, has us thinking about that one French duo again. Not because Vitalic is a second generation imitation (Daft Punk has always had more grease in their wheels), but because hes made a record thats in the same league as Homework or Discovery.\n ",

        "article_text": "As a teen, I worked in the music section at Borders constructing complex, unsanctioned Siltbreeze displays and replacing listening-station copies of John Teshs Sax on the Beach with Ornette Colemans Free Jazz or John Coltranes Stellar Regions. It was during one of these escapades that a manager approached me and pronounced Charles Mingus The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady \"too raucous,\" adding that he liked his jazz \"spry,\" before hiking his Dockers and trudging off to the New York Times Bestseller List section. I bring this up because jazz purists (and in this dudes case, \"pure\" = \"freshly fallen snow\") make even the most obnoxiously close-minded indie nerds look as chilled-out as opium-drugged Taoists. So, those of you who never graduated beyond \"hard bop\" would be doing yourselves a favor by turning back now. For anyone else:\nIn the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster is the third album (and first for Rune Grammofon) from Norway-based Shining, an experimental collective whose lineup includes two former members of Ninja Tunes electro-lite combo Jaga Jazzist: This album doesnt even remotely hint at that bands bland, ivory-tickling, snare-wrapping pedigree; Kingdom is labyrinthine, alternately creeping and brutally visceral, and certainly raucous.\nMaybe these sparkling, teetering, huge sounds reflect the coming-of-age of Shinings leader, multi-instrumentalist Jørgen Munkeby, who joined Jaga in 1996 when he was only 16. Tellingly, Munkeby grew up listening to Sepultura and Pantera before taking on the saxophone at the wee age of nine. Helping point Shining in other non-jazz (and non-metal) directions, bassist Aslak Hartberg is the mastermind behind Norways best-selling hip-hop collective, Klovner i Kamp. So what do we have here: Jazzy art rock? Proggy jazz? Who knows. On top of any number of brassy instruments, there are clattering drum machines, moaning synths, chameleonic samplers, swooning (and frequently buried) vocal harmonies, and thunderous, window-rattling cathedral organs.\nShining frontload the record with \"Goretex Weather Report\", an opener as mighty as anything Ive heard this year. It begins with sparse, muted saxophone exhalations, clean handclaps, and tentative, chugging ministrations before, after a minute or so, thundersticks connect with earthly skins and guitars picks off stars. Taciturn in comparison, \"REDRUM\" offers dueling horns over squiggles of drums, rat-a-tat rave-ups, and a sighing vocal clip. \"Romani\" goes for flute/clarinet, distant bass, some drums, and vibes/xylophone, and the instrumentation descends while airy, harmonizing vocals ascend. The track doesnt explore much distance, but it covers a lot of surface area.\nDespite its ostentatious, Dune-referencing title, \"31 = 300 = 20 (It Is By Will Alone I Set My Mind in Motion)\" is a whisper, as if the band were playing from behind a wall of Tony Conrad gauze. But after a few minutes of drifting, sighing, and softly imploding, Shining mash together AM-radio vocal bugs, some extinct countrys national anthem, and a feverish drum breakdown. Elsewhere, like wheedling new wave, \"The Smoking Dog\" kicks electro-drumpad Western tango and some (I kid you not) Bobby McFerrin-inspired scat, while the gonging and droning \"Magazine RWRK\" buzzes with atmospherics reminiscent of a plodding noise band jamming with a virtuoso French horn player.\nCheck it out: There, somewhere over the horizon, that guy in the Mr. Bungle shirt took silent note of a playful 7/8 atmospheric break and wept in double-time. Over there, some kid tired of improvising to Rush and the \"Benny Hill Theme\" just got his groove back. But, hey techy, before you pick up a stopwatch and dork out, note that Shining keep things brief, subtle, tight, and aesthetically on-the-mark, suggesting progness (or at least, jazz kids spreading their rock wings) is often less about duration and bombast than complexity, invention, and the rigorous interplay of its players.\n ",

        "article_text": "Fogs Minnesota drivers license is inscribed with the name his mama gave him (a comparably unromantic Andrew Broder), and the shrewdest Minneapolis hipsters might recognize him by his club moniker, the farcically straightforward DJ Andrew, but on Ether Teeth-- his second full-length-- he is, conveniently, all Fog. Broders latest alias is an appropriate metaphor for Ether Teeths eleven wispy, befuddling tracks: alternately gorgeous and jarring, soothing and repetitive, Ether Teeth is a hypnotic, moody collection of experimental guitar wails, lush piano, eclectic sampling, and ethereal, hissing blank space.\nBursting forth from the collage-driven DJ tradition (Prince Paul to Kid Koala), Fog is obviously well-versed in the process of snatching and reusing, infusing his tracks with occasionally ironic spots of found sound. The general problem with found stuff-- be it a Diana Ross backbeat or a canary-- is that the act of recognition is not an especially artful endeavor in and of itself. Recontextualization is hip-hops founding principle, but its a tenet based on the idea that sampling should involve skillful arranging and sequencing, not straight up cutting and pasting. Appropriation and transplanting requires ingenious tweaking in order to deserve a stamp of reinvention; to become the painting-- not just the wall its hanging on.\nFog, fortunately, realizes this-- his snagged material, which can consist of anything from film dialogue, to conversations, to fragments of old songs, to birds, birds, birds-- are placed over alarmingly beautiful, droning guitar chords and splatters of piano. Despite a couple of rough spots, Ether Teeth is largely composed of sublime moments in which the sound becomes part of the song, complimenting the melodies and functioning cohesively rather than extraneously. \"Plum Dumb\" is a heart-stopping, expertly assembled opener that layers rich guitar plucking over a Casio-looped classical drone and buzzing, almost-human turntable slips. A creepy choral refrain of \"which nobody can deny!\" eases in like a second melody; soon, a meandering piano line snakes through, building to a thunderous, overwhelming climax before easing back out and ending on a breathtaking choral sample, now louder, stranger, and throatier.\nThe foot-stomping \"What a Day Day\" is more straightforward: snarky, sarcastic and fueled by aggressive acoustic guitar, Fogs charmingly haphazard singing finds a contextual home here. After an unpredictable two minutes, it bursts into a chorus on par with the best melodramatic piano ballads from the 70s: \"If you need me, call my lawyer.\" Another archaic vocal sample pops up at the end, warning everyone to \"get out of Terrible Town\" and \"go on to Lovelyville.\"\n\"The Girl from the Gum Commercial\" opens with some nicely obnoxious open-mouthed gum mauling; these smacks sound oddly percussive against a rudimentary piano melody and quiet guitar strums, like sticky, high-pitched drums. Fogs voice sneaks around the tune, sometimes loud, sometimes inaudible, but the track vehemently refuses to follow any sort of logical, linear path. Its a dynamic trick: if youve got the patience to stick it out for five minutes, the alarming turntable debauchery halfway through should substantiate the investment for most.\nIts the winning (if anything-but-cheery) \"Cheerupcheerily\" where Fogs isolated misery is most dramatically defined. As an ambient swell-- almost certainly snatched from a U2 track, and quite possibly the instrumental \"Korova 1\"-- loops repeatedly, the song gradually builds into a clarinet-dotted wail of distortion so focused and thin, it threatens to tear a hole through your line of sight. Like cinemas recent Americana melodramas, its a meditation on ache and desire thats at once aware of its insignificance in the scope of things.\nEther Teeth sags briefly midway through-- \"No Boys Allowed\" and \"Apologizing to Mystery\" are both half-conceived-- but immediately after, the 11-minute \"Wallpaper Sink or Swim\" seems a clear and devestating revelation. After five minutes of its barely-there piano and jutting left-channel samples, a thundering melody harkens a new beginning, killing itself on an odd chord before rising again as a dramatic, ascending progression. Hushed jazz drums begin to stutter and fall all over the track as horns, tones and samples wander around Fogs constant chant, \"Goats will eat tins cans,\" an apparently meaningless repetition that has a surprising function: the lyric is the grounding melody around which an orchestra of instruments circle, a moment in which hip-hops tradition of juxtaposition meets music theory.\nFog lays down some skillful, ambitious, and certainly curious foundations on Ether Teeth, but his coloring book isnt completely filled in. But that hes made such a tremendous leap from his amateurish if promising debut to this highly developed, emotionally attenuated sound manipulation speaks to his future. For its sometimes uneven composition, Ether Teeth brings reality closer to your ears than most music ever hope, melding folk, hip-hop and psychedelia to produce a few of the finest tunes youll hear this year. Surprisingly personal and emotionally resonant, Ether Teeth is potent inspiration, undeniably captivating in its moments of brilliance.",

        "article_text": "In 1975, the Irish poet Seamus Heaney published a small collection of verse, aptly titled \"Bog Poems\". Heavily nuanced and intensely personal, the book carefully contemplates the bizarre recovery of 2000-year old human bodies-- preserved with horrifying perfection-- from Denmark's massive bogs. Unsurprisingly, Heaney had written about these bogs before, often cataloguing the stalled, ancient objects that had been dug up, wholly unchanged, from their weird, sludgy depths. San Diego's Castanets, whose non-CDR debut has just been released by the Asthmatic Kitty imprint, express a similar fascination with swamp-culture, and the contemporary repercussions of age-old traditions. Nodding briefly to Six Organs of Admittance and the No-Neck Blues Band, the band leers large at American country's longstanding definitions: For Castanets, country music should sound like death, and more specifically, death-by-murky-submersion. Frontman Raymond Raposa moos his deep gothic ballads like he's dog-paddling backwards through big Florida swamps, banging his knees on knobby cypress roots, ruffling pools of duckweed and featherfoil, desperately digging Spanish moss out from his nostrils, battling hard for buoyancy. The process is slow, the water explicitly thick and unapologetically sinister, easing a dim, wet descent into Earth's impenetrable goo. But the bits Raposa brings back-- quivering promises, deadpan defeats-- are, like Heaney's un-antiquated artifacts, startlingly real. With the help of his bandmates, Raposa's hollow, boxy vocals are set against spare funeral dirges (\"Cathedral 2\"), stompy guitar throwdowns (\"Industry and Snow\", the outstanding \"Three Days, Four Nights\"), and planes of free-folk ping (\"You Are the Blood\"). Still, Raposa's candlelit pipes are inevitably centered, shaking with loneliness and dread-- even guest vocalists Brigit DeCook and Liz Janes' murmurs and screams sound like they're coming from another room, their pale shouts muffled and heavy with desperation, chasing Raposa's grief. Raposa does manage to pack in a few chances for air: \"As You Do\" takes a more traditional stab at classic, Americana-fed melancholy, with warbling slide guitar, sweet acoustic strums, and gentle percussion. Consequently, \"As You Do\" transforms into a gentle, rolling lament, more wheat fields than swamp scum. Closer \"Cathedral 4 (The Unbreaking Branch and Song)\" is fed by a sparkling backbeat and cute guitar noodles-- clocking in at just under 2\\xBD minutes, it's a fleeting glimpse of solid land. Raposa is reportedly working on a novel that will expound on the themes of Cathedral, and such literary aspirations aren't particularly surprising, given then poetic weight of the record, which nobly grapples with issues of faith, death, splitting synapses, eating breakfast, spirits, and landscapes. And, like any good book, Cathedral the album is best suited to awkward late-night consumption, to be devoured while hiding under the sheets, clutching a flashlight, breathing heavy and deep.",

        "article_text": "Conceptually, Max Richters The Blue Notebooks-- German-born composer mixes contemporary classical compositions with electronic elements in a dreamscapy journalogue featuring excerpts from Kafkas The Blue Octavo Notebooks as narrated by Tilda Swinton-- reads like a relentlessly precious endeavor, as new age music for grad students, the sort of record that sagely pats you on the back for being smart enough to seek it out. And yet in practice, despite the fact that it is exactly as outlined above, Kafka quotes and all, there is absolutely nothing exclusive or contrived-feeling about it. In fact, not only is Richters second album one of the finest of the last six months, it is also one of the most affecting and universal contemporary classical records in recent memory.\nBut how to describe music that relies so completely on seeming familiar? Richter may fancy himself in a class with Philip Glass, Brian Eno and Steve Reich (indeed, his hyperattenuated sense of minimalism owes to all three), but unlike his influences, hes not remotely interested in subverting the traditional rules of composition. Short of one very beautiful moment that plunges an electronic sublow bassline into a deep sea of harpsichords and violas (see: the literally perfect \"Shadow Journal\"), there is nothing here to suggest that Richter is concerned with anything other than melody and economy. Its a formula he singlemindedly exploits with staggering effectiveness for the balance of the albums 40+ minutes.\nConstituted mainly of sparse pieces that lean on string quartets and pianos in equal measure, The Blue Notebooks is a case study in direct, minor-key melody. Each of the piano pieces \"Horizon Variations\", \"Vladimirs Blues\" and \"Written in the Sky\" establish strong melodic motifs in under two minutes, all the while resisting additional orchestration. Elsewhere, Richters string suites are similarly striking; \"On the Nature of Daylight\" coaxes a stunning rise out of gently provincial arrangements while the comparatively epic penultimate track \"The Trees\" boasts an extended introductory sequence for what is probably the albums closest brush with grandiosity. Richters slightly less traditional pieces also resound; both the underwater choral hymnal \"Iconography\" and the stately organ piece \"Organum\" echo the spiritual ambience that characterized his work for Future Sound of London.\nIf, however, there is one piece that fires The Blue Notebooks off into the stratosphere, its the aforementioned \"Shadow Journal\". Featuring a lone viola, some burbling electronics, a harpsichord and a subterranean bassline, it establishes a simple, keening melody and then gently pulls it wide, like warm string taffy, across its eight minutes. The fourth track on the record, it is nonetheless its centerpiece, and on a larger scale, possibly a gigantic beacon for composers searching for useful ways to introduce dance musics visceral, body-jarring qualities into the classical sphere.\nBut make no mistake, this is not Richters electronic/classical crossover, nor it is really his concept record. In fact, with songs that similarly forgo the temptations of complexity and choice so as to preserve their core ideas, its perhaps better thought of as his four-track demo, his lo-fi recording jaunt. Its Max Richter testing himself to see what he can produce under restraint. Turns out its more than he might have otherwise.",

        "article_text": "In a day where Hot Topic peddles guyliner to millions of male teenage mallrats, its hard to imagine a time when glam-rock was truly shocking. But there remains one gender-bending device whose provocative, polarizing power remains undiminished: the falsetto-- a sound that tends to elicit both laughter and skepticism, if not outright hostility. Still, it remains a highly effective weapon in the endless war against safe, overly earnest indie-- and few bands brandish it so wantonly as UK art-pop quartet Wild Beasts.\nOn the bands striking 2008 debut, Limbo, Panto, frontman Hayden Thorpe unleashed his shrill, glass-shattering shrieks as a means to project both the vulnerability and depravity of his sexually frustrated protagonists, and he didnt care if he went hoarse in the process (you can practically hear his vocal cords disintegrate on the galloping single \"Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants\"). Perhaps as a means to avoid chronic laryngitis, on follow-up Two Dancers hes deferring more frequently to bassist Tom Fleming, a deeper-voiced foil in the Nick Cave crooner mold. But thats just a surface indication of the transformation Wild Beasts have undergone in the past year-- in contrast to the first albums fidgety, impulsive baroquenroll, Two Dancers sees Wild Beasts refashioned as a steely art-funk outfit thats no less alluring in its austerity.\nGranted, some old horny habits die hard-- were not two verses into album opener \"The Fun Powder Plot\" before Thorpe hollers, \"This is a booty call! My boot, my boot, my boot, my boot up your asshole.\" But his words feel less outrageous and much more ominous when set against the songs metronomic groove and melancholic jangle-- pulse-tempering measures that keep the cheekiness in check. Likewise, first single \"Hooting and Howling\" benefits from a patient, linear build that transforms the song from a quiet trill into a heart-racing anthem, with Thorpes circular vocal and guitar lines burrowing the melody well into memory before the first chorus is out.\nFans of Limbo, Pantos chandelier-swinging flamboyance may be less enthused with Two Dancers more organized presentation, but it allows Wild Beasts to better achieve their singular balance of aristocracy and anarchy: the debonair funk of \"We Still Got the Taste Dancin on Our Tongues\" speaks of class warfare under the serious moonlight (\"Us kids are cold and cagey rattling around the town/ Scaring the oldies into their dressing gowns/ As the dribbling dogs howl\"), while the two-part title track suite finds Fleming sharing a grim, first-person account of some horrible attack before the song erupts in a tribal, psychedelic surge. He could very well be talking about a public stoning in the 15th century or a gang rape from last week-- and its not even entirely clear if hes singing from a male or female perspective-- but the lack of specificity makes the transgressions described all the more unsettling, as if they could happen to anyone.\nWild Beasts certainly arent the first rock band to stand up societys dregs and outcasts, but few others immortalize them on such a wondrous, mythic scale. And in the grand \"This Is Our Lot\"-- the sort of song everyone wants Radioheads perpetually imminent \"return to rock\" to sound like-- we quite literally have an anthem for the ages. Over top a rubbery bassline and shimmering guitar riff, Thorpe tips his tipple to the enduring passion of youth: \"We find ourselves dancing late/ Like young reprobates/ By the milky light of the mighty moon/ Find someone to nuzzle you/ And waltz from the room.\" Of course, come sunrise, those kids will have to clean themselves up and get to work on time. And perhaps the more accessible approach of Two Dancers suggests a greater willingness on Wild Beasts part to interact with the straight world. But for them, every night is still a full moon-- and when it comes, Thorpe will be ready to howl.",

        "article_text": "There arent many bands Ive listened to more than Crystal Antlers this year, but I still dont think theres an optimum way to hear them yet. If the buzz sends you to MySpace, youll get their impact but not their dynamics. Catch one of their cramped live shows and youll get their in-it-to-win-it intensity but not their expansiveness. Hear their self-released EP, and youre getting closer-- besides existing at the cross-section of so many styles, the disc finds the band at a more important nexus of potential and realization. In person, Crystal Antlers look like outcasts from six different bands, and at various points on this record, they sound like it, too: Merging psych, garage, lo-fi, prog, and countless other influences, the group easily maintains consistency despite a complete inability to be pinned to any specific movement or trend (so long as youre not counting the increasingly frustrating trend of unimaginative bandnames).\nYou might come across comparisons to Les Savy Fav, an appropriate call if you consider it shorthand for \"relentlessly energetic band with crowd-pleasing stage antics.\" EPs opener \"A Thousand Eyes\" is evidence enough of that: Beginning with doomy, lo-fi minor arpeggios, it soon explodes into a Latin-influenced rumble before the band piledrives into a swaggering psych hook, the track sounds something like if Comets on Fire inverted their ratio of chaos-to-craft. Beneath the squall, \"Vexation\"s headsnapping pace and flesh-searing bass riff could be a Stooges-style punk shoutalong. The organ riff that \"Owl\" pogos on is a found relic from late-1960s Venice Beach with a monolithic vocal melody. And like any long-haired throwback worth its bongos, EP ends with the loosest and longest number, the seven-minute swamp lurch of \"Parting Song for the Torn Sky\".\nAs much as it diverges from the brain-frying aim of typical psych-rock outings, EP is an unorthodox summer record-- not so much for driving to the beach as actually being in its sweltering grasp, equal parts scorched earth and wide open spaces. Credit to producer Ikey Owens (aka Mars Voltas keyboardist-- theres hope!) for finding enough room for every instrument, few of which act in their traditional scope. If you find yourself humming any of the riffs, odds are theyll come from singer Jonny Bell, who treats his bass like a six-string while guitar (check the appropriate titanic \"Arcturus\") and organ provide shading under an ozone of reverb that, like early My Morning Jacket, gives an impression of an expansive soundworld the band can grow into.\nIts tempting to be patient and call this disc a stopgap on the way to a triumphant debut full-length. But EP is plenty substantial as is; at 25 minutes, its only a few shy of Nouns or, more to the point, any number of psych-rock classics from decades past. Of course, if youre still waiting on further evidence of how much there is to like about these guys, consider that I waited until the end of this review to mention that their percussionist is named Sexual Chocolate.",

        "article_text": "Wavves is the one-man noise-pop project of 22-year-old San Diegan Nathan Williams. Since his homemade cassettes and mpfree turbulence started damaging ears last year, Williams has become the focal point of what reads and feels like a maelstrom of chatter. Once something of a left-field mystery, the hype around him has built steadily throughout this young year. Now with drummer and a press photo, Williams has probably played about as many shows as he has songs to be heard. A spate of recent outings in New York a few weeks back had the scene in such a tizzy,  The   New York Times  sent a dispatch to bear witness. And, just a few days later, to capitalize on the swell, his new label expedited the digital release of  Wavvves  , his second full-length in just four months.   Without delving too deeply into the muck of Williams proper (and purely self-titled) debut LP,  Wavves  , its worth noting that each of his twin long-players share more than just a menu of goths, weeeeeeed, demons, breakers, and vintage skate photography. While his second is the marginally less abrasive, more realized of the two efforts, both feature the same roach-encrusted punk pop. Be it in the opening power chords of \"Beach Demon\" or \"To the Dregs\", theres a couple of fried amps worth of trusted guitar tropes and distortion-- tricks borrowed from the Wipers and Sonic Youth-- enveloping Williams carbonated choruses. The vocal hooks themselves come fast, usually propelled by titanic drumbeats nicked from 1960s girl group music. Its not immediate--- and hardly the \"pop\" record that some have characterized it as-- but deep in the froth of highlight \"No Hope Kids\" lurks more than just a thick dose of teenaged ennui or even volume. Theres thrilling evidence of compelling, thoughtful craftsmanship as well.   Wavves no-fi bent has been compared to No Ages. But while those guys tend to reach far outside of their own feedback for spaces more expansive, Wavves music feels more insular, self-contained, and unsettling. These arent shouts from a house party, but from a solitary bedroom. And  Wavvves   outbursts are often tempered and sandwiched between clipped electronics (opener \"Rainbow Everywhere\" and \"Goth Girls\") or experimental noise (\"Killer Punx, Scary Demons\") that help congeal the album as a whole.   As the hubbub surrounding his music and name game began to gather serious cybersteam over the past few months, the San Diego native wisely moved his signature from small-time imprint De Stijl, to the bigger, much more historically distinct Fat Possum. Business measures and consonant gimmicks aside, the hop down South makes perfect aesthetic sense-- this young man is most certainly singing the blues. Hopeless stoner/loner incantations are scattered throughout, though two of the albums most bulletproof moments are also its most deliciously bleak. Next to the pains of \"No Hope Kids\" (no car, no friends, no family, no friends, no girl), \"So Bored\" leaves memorable blisters. Its the records one slam-dunk earworm, and its a total bummer. Over three melted chords and his own back-up ooooooohs and aaaaaahs, Williams moans a mantra thats bled into every track: \"Im sooooo booooored, Im sooooo boooored.\" Not for much longer.",

        "article_text": "These days I tend not to \"root\" for many musicians, to pledge loyalty to an artist I loved when we both were young, or circle album release dates or try to anticipate when a record will leak. More often than not, I instead brace myself for disappointment-- even from those whose work I most cherish. Its a pessimistic and potentially sad approach, but one that unfortunately seems to cushion blows more often than result in pleasant surprises. With the debut full-length from Junior Boys, I let my guard down. After two EPs of glacial, silken electro-pop (2003s Birthday and this years High Come Down), I just flat-out wanted more. Thankfully, I got it. Last Exit may be my anti-A Grand Dont Come for Free-- a little album I waited for with open arms rather than gritted teeth-- but its heights eclipse virtually all other music Ive heard this year.\nThe (to date) quiet rise of the Junior Boys is well-documented in the virtual world of the blogosphere, which for the most part has gone totally bonkers for the Ontario trio. Over the past year, the rapturous praise has been so constant that listing off the bands generous number of touchstones has practically become sport. Tellingly, though, for every time someone says Junior Boys sound like Timbaland goes for New Pop, an amorous two-step trying to coax indie-pop onto the dancefloor, or David Sylvian rummaging through Martin Frys wardrobe and Basic Channels outtakes, that person is only telling a part of the tale. More often than not, Junior Boys capture the mood and feel of many of these artists rather than ape their sounds. In fact, each of this records 10 deceptively simple and very approachable tracks carry the distinct fingerprints of lead songwriter and singer Jeremy Greenspan, who manages to fold elements of nearly a quarter-century of forward-looking pop into a distinct sound without sounding either conceptual or trading on contradictions or the smoke-and-mirrors of attention-grabbing eclecticism.\nFour of the albums tracks-- \"Birthday\", \"Last Exit\", \"High Come Down\", and \"Under the Sun\"-- were first released on last years EPs and sit nicely alongside the new songs. Thankfully, Junior Boys are neither shying away from what they do best because of the success of those singles, nor failing in an attempt to reach those same heights. Among the new songs, \"Teach Me How to Fight\" is anthemic Sophistipop, a shrinking violet rallying cry; the nocturnal orchestral maneuvers of \"Three Words\" delicately flicker beneath \"Neon Lights\"; and \"Bellona\" flutters and clicks as Greenspan laments long days and lost opportunities.\nSo, yes, despite the high dance IQ and its luxuriously monochromatic sensuality, the record does seem very... indie. On \"Teach Me\", Greenspan is requesting to \"show me what its like to give back pain,\" as his paper-thin voice projects honesty, vulnerability and the puppy-dog loyalty of sentimental, pale-skinned boys. So thankfully thats the fey, Anglocentric early 80s sense of the phrase \"indie,\" then, albeit dressed up with graceful, hopeful romanticism rather than self-deprecating fatalism. At times, that sense of hope seems buried under throbbing beats or kept at arms length by cold, pristine sonics, but dip your toes beneath that sleek surface and youll find an album of great warmth, beauty and even soul.",

        "article_text": "The first thing to know about Greetings from Michigan, the third album from Brooklyn-based singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens, is that its creator was born there. Few albums more clearly evoke their namesake: Towering pines, highways paved through granite walls, great lakes and deep valleys resonate in its gentle piano, muted trumpets, and close-micd production-- which is particularly odd, given that Stevens home city is Detroit. It leads you to wonder how one could craft an album so delicate from an inspiration its author calls a \"monstrous concrete prison\" which has been \"destroyed by its infidelity.\" Certainly, the album is run through with a wistful melancholia, with lyrics that reference the citys dead machinery and empty warehouses. But theres a reason the albums title greets its listeners from the state and not the city: The record is a beautiful, sprawling homage to the self-described pleasant peninsula.\nFittingly, Stevens opens the record on a pensive note: \"Flint (For the Unemployed and Underpaid)\" is a lulling, depressive hymn comprised of dew-drop piano and a shimmering backgrounded trumpet. Like Roger \u0026 Me, the song focuses on the titular citys impaired economy and empty rust-belt factories, albeit with a more bathetic and singular approach than the everyman journalism of Michael Moore: Stevens softly sings, \"Since the first of June/ Lost my job and lost my room/ I pretend to try/ Even if I try alone.\"\n\"All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace!\" follows, offering the first of only a handful of upbeat tunes. Here, the pace shifts to a sound more informed by the metropolis at the opposite corner of Lake Michigan, echoing the tight, sophisticated arrangements of Chicagos post-rock scene. The lengthier \"Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!)\" follows suit, also invoking a vaguely Sea and Cake-inspired background over which Stevens layers an extensive list of shoutouts to Michigan cities, as well as a warped guitar solo and nice tempo implosions.\n\"For the Widows in Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti\" is a banjo-led boy/girl bluegrass spiritual, dour but uplifted by the kind of sighing instrumentation Jim ORourke made his name on, while the strumming of \"Romulus\" evokes the fragile folk of Erics Trip and Nick Drake. Here, Stevens pen most achingly depicts the everyday sadness of muted familial disruptions. The songs narrator remembers his mother distantly: \"Our grandpa died in a hospital gown/ She didnt seem to care/ She smoked in her room and colored her hair/ I was ashamed of her.\"\nEqually beautiful are the sporadically placed instrumentals. If Philip Glass wrote pop songs, they might sound something like these, as Stevens often uses Glass-like patterns as the foundation for his lushly produced, moody indie pop. \"Tahquamenon Falls\" is what I took to be a glockenspiel clocked with a number of mallets and buried within a diaphanous echo of reverb; it varies and shifts slightly for over two minutes before trailing off upward. \"Alanson, Crooked River\" is similar in tone, perhaps using ice cubes or the rims of wine glasses as instrumentation. The mostly instrumental \"Redford (For Yia-Yia \u0026 Pappou)\" is a gently repetitious piano piece with whispered notes at the end: The human voices that resound here do so as isolated elements of a winter breeze, not as fully articulated words or thoughts.\nIf Stevens can be at all faulted on Michigan, its for erring on the side of indulgence, with the occasional track running too long. \"Oh God, Where Are You Now? (In Pickeral Lake? Pigeon? Marquette? Mackinaw?)\" drags somewhat over its nine-minute runtime, though to be fair, it does bloom icily towards the end. Its sleety water crystal feel reminded me of the almost anonymous hoarfrost of mid-period, pre-Kinks-fixated Lilys and the vastly underrated work of the 90s D.C. indie pop band Eggs. On the ebullient eight-minute \"Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head!\", the repetition works: Nowhere else on the album is the Philip Glass influence quite so notable, as its note patterns occur and recur, adding layers and resonance through chance sonic meetings.\nOn \"The Upper Peninsula\", Stevens harmonizes with The Danielson Familes Megan and Elin Smith: \"I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes.../ Ive seen my wife at the K-mart/ In strange ideas, we live apart.\" Its this kind of sad observation of the lives of the working class that repeatedly moved me on this album, as Stevens offers both realism and idealization in his portrait. The record is stacked with impressive space for Stevens shimmering geography, and it manages a melancholy beauty; Michigan is a frost-bound tone poem in which average people live out their victories and defeats with a shadowy, dignified grace.",

        "article_text": "Im not a spiritual person, nor am I easily moved by musical sentiment; a sort of innately critical shell forces me to appreciate sincere artistic outpourings from a distance in order to more fully examine them. Critics have to understand and express with seemingly imagined words like \"luminous\" what listeners will often simply feel in terms more like \"awesome.\" Were not immune to the \"awesome\" bug, though, and we still discover certain records that not only disarm our battery of well-honed defenses, but raze them to the ground. For TV on the Radio, all it took was Tunde Adebimpes sterling, gospel-blues croon, a solitary voice multi-tracked into a gorgeous three-part harmony containing multitudes: \"Hear me hailing from inside and realize/ I am the conscience clear.\" A rapid, mechanized pulse of clicks lend insistence to his suggestion that time is short: \"We were all weaned, my dear/ Upon the same fatigue.\"\nA massive confluence of factors-- masterful levels, nearly too-crisp production, and David Andrew and Jason Siteks beautifully translucent arrangements-- conspire to allow Adebimpes vocals to shine, diffuse and radiant, as the stunning centerpiece of every track on Young Liars. Bands have played up singers in the past, but here, the single-minded focus of every musical element seems designed purely to elevate the vocal melodies out of the realm of the merely \"real\" and into the hyper-real. Its the spirituality and soul of the blues filtered through barbershop harmonies, but accompanied in counterpoint by dehumanized pulses and drones. Without hyperbole, the effect is electrifyingly direct, nearly mesmerizing, and nothing quite like anything else I can recall.\nAdebimpe and the Siteks are currently only playing AAA ball in the New York PR farm system, but in preparation for their call-up to the Big Show, it doesnt hurt that theyve befriended the three-, four- and five-hitters in the Brooklyn All-Stars line-up: Aaron Hemphill (Liars), Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), and Brian Chase (also Yeahs). The guests make their presence known in subtle but unmistakable ways. Zinners trademark, tremulant surf-waves are the vital undercurrent of \"Staring at the Sun\", while his low-register distortions lay the foundation of \"Blind\" in drugged-out slow motion-- atop Chases loping mechanics, he creates a grim, plodding backdrop in stark contrast to the chorus heavenly reprises, compellingly tarnishing the optimism of the gorgeous vocals with just a hint of uncertainty. Adebimpe is plaintive and almost impossibly haunting here, but the jagged tears of Hemphills guitar, distant enough to sound two studios away, sends the song blissfully over the edge.\nOn this disc, in which every song bears the weighty finality to close, TV on the Radio provide a surreal bonus track: an a cappella cover of the Pixies \"Mr. Grieves\". Like a streetcorner serenade, its got all the ooohs, aaahs, handclaps and snaps of classic doo-wop, and yet it somehow remains brilliantly, unwaveringly faithful to the original. As the song spins out its last few seconds, Young Liars ends just as it starts, with such an immediately affecting resonance for which words seem almost unfair, if only because the time needed to consciously process them seems a frustrating juxtaposition to the spontaneity of the connection to something so unique. With this kind of sound, its telling that TV on the Radio finish by covering one of the most idolized bands in independent music; its a bold calling card for their upcoming full-length.",

        "article_text": "WU LYF are for the children. Thus far, World Unite Lucifer Youth Foundation have taken equal inspiration from A Clockwork Orange and fellow Mancunians Happy Mondays to play out that adolescent fantasy of having every bird-flip rewarded by authority figures theyre meant to offend. The British rags will help you fill in the rest, but here are a few talking points: getting a cold call from Michel Gondry only to ignore it; charging desperate A\u0026Rs 50 pounds for a demo; telling the UK press to fuck off, only to have them respond with statements like, \"theyre reinventing the wheel.\" Their web presence is so cryptic, they make Dead Air Space look like Lil Bs Twitter feed. The bands incomprehensible frontman, Ellery Roberts, is an experiment in rock vocal abstraction, and yet sold-out crowds sing along to every proto-linguistic grunt. But the centerpiece of Go Tell Fire to the Mountain-- a stunning lockstep of drum rolls, tart guitar chords, and a maddening chant for raising beers and clenched fists-- makes it clear: This is life-affirming music, repulsed by hype and cynicism. The name of the song? \"We Bros\".\nThe first word of the title is the important thing: Go Tell Fire celebrates togetherness. Approach the record with no context whatsoever, and its fairly trad indie rock for crescendo junkies that could be laid over just about anything-- a stirring football highlight, your morning commute-- for instant widescreen effect. Dissatisfied with the sound they were getting in traditional studios, WU LYF self-produced in an abandoned church, which could once again be sniffed at as another publicity stunt. But they needed every bit of open airspace to capture their sound in full, and the building itself acts as an active participant. Silvery, melodic guitar lines are given extra dimension with decay and release, and a pipe organ draws lengthy sustain. And man, what it does for the percussion: the term \"crash cymbal\" has rarely sounded so literal, and a critical mass of reverb pushes the kick drums natural tone to its limit on \"Dirt\" and \"14 Crowns For Me \u0026 Your Friends\".\nBut underneath all that bouncing room echo, you hear a band trying to live up to its own hype, unglamorously woodshedding until every arrangement was tight as hell. Its danceable in the same way older Modest Mouse is-- a sweet spot that feels more limber than rock and too jittery to congeal into a groove like funk, but always in the service of some sort of physicality. Even the ballads rarely feel settled: The opening piano chords of \"Concrete Gold\" echo around a kick drum beat, before a call-and-response chorus that evokes the melodicism of D.C. hardcore.\nSo while musically it connects the divergent anthem-fashioning of  Explosions in the Sky or Wolf Parade, Roberts vocals evade just about any facile comparison. Attempts to classify it have ranged from Captain Beefheart to a variety of feral animals or malfunctioning household appliances, all making the same point, more or less: this is a trial by fire. Hes screaming \"I love you forever!\" on the first track (\"L Y F\") while revealing an alternate translation for their band name, yet in the urgency of Roberts voice, you can see the matted fur and gnarled teeth of an endearingly ugly stray that youre still hesitant to love back (see also: his performance on the aptly titled military funeral march \"Such a Sad Puppy Dog\").\nAnd yet, similar to the way Jónsi applied the rhythms and phonetics of Hopelandic to convey an immutable, beatific divinity, Roberts lives within WU LYFs musical viscera as a vocal embodiment of animal instinct, projecting from the primitive part of the brain that can sense danger and react before it even acknowledges the source. You can occasionally make out his marching orders on \"Cave Song\" and \"Dirt\", but Roberts and WU LYF match up spasm for spasm to make their point clear: keep your head on a swivel, move. Do something. WU LYF bark out the title of \"Spitting Blood\" repeatedly over heraldic organ, and its an evocative image leaving its completion up to the listener. On the chorus, Ellerby and crew yell \"we are so happy! Happy to see...,\" the intelligibility fittingly cutting off right there. After all, what is the phrase Go Tell Fire to the Mountain besides an open-ended call to arms?\nCloser \"Heavy Pop\" might be the only time WU LYF actively and clearly suggest what theyre getting at (indeed, a dispatch on the bands mailing list describes the album as \"10 tracks of true heavy pop\"). But Go Tell Fire rarely scans as \"pop music,\" and at times, its content to give into pure texture and drift. Rather, this \"heavy pop\" translates to me as populism of real heft. More artistically rewarding records have been made this year, but when I think about WU LYF in the manner of Iceage or Odd Future as musicians that have made me genuinely excited about their potential impact on listeners, the same things that make them seem juvenile-- the artistic and personal volatility, the semblance of a roving gang more than a band, the invitation to indulge in your most disturbing impulses and yet feel morally superior to an ill-defined majority-- are the same things that feel totally galvanizing. And its easy to imagine Go Tell Fire to the Mountain giving disaffected listeners the promise of an entry to something beyond themselves in a way that James Blake or Bon Iver cant. Maybe youve grown past that sort of thing, but what about a record of exhilarating expanse and passion that sounds like indie rock and yet feels way bigger? Well, Go Tell Fire to the Mountain is that too.",

        "article_text": "The breakup album is a familiar pop music trope-- countless artists have harnessed the emotional fallout of a relationship to fuel their songwriting efforts. The less imaginative practitioners wind up churning out acoustic self-pity or overdriven spite and angst, while the most effective have draped heartbreak in a clever disguise (like the high-gloss domestic dispute of Fleetwood Macs Rumours), or rendered personal pain as the most important event in human history (like the symphonic catharsis of ABCs The Lexicon of Love).\nDespite a soft spot for concept albums, Of Montreal would seem an unlikely participant in this arena, having spent much of their career eschewing confessional introspection for escapist fantasy. Even amidst the notebook-doodle psychedelia society of Elephant 6, Kevin Barnes and his compatriots stood apart for their day-glo Nickelodeon world, full of bizarre characters with alliterative names and toy-box, sugar-high arrangements. While theres always been a dark streak running through Of Montreals cartoon universe-- and Barnes chipmunk-shrill voice sometimes tips disturbingly from childlike to desperate-- few would look to the Athens, Geo., band to accurately depict loves gory aftermath.\nYet in the past year, storm clouds have intruded upon the bands rainbow domain as Barnes went through a separation (he and his wife have since reconciled); concurrently, the bands sound has been slowly molting off the giddy pop of its early days, using its past couple of albums to test the waters of a more sinister combination of synth-pop and glam without abandoning its steakhouse jingle-worthy melodies. These two plot threads intertwine at Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, an astonishingly good late-period record from Of Montreal thats as uncomfortably savage in its depiction of breakup psychology as it is relentlessly catchy.\nThe emotional accuracy of the record lies in Of Montreals unwillingness, or perhaps inability, to settle for \"woe is me\" moping. Barnes resists the urge to cry into an acoustic guitar, instead portraying the full-spectrum manic mood-swings of the brokenhearted: desperately seeking distraction in drugs or religion, imagining himself as a cynical-minded lothario, and even considering violence. When Barnes does directly give in to his despair, it produces the monolithic 12-minute centerpiece of \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal\", a gutwrenching soundtrack provided by an unrelenting bassline and a synth solo that sounds like an angry flying saucer.\nThe rest of Hissing Fauna is an endless supply of off-kilter but instantly appealing melodies intact over the bands newly robotic sound. The focus throughout is on mechanized rhythms and synthesizer swirls, though the tempos are no less hyperactive, and the attention span of the arrangements is only a shade longer. Occasionally, the bright synthesizers appear to mock Barnes shadowy feelings, like the roller-skate organ riff that flits about the pleading drug-use of \"Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse\", or the Christmas carol exterior of depression saga \"A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger\".\nOf Montreals full embrace of this new sound works best in the records second half, as after the soul-purge of \"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal\", Barnes tries to slut away the pain through a series of sex jams no less memorable for being completely unconvincing. \"Bunny Aint No Kind of Rider\" finds the singer sauntering through the club brushing off sexual advances from both women and men and boasting of \"soul power,\" while \"Faberge Falls for Shuggie\" struts over a bassline funkier than I ever could have imagined the group capable of producing. Throughout, Barnes multi-tracks several lascivious voices, making bizarre double entendres out of parachutes and interiors. Its not the direction many of their fans mightve imagined theyd take, but its that very attribute that makes it so ceaselessly fascinating and inexhaustibly replayable.",

        "article_text": "Marc Bolan may be dead, but Battles can rebuild him. They have the technology. On \"Atlas\", the second track on the bands debut album, drummer John Staniers pistons pump out a steroidal version of Bolans trademark shuffling stomp-beat. His three bandmates-- Ian Williams, Dave Konopka, and Tyondai Braxton-- constrict their two-note keyboards and one-note guitars until the song coalesces into a stiff, slick, swinging robot rock. Its like a skills-exchange workshop where mechanically minded krautrockers are encouraged to share their knowledge with remedial class glam bands only interested in big beat thrills. And as the almost-club-friendly single, its the perfect introduction to the rest of Mirrored, easing you into the albums mix of over-the-top whimsy, extreme analogue rhythms that are often as much jazz-fusion as IDM as tech-metal, vocals that would do Roger Troutman proud, and vise-tight, \"live or laptop?\" musicianship connected as much by USB ports and Firewire cables as the improvisatory interplay of four dudes just jamming.\nIn fact, Battles may be the first band to really play with the way that 21st century software can extend and distend the sound of a rock band in real time; Mirrored moves in ways that Battles first two instrumental EPs--post-rock played with the locked-down seriousness of modern techno--only suggested. Early Battles shows could sound like a metal band performing Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians, and Mirrored spurns solos, favoring a caffeinated maximalism where compositions are built out of 100 microscopic parts. The guitarist/keyboardists string together tracks out of riffs that crisscross with the careful preplanning of a subway system. Each instrument on opening track \"Race In\"-- Staniers military-precise massed snares, the guitars tensely climbing up and down a few notes, what sound like synthetic tubular bells-- is added with the deliberate patience of a Terry Riley composition. The song feels nervously repetitive, like its suffering from OCD.\nIf youve seen Battles live, youve probably seen the phrase \"ex-members of\" written on the flyer, and so maybe none of this surprises you. Save Stanier, everyone in Battles is a multi-instrumentalist, playing a prog albums worth of guitars, electronics, and/or keyboards. Braxtons put in time splitting the difference between IDM and avant-garde electronics; Konopka played with underrated indie instrumentalists Lynx, Stanier drummed for scholastic-metal pioneers Helmet; Williams finger-tapped for Don Caballero. But while theres certainly more than a shade of math rocks intricacy on Mirrored, tracks like the terse, tambourine-rattling quasi-funk of \"Tonto\" or Staniers time-signature and tempo fuckery on the crescendo-crazed \"Tij\", the stern stuff is continually undercut by a vibe thats more romper room than po-faced. The \"hook\" on \"Race In\" is a whistle-while-you-work chant that theyre probably humming down at Fraggle Rock. The astounding \"Rainbow\" spins into dizzying Rube Goldberg corkscrews of keyboard, xylophone, and giddily speed-attenuated symphonic metal drums. It sounds like the band is trying to recreate the Looney Tunes cartoon where Bugs and Daffy are dueling orchestra conductors, each driving their ensembles to crazier and crazier call-and-response peaks.\nAnd what makes Mirroreds merry melodies really stand out isnt the crazy quilt structures or needlepoint precision of the playing. Its the frenzied gibberish of Braxtons pitch-shifted and electronically processed vocals-- a kind of ecstatic robot thats speaking in cartoon tongues. When \"Atlas\" dropped a few months back, those vocals were a squeaky line in the sand for old fans, and across the internet, everyone had the same thought: \"Why are Battles suddenly aping the Animal Collective?\" But Avey Tare and company hardly invented high-pitched sing-song vocals-- just ask David Seville. On \"Leyendecker\", Braxton croons in a falsetto thats been whipped up by technology until it sounds like a neutered DAngelo. Combined with the music, a low-res quasi-R\u0026B beat as grainy as a glitch track, Braxtons circuitry pushes \"Leyendecker\" into far stranger places than any the Collective has wandered into. Throughout Mirrored he shreds his vocals with the post-human glee of Warp labelmate Jackson and His Computer Band, whether its the joyful opening burst of voice on \"Ddiamondd\" that spits pitch-bent consonants, or \"Tij\", where Braxton pants and wheezes in a creeped-out asthmatic lower-register. You couldnt even approximate \"Leyendecker\", or any of Mirroreds 11 tracks, with just acoustic guitars and voices.\nAt the same time, listen closely to the intro to \"Atlas\" and youll hear the pedal on Staniers kit hitting the kickdrum in the physical world of the studio, pushing air as the hammer connects with the skin. Even when reminiscent of the unfeasible programming of post-drillnbass electronica, Battles spastic drums are being played in real time, with the brute force and metronome-focus of a guy with a background in heavy rock. But its avant-pop hooks and ultrabrite melodies are being dissembled and reassembled by pitiless CPUs in equally real time. Its thrilling and disorienting because the virtuosity of both man and machine means that, unlike earlier rock/techno hybrids hampered by both technically unskilled players and crude technology, Battles sound is indivisible. Battles may not be the worlds first bionic rock group, but theyve done more to extend the idea of a flesh-and-blood band enhanced by computer technology than anyone since the late, lamented Disco Inferno. Mirrored is a breathtaking aesthetic left-turn that sounds less like rock circa 2007 than rock circa 2097, a world where Marshall stacks and micro-processing go hand in hand.",

        "article_text": "Deafheaven werent always this good. The San Francisco bands early shows found a scrappy, ambitious bunch of punk kids trying to warp black metal with shoegaze in a way that, for all its advances, felt familiar. In late 2010, they signed to Deathwish, the label run by Converges Jacob Bannon, and there were expectations in the underground. (Though, at that time, people seemed to focus more on the fact that they didnt look like a metal band than what they were creating.) When vocalist George Clarke and songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy released their debut LP, Roads to Judah, in 2011, they added wrinkles to that live sound, especially on the opening track, \"Violet\". The collection didnt always match those standards. It sometimes felt muddled, like they were trying to squeeze too much into the frame.\nBut that gorgeous 12-minute set-piece established the template and scope for the bands excellent sophomore album, Sunbather, a record that finds Deafheaven living up to and then surpassing expectations. Basically, theyve learned how to take the sounds theyve dreamed up out of their heads so we can hear them, too. If you go back and listen to Roads, youll find the elements that appear on Sunbather with 10 times the intensity. So while the approach here  isnt a surprise, the force with which Deafheaven pulls it off is a revelation.\nSunbathers a seven-song collection that fuses into a massive 60-minute piece. The sequencing, moving from brightness to darkness and back, is brilliant. Throughout, McCoy gives in to his inner Johnny Marr, offering deeper, prettier, more eclectic guitar tones. His lines are smeary with tremolo and delay, and the band seamlessly incorporates melancholic piano, harsh Godflesh-style noise bursts, spoken word, lush acoustic strums, and eerie samples. That, and new drummer Daniel Tracy plays big, adding a wallop theyve missed in the past. (Deafheaven have always been Clarke and McCoy with a shifting lineup around them; lets hope this one lasts.)\nThis is music that inspires the kind of wide-screen feelings people look for in Sigur Rós, Mogwai (who Deafheaven have covered), or Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Words of anger and frustration collide with the sheer beauty of the music. The power of that blend-- raw black metal and hardcore basking in pastel-colored post-rock guitars-- is something you dont experience in those other groups. There are plaintive moments here, but this is largely music about romantic lust, anger, and disappointment delivered by a band who know their punk and hardcore as well as their metal. They know their Cure and the Smiths, too. Remember the ecstatic closing moments of Fuck Buttons \"Sweet Love for Planet Earth\"? Loop that and ask Explosions in the Sky to play the accompanying music and youre tapping into this sound.\nWhile Deafheaven push this epic music as far as it can go, they retain a central emotional core, and are always in control compositionally. The opening song, \"Dream House\", is over nine minutes long; the closer, \"The Pecan Tree\", which moves from dire black metal to triumphant post-rock without any stitches showing, is closer to 12. The four longer songs dont repeat themselves; each is stunning in its constant motion and variation. \"Sunbather\" is bleaker than \"Dream House\", for instance, and on \"Vertigo\", they downshift from gossamer prettiness to full-on heavy with a warped My Bloody Valentine transition followed by their most power metal guitar soloing to date. At the five-minute mark of that song, blast beats enter and it goes black metal. Two minutes later, though, its soaring again with hook-laden guitars and floor-punching dynamics.\nEven the interstitial parts inspire. \"Dream House\"s delicate closing arpeggios blend with \"Irresistible\",  a three-minute swatch of melancholic guitar and piano that works as a gentle pause before the massive \"Sunbather\", but is in of itself a gorgeous composition. The grinding industrial noise at the end of \"Sunbather\" dissolves into \"Please Remember\", a relatively brief piece that features Alcests Neige speaking lines from Milan Kunderas novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. (Clarke explained its inclusion in a recent Show No Mercy: \"That passage is really important to me. It just screams insecurity, which I have huge faults with.\") \nClarkes voice mixed with the mountains of cascading guitars and drum crescendos is so strong that you dont need to know what hes saying to feel the effect of the music. But if you do decide to read the lyrics, you wont be disappointed: Sunbather was in part inspired by the singer growing up with his mother and brother without any money and wondering what itd be like to have it. Theres also his realization that, like his largely absent father, hes able to be cold emotionally, and not necessary able to love. The albums central image is of a girl sunbathing outside of her upscale house. Clarke spotted her after moving back home for a bit and while stuck in an existential crisis. He wondered what hed end up doing himself and, more so, what it would be like to have that girls existence. And, of course, what it would be like to have that girl. \"Dream House\" ends with a dialogue Clarke says he pieced together from drunken texts between him and a woman he was crazy about: \"Im dying./ Is it blissful?/ Its like a dream./ I want to dream.\"\nWith Sunbather, Deafheaven have made one of the biggest albums of the year, one that impresses you with its scale, the way Swans The Seer did last year. Like M. Giras masterpiece, it has the ability to capture the attention of people who dont normally listen to heavy music. Its also one of the most successful examples of a band using black metal as a starting point and ending up somewhere else entirely. People cite the short-lived San Francisco band Weaklings seminal 2000 album Dead as Dreams as the pinnacle of American black metal; Sunbather is another. Like Weakling, Deafheaven have changed things with this record-- black metal wont be the same now that its been released. Of course, folks will argue over just how black metal-- or even metal-- Sunbather is, and will discuss the \"un-metal\" pink cover art and the fact that Clarke could probably be a J. Crew model. These kinds of arguments are irrelevant. Instead, try focusing on how much better Sunbather is than any other black metal album released this year, and how its, by far, one of the best in any genre. Or, maybe, just talk to your friends about what it feels like to listen to a modern classic.",

        "article_text": "Ditching your aesthetic (hairy noise-rock troupe) in favor of its polar opposite (neatly groomed pop-dance trio) is a sure way to get some pre-release hype, but the transformation of Chromatics has been so effortless that its still easy to be wowed by the results. Those who caught the swooning glide of the Chromatics \"Nite\" single last year-- or their contributions to the After Dark compilation earlier in 2007-- wont be shocked by the similarly sleek Night Drive (aka IV). But listeners who are only familiar with the bands forays into shambling punk will certainly be surprised by Night Drives assured songwriting (which would wow even if the band had been chasing this narcotic Eurodisco sound for years) and how it wrings ravishment out of electro moves that should be long-drained of their charms.\nCredit some of this to Johnny Jewel-- Chromatics member, one half of Glass Candy, and the economical production whiz/secret weapon in the much-feted Italians Do It Better camp. I have no idea how duties on Night Drive were divvied up between Jewel, founding member Adam Miller, and vocalist Ruth Radalet. But you can certainly hear all of the IDIB trademarks: doleful disco-punk guitars (the menacing clang of \"Healer\"), starkly monochrome synth patches (especially gorgeous on the bumping goth club slow-jam \"Lets Make This a Moment to Remember\"), watery keyboard progressions (ditto), and exploitation flick arpeggios (\"Tomorrow Is So Far Away\"). Even as theyve dumped the genres sonic baggage, Chromatics have retained punks taste for spare arrangements, but drawing on overripe Moroder-style dance music and early 1980s synth melancholia makes for some sumptuous spare arrangements.\nOf course, sumptuous production is often not enough, especially if all youre doing is cloaking a dead heart in good taste. But while the languorous, mid-tempo Night Drive may sway like its half-drugged, its heart is still beating, thank you very much. The record opens with a female voice (presumably Radalet) dialing her lover as the club rats scatter home from their nights out, and when she winsomely closes the call by telling him that she loves him, she proves that (however much she comes across like a cutie pie version of Nico) shes no ice queen. Even when she sounds half-tranquilized, its Radalet that adds the very necessary soft touch to all those implacable sequencers. Throughout Night Drive, whether at a kittenish whisper or a husky, longing sigh, her cauterized range fits the bands vision of disco recast as heartsick pop. And even when wholly instrumental on \"The Killing Spree\"-- forget the title, the sinister descending keyboard fuzz does a perfect job evoking a murderous robot sci-fi flick on its own-- the band uses what could be sterile pastiche to pull your strings. Tastefully.\nNight Drives peak is the rightfully praised cover of Kate Bushs \"Running Up That Hill\", where the band shifts the focus of the (already minimal) arrangement onto three sour keyboard notes and a dapple of guitar. Radalet sounds like the school wallflower trying on the queen of frou frou art-pop, her unsteady hold on Bushs delivery cracking into a yearning coo at the chorus (about as demonstrative as she gets), making for the only moment on the record where the band really lets their emotional guard down. Haters and fans alike often call this neo-disco stuff \"cold\" and \"dark,\" but I think thats just code for \"not kitschy\" (on the plus side) or maybe \"not emotionally open enough\" (on the minus side). But while Night Drive might not be warm, it does feel intimate, like a 3 a.m. ride home, where youre not alone but exhaustion and intake have made talking impossible, the city is silent, and the traffic patterns are as comforting and regimented as a drum machine click track. One of those moments, to paraphrase Ms. Bush, when you should be crying, but youll be damned if you let it show.",

        "article_text": "\"[Im] struggling, really, to be honest,\" Reggie Youngblood said on a 102-degree day in Georgia this summer. It was between songs during Black Kids set at Athens Popfest, and the singer/guitarists onstage banter wasnt sounding quite as sharp as his songwriting. The guitar-jangling, Jacksonville-based five-piece were hardly \"struggling\" musically, though: Eyewitness raves about the performance spread faster than you can say \"Technorati,\" and positive notices soon followed from the NME, Vice, The Guardian, and, yes, Pitchfork. All this for a band with no announced label, or even much touring history.\nYou can download Black Kids four-song demo, Wizard of Ahhhs, for free on their MySpace-- its not available in stores. Theyre giving away something we cant buy often enough: a record with not just a distinctive aesthetic, but also one single-worthy track after another. Dueling keyboards and scrappy lo-fi guitars give rise to Go! Team-style shouted-back cheers, a communal urgency not unlike the Arcade Fires, and an uptempo bounce paying homage to Motown 45s. In short, Black Kids make catchy, tightly executed songs that put a memorable stamp on pops classic themes.\nBlack Kids offer their most immediate bid for pop dominance with the ridiculously good \"Im Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You\", which we put on repeat over at Forkcast a couple weeks back. Here, Youngbloods reverb-doused guitar spars with Owen Holmes declarative bass, Kevin Snows drums, and bright keyboards by Dawn Watley and Youngbloods sister Ali over whether there will be dancing, or just pogoing.\nEven when Youngblood doesnt get the girl, hes an astute enough student of Morrisseys to shade his songs with playful gender ambiguity: \"You are the girl that Ive been dreaming of ever since I was a little girl,\" he sings on \"Im Not Gonna Teach\". On \"Hurricane Jane\", a staccato guitar riff leaves room for decadent synths and a bare, melodic bass line. \"Oh, youve been playing nice, but I can see it in your eyes/ Youre thinking, Christ, hes everybodys girl,\" Youngblood describes, then trades question marks for exclamation points on an ecstatically miserable chorus: \"Its Friday night and I aint got nobody/ Whats the use of making the bed?\" The object of his affection, voiced by either Watley or Ali Youngblood, aint having it.\nOn Wizard of Ahhhs, though, its just as likely the girls will be chasing the boy. Opener \"Hit the Heartbrakes\" backs up its goofy pun with surging lead guitar and such a cold (if tongue-in-cheek) move that only a guy who can really dance could hope to pull it off. Hes really flattered, Youngblood explains, but theres no way he wants to meet the parents, let alone the siblings, nieces, and nephews: \"Its quite all right, you can stay the night/ But please be gone by next mornings light.\" After all, \"Its not me, its you.\"\nThe record leads to a beautifully conceited conclusion. On \"Ive Underestimated My Charm (Again)\", Youngblood graciously blames his admirers pain on his own charisma. He sings this deadpan to a girl caught, in a detail that would make Stuart Murdoch proud, \"giving head to a statue.\" The track also suggests a broader fascination with pop history. Theres a possible allusion to Positive Ks \"I Got a Man\", an innocent 1950s chord progression on the verses, and a coda with the ostinato bass of classic Motown-- or at least the Arcade Fires \"Wake Up\". \"Every time we kiss, its like an inside joke I always miss,\" Youngblood finishes.\nBlack Kids are such good-natured pop-cultural sponges that they opened their fateful Athens Popfest set by reciting a screwball exchange from the Jim Henson-directed David Bowie fantasy film Labyrinth (a back-and-forth borrowed from Cary Grants The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer). It was an inside joke many might have missed. Black Kids are plenty savvy enough to have known exactly what they were doing when they changed their bands name from World War I femme fatale reference Mata Hari, even though the Youngblood siblings are the groups sole African-American members. Unduly provocative? Personally, Im shocked to discover a great young guitar group whose name includes the word \"Kids.\" What a world.",

        "article_text": "Theres a crash and a scream, and the groaning sound of a warship come to rape the harbor: Thats right, The Decemberists have another song about pirates. \"Tell your daughters do not walk the streets alone tonight!\" cries Colin Meloy with nasal urgency, and the band gives it more drama than ever before, lunging into an aesthetic thats half Dickens, half 1950s adventure comic book. You can almost smell the mothballs on their costumes. They dont care that some listeners wont even make it past this song, or that some people dont want to hear a pirate story no matter how well its told.\nThe Decemberists may never escape the label \"quirky,\" which is a crime: Whatever the style, Colin Meloys songwriting makes this band one of the strongest working today. His melodies are so perfect and his words so substantial that it reminds you how much slack you cut most other bands. Too many singers mumble or screech as if they didnt trust or care about their words: Meloy declares his lyrics, lets his work live or die by them, and sets them deep in masterful pop surroundings.\nThe bands confidence actually makes Her Majesty The Decemberists less accessible than their other releases. Their earliest material, on the 5 Songs EP, didnt stray far from acoustic alt-country, but their first full-length, Castaways and Cutouts-- which many people discovered only a few months ago, thanks to its reissue on Kill Rock Stars-- was a revelation, sometimes brilliant and sometimes a beautiful accident. Its dreamy tone erred on the side of melancholy; by contrast, Her Majesty veers toward the theatrical as Meloy steps up the role-playing and tells more intricate stories.\nOn \"Shanty for the Arethusa\" and \"The Chimbley Sweep\", the band marches aggressively past the just-skilled-enough playing of their other albums, sounding like a version of The Coral thats twice as smart (and half as loud). The horns, strings and keys theyve brought in this time sweeten the production, and they nail the upbeat Britpop arrangement on \"Billy Liar\", a song about a dull summer break that has what sounds like a lovestruck chorus. Theres also romance in \"A Soldiering Life\", a homoerotic ode to the military. Its winningly clever, and even if its not the deepest song in their repertoire, you have to credit Meloys enthusiasm when he practically drools the word \"stevedore.\" Its just one display of the surgical precision of Meloys lyrics, along with the taut ballad \"Red Right Ankle\", or the rich imagery of \"Bachelor and the Bride\".\nBut whats most intriguing about Meloys style isnt his erudition or kitsch; its the strange tension he creates by mashing both qualities together. \"Los Angeles Im Yours\" sounds odd not just because he matches the disgusted lyrics with a breezy tune, but because he throws old-fashioned, florid language-- references to \"orphans and oligarchs\" and taunts like \"I can see your undies\"-- against post-modern Los Angeles. And in \"Red Right Ankle\", he alternates between a metaphorical and anatomical use of the word \"heart.\" Describing a girls suitors, he sings, \"Some had crawled their way into your heart/ To rend your ventricles apart.\" We know Meloy can slop through pirate gore in one song and write poetry in the next, but its more interesting to hear how easily he can do both-- and how willfully hell do either.\nAs theyve become bolder, The Decemberists have lost some of the uncertain dreaminess of the best songs on Castaways-- say, \"Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect\" or \"Grace Cathedral Hill\". But Castaways near-transcendent finale, \"California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade\", is matched here by \"I Was Meant for the Stage\", where Meloy doesnt just state his ambitions, but stands at the front of the crowd and waits for the tomatoes to fly. Maybe from here theyll become an esoteric cult band, or maybe theyll just keep getting better: Either way, The Decemberists have already established themselves so thoroughly that I was able to make it through an entire review without comparing them to Neutral Milk Hotel or namechecking Edward Gorey. Theyre an unclassifiable American original, and they could turn out to be one of our best.",

        "article_text": "Anyone craving a quick schooling in vintage Americana can spin Harry Smiths The Anthology of American Folk Music or Dust to Digitals Goodbye, Babylon, memorize Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings, or waddle through In the Shadow of Clinch Mountain, the Bear Familys gorgeous, heart-skewering Carter Family box set. But if youre more interested in hearing ancient mountain and Delta traditions synthesized-- scratched up, muddied, and re-imagined for an America more reliant on machines than the grace of God-- curl up with Califones Roots and Crowns, the Chicago collectives staggering homage to starts and finishes, computers and cornfields, dirty feet and throbbing foreheads.\nRoots and Crowns is Califones most sophisticated record to date, a natural-- if lighter-- extension of 2004s Heron King Blues, and a coherent aesthetic declaration (which is even more of a triumph considering it was recorded in chunks with new gear, after frontman Tim Rutili packed up for California and the bands instruments were raided during their last tour). This is Califones climax: Roots and Crowns blurs all lines between the organic and the synthesized, and is as much a product of the gut as the mind, with each perfectly placed skronk-and-twitter hitting its intellectual and emotional targets.\nOver the course of eight full-lengths, Califone have proven their prowess for improvisational out-jazz and melodic scrap-folk in equal measure-- Roots and Crowns sees both impulses at play, over some of the bands best-written songs. Longtime engineer (and former Red Red Meat member, and part-time Califone percussionist) Brian Deck orchestrates the loops and squeaks, piecing distinct, synthesized bits into cohesive pictures, and ensuring that the end result still sounds like something your dog dug up in the backyard and spit out, slobber-slicked and gummed, on your front doormat.\nLyrically, Rutili favors tiny, imagistic vignettes over narrative arcs, and these songs read more like prose poems than stories-- which, given the hyper-fragmented sound-collage of Califones instrumentation, makes a certain kind of sense. In addictive opener \"Pink and Sour\", Rutilli talks-- twice-- about losing his language over rollicking tribal drums and slide guitar (\"Along your skin/ Lost my language,\" \"Cotton in the calm along your side/ Lost my language\"), and his bandmates compensate in full, slipping in vivid percussive flourishes that speak remarkably well in his absence. On the whimsical \"Spiders House\", fellow Chicagoans Bitter Tears lend brassy toots, muted trumpet and trombone sighing, resigned and tired, while Rutilis rusty pipes spew abstract laments: \"After the quiet bleeds peel and age familiar/ Peace in the pain.\" \"The Orchids\", lifted from former-Throbbing Gristle outfit Psychic TV, is, according to Rutili, the records inspiration, and is beautifully rendered here-- Rutili s voice is cottony and vaguely-love-struck, while wisps of harmonica weave in and out of his coos.\nCalifone have always been stupidly underappreciated, and the further we stumble into the 21st century, the more this music starts to feel both familiar and necessary: Roots and Crowns is bluesy and soulful without reverting to revivalist schtick, and experimental without relying on blind cut-and-pasting. It is old and new, dirty and clean, alienating and accessible, sweet and ugly, organic and industrial, doting and vicious. It is one of the most quintessentially American records imaginable.",

        "article_text": "Between Sunset Rubdown, Wolf Parade, Frog Eyes, and Swan Lake, Spencer Krug might be the most prolific indie rocker this side of Bob Pollard. The Montreal-based musician may still be best known for Wolf Parade, but while that bands flash-and-bang masks some surprisingly subtle songwriting, Sunset Rubdowns music quietly creeps under your skin. Despite the unifying thread of Krugs cracked, emphatic voice, Wolf Parades bombast and Sunset Rubdowns nuance make them very different bands.\nThere are precedents for the elegant, cobwebby Random Spirit Lover: Frog Eyes dark, dramatic vocals and abstruse lyrics, Xiu Xius creepy instrumentation, and Modest Mouses off-kilter guitar rock. But these predecessors are, at best, just a frame-- its Krugs exquisite attention to detail that makes this such a striking album. Random Spirit Lovers songs have verses, choruses, and bridges like most other pop/rock songs, but theyre so architecturally complex and harmoniously joined that the boundaries between them become erased. In a song-driven era, Sunset Rubdown is making a strong case for the album.\nKrug stitches his suites together so adeptly that its difficult to tell where one ends and the next begins, and yet, each song still retains its own unique character-- a testimony to the albums careful crafting. The ascending plateaus of \"Magic Vs. Midas\" are shaggy and dim; \"The Courtesan Has Sung\" is a taut and martial; \"Winged/Wicked Things\" has a paradoxically bruising delicacy; \"Colt Stands Up, Grows Horns\" juxtaposes an atmospheric expanse with an inward-looking finale.\nBut while Random Spirit Lover is dense and thorny-- even opaque, at times-- its never haphazard. Its sonics are robustly melodic with layers of depth that emerge over time. \"The Mending of the Gown\" builds block by block, each amplifying the impact of its undulating melody. \"For the Pier (and Dead Shimmering)\" establishes a celestial uplift with harpsichord and synth tones, then collapses into a rock anthem. \"The Taming of the Hands that Came Back to Life\" features singing guitar leads, dewy glockenspiels, and squelchy synths in its sprightly stutter-step.\nThroughout all this instrumental pageantry, Krugs vocal presence is strong, both as a stylist and a lyricist. Theres more than a whiff of obscure mysticism and archaic vocabulary in his lyrics, which might turn off more literal listeners. But Krug has a knack for couching his baffling imagery in compelling, repetitive syntax that shapes a narrative from his procession of characters-- courtesans, jackals, virgins, and stallions.\nInsofar as I can boil down Sunset Rubdown to a single moment, its one near the end of \"Up on Your Leopard, Upon the End of Your Feral Days\". The songs maniacal carnival music, which until this point has rocketed through a rollercoasters worth of peaks and valleys, settles into barren dirge where Krugs lyrics come clear. \"Because youre the one whos riding around on a leopard,\" he sings with his usual creaky splendor. \"Youre the one whos throwing dead birds in the air.\" This moment doesnt compartmentalize Sunset Rubdown; it traces out the broadest contours of their allure: The striking image that sticks in the mind, unfathomable but heavy with meaning, for days; the carefully contrasted song structure, and the sense that this is a band uncompromising in its vision, making music with more depth and longevity than its stubborn relegation to \"side project\" merits.",

        "article_text": "It was a little disturbing at first to hear that Joanna Newsoms full-length follow-up to the ambitious and polarizing Ys would be a triple album. Where 2004s The Milk-Eyed Mender was an unusual record with its share of quirks (her squeaky voice and fondness for arcane language, the harp), it also had its simple pleasures. Most of the tracks were short and the sound was spare; you pretty much liked it or you didnt based on how you felt about Newsoms sound and her ability to put a song together. Ys, on the other hand, was unapologetically dense. The five songs averaged more than 10 minutes each, and through them Newsom sang continuously; Van Dyke Parks arrangements were similarly relentless, seeming to comment upon and embellish almost every line. It was a rewarding album-- filled with memorable turns of phrase and impressive storytelling. Many were enthralled, and almost everyone at least admired it. But in comparison to Milk-Eyed, Ys took some serious work to crack. So when I heard that Newsom would be following it with a 3xLP set called Have One on Me, I had troubling visions of 25-minute songs with lyrics that stretched to 5,000 words.\nAs it turns out, Have One on Me is a \"triple album\" in the vinyl sense, in the same way that the Flaming Lips Embryonic is a \"double album,\" even though it fits onto one CD. There are 18 songs here, and they total about two hours. To pick a couple of reference points from the CD era, thats the same length as Smashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, and just a bit longer than Biggies Life After Death. Two hours is a lot of music, but having it broken into three discs, each the length of a 1970s LP, helps. You can dip into Have One on Me at a given point, listen for a while, and move on to something else. But while the album invites sampling, Ive found myself returning to a different section each time I sit down with it. The highlights are spread out evenly, and Newsom couldnt have sequenced the record any better.\nWhile songs here evoke moments of Ys and Milk-Eyed and Newsoms harp is still the dominant musical focus, its striking how much Have One on Me feels like its own thing. Not a progression, exactly, more of a deepening. You can feel roots going down and an edifice being built. Her voice has gained depth and she sings with more force and clarity, so thats part of it. And the arrangements are more judicious and draw less attention to themselves (some tracks are just harp, others add horns, strings, and percussion, but with a lighter touch). But the bigger difference seems to be the overall mood, which is expansive and welcoming. The best songs feel more like conversations rather than artworks to be hung on the wall and admired from several paces away. Newsom seems to sing from somewhere deep inside of them, and her earthy presence has a way of drawing you in, bringing you closer to her music than youve been before.\nThe name youll most hear in discussion of this record is Joni Mitchell. Part of it is that Newsom can sound a fair bit like her with her more richly textured voice. Sometimes, almost eerily so, like on \"In California\" (the way she wraps the vocal melody around the evocative title word is just a few miles up the PCH from Blues \"California\"). In addition to her voice and phrasing, the more approachable songs here, from the stirring harp-and-voice ballads \"Jackrabbits\" and \"Esme\" to the funny, weird, and hugely appealing road song \"Good Intentions Paving Company\", have bluesy chord progressions that stand in stark contrast to the rigid folk modes of Ys. These songs sway and heave with a warmth and approachability that are new for Newsom. They, and several others like them, offer a fresh way into Newsoms music for the curious.\n\"The phantom of love moves among us at will,\" goes a line in \"Esme\". Most of the songs here deal with love in some form, another quality that connects Have One on Me to the broader singer-songwriter tradition. Sometimes the love is romantic; other times its about friendship or family. Newsom sometimes approaches the subject from her elliptical perch, talking in pictures-- \"Each phantom-limb lost has got an angel (so confused, like the wagging bobbed-tail of a bulldog),\" is the line that follows the one above in \"Esme\". But though Newsom indulges her gift for imagery early and often, Have One on Me has moments of simplicity and directness, where the tangled phrases can be boiled down to, \"Life can be difficult and lonely and we all need love, but holding on to it can be hard.\"\nOne significant difference between Newsom and Mitchell is that the latter, especially early in her career, was writing songs that would sound good on the radio. For better or worse, Newsom is not a pop singer-- thats just not what she does. So I dont want to overstate this records accessibility. A few tracks here, especially longer ones like the title track and \"Kingfisher\", approach the winding density that marked Ys. On these, song structure is elusive-- at any given moment youre not sure if youre listening to a verse, chorus, or bridge. The lyric sheet helps a bit, but with two hours of music to digest, you wont feel too guilty about using the skip button here and there, or digesting the record in pieces. Helpfully, returning to the most immediate songs causes their charm and appeal to bleed into the tracks that surround them-- so the album seems to grow and change as you listen.\nHave One on Me begins with \"Easy\", about a wish for the kind of life the title suggests, and closes with \"Does Not Suffice\", which finds the narrator packing up a house to leave after a breakup, putting away all that reminds her lover of how \"easy [she] was not.\" The latter is subtitled \"In California, Refrain\", it uses a similar gospel-inflected progression as the earlier song, and its flat-out gorgeous, heavy with sadness (\"the tap of hangers swaying in the closet\") but also exhibiting quiet dignity and strength. Its my favorite song here, and it comes last, which is a dependable sign that Ill be returning to an album often. When I hear Newsom sing the word \"easy\" in \"Suffice\" and my mind jumps back to the opener, it reinforces just how many threads shes weaved between those songs and how incredible it is to discover new things with every listen.",

        "article_text": "\"huh-HAAWWWACK.\" I dont know if I transcribed it properly, but Chris Hansells revolting cough, which appeared midway through the Mens 2011 LP Leave Home, was pretty much everyones favorite lyric from the record. Understandably so. While Leave Home was often ugly and brutal, it felt almost physically necessary, an allergic reaction to the repression of all things abrasive and loud amidst indie rocks digitized echo chamber. The music itself was bracing enough, but perhaps the biggest shock of all was hearing a Brooklyn band that didn’t carry themselves like they were primarily motivated by a desire to make friends.\nBut for fans of aggressive indie rock as described in Our Band Could Be Your Life, thats an easy image to project on the Men and, as the band told us in a Rising interview earlier this year, not necessarily a correct one. Now a steady four-piece, theyre setting the record straight on Open Your Heart, the title of which is so plainspoken and commonplace its easy to overlook just how much the band backs it up by maintaining every last bit of visceral power of Leave Home while letting in so many more people to the party. Open Your Heart is both tremendously physical and friendly, knocking you on your ass one second, then immediately helping you back up to put a beer in your hand.\nAnd I cant stress the word \"party\" enough, because its difficult to remember a rock record that managed to be this much fun without resorting to cheerleading. Most people Ive played opener \"Turn It Around\" for have remarked on its resemblance to Foo Fighters introductory salvo \"This Is a Call\". Its pretty on-point: Mark Perros vocals sound remarkably similar to those of a young Dave Grohl on this particular song, but whats crucial is how they align in spirit. \"Turn It Around\" comes off like a tribute to the pure rejuvenating powers of rocknroll itself by going nuts with all the things that got you hooked the first time: breakneck Zep riffs! Duel-guitar leads! Drum solos!  Its essentially a teenagers highlight reel, and the giddiness of Open Your Heart comes through in ostensibly meaningless slogans like \"I wanna see you write a love song!/ I wanna see you go down!/ I wanna see you when you try so hard!/ I wanna see you when you turn it around!\" Compare it to the only lyric of Leave Homes opener \"If You Leave…\": \"I would die.\"\nWhile theres a surface shift in attitude, Open Your Heart shares Leave Homes uncanny ability to balance reverence and irreverence, enthusiasm, and expertise, treating the last four decades of rock music like an amusement park rather than a museum. \"Country Song\" isnt even the one song on Open Your Heart deserving of that title (that would be \"Candy\"), but it shows how their minds work. A gummy tremolo riff, whining pedal steel, and an atypical waltz beat are the raw ingredients, but through the Mens artistic prism, it becomes something akin to a Southern bar band saying \"fuck it\" and letting their freak flag fly for a lengthy last-call jam.  Likewise, is the title of \"Presence\" an indication that theyre trying out the sort of loose, blues-prog of that particular Led Zeppelin album? With its patient, patient build and tamboura-ish drone, maybe it is, but like most of Open Your Heart, the referential recognition is a bonus rather than the end result.\nOf course, the question with Open Your Heart is how it can manage to be such a thrill despite conceivably doing nothing actually new. Not to demystify what the Men do here or downplay the artistry, but these guys strike me as fixers and problem solvers. I hear a band analyzing modes that have just become tired and stodgy and delivering them back running smoother than ever. Liked the coed ragers from the last Fucked Up album, but wish it wasn’t neutered by thousands of overdubs? Have a blast with the all-id caterwaul of \"Animal\". Wish krautrock ditched the metronomic straitjacket and actually rocked? There’s \"Oscillation\", which hums more like a motorbike than a motorik, punctuated with blasts of pure MC5 ruckus. Want Isnt Anything-styled shoegaze with a backbone? An SST throwback without the razor-thin production? Alt-country without having to deal with Deer Ticks obnoxiousness? Enjoy the midrecord trifecta of \"Please Don’t Go Away\", the title track, and \"Candy\".\nIt isnt diversity for diversitys sake, though-- Open Your Heart is smartly sequenced to metabolize genre and morph like a masterful DJ mix, subtly rationing out its true peaks even while seemingly going full-throttle throughout. After the 1-2 headbutt of \"Turn It Around\" and \"Animal\", \"Country Song\" provides a momentary breather and also a swooning leadup to the Men at their most gorgeous and overwhelming, the tail end of which has \"Please Dont Go Away\" ushering in Open Your Hearts most traditionalist stretch. But just when it feels like Side B is going to be the Mens straight-up indie rock record, they burn that bridge with the willfully destructive two and a half minutes of \"Cube\", which then builds another one towards the LPs bright and expansive closers. And while \"Ex-Dreams\" doesnt overtly sound like a curtain call, there are two points during Open Your Hearts finale where everything drops out but a steady, crowd-pleasing drum break and you can all but imagine Perro happily lending the listener a chance to give themselves a round of applause for being such a good audience.\nWe havent talked much about what the Men actually say on Open Your Heart-- about half of its 10 songs are instrumentals or something close. To get to its lyrical center, youll have to go through \"Candy\", the one I imagine many might consider the dud or at least the outlier on account of foregrounding acoustic guitars. On the toast-worthy chorus, Perro sings \"When I hear the radio play/ I dont care that its not me.\" Around the same time I stared hearing \"Candy\", many of my colleagues were pushing \"Radio\" as the true standout on Lana Del Reys Born to Die, a song that uses hearing oneself on the airwaves as a means of self-validation and smiting ones enemies. That sort of thing can only help \"Candy\" to be misread as being another in a long line of \"Left of the Dial\"-type, anti-mainstream indie rock lectures-- that its drunk-country shamble recalls the Replacements doesnt hurt either.\nBut when you consider the lyrics that come immediately after-- \"Remember the days Id shout anything for you to see me/ I could never sing now my voice it rings.../ I just quit my job/ now I can stay out all night long\"-- its clear that like most of Open Your Heart, its not at all angry and, in fact, quite content.  All four members of the Men are at the border of 30, an age where you have enough critical distance from your youth and life experience to really start to figure out what success means to you. If I read \"Candy\" correctly, its about being able to make a living off this thing while being a very loud band with no radio prospects whatsoever on a boutique label: the rewards seem modest by most standards, but once achieved it means everything, the sort of self-sufficiency thats inspired indie bands to form since forever.\nBefore Leave Home became their first widely available LP, the Mens recorded output consisted mostly of self-made cassettes that they recently gave away for free through their website.  They had to play a little rough if they wanted to be heard.  A year later, Open Your Heart is the sort of record that proves while pain and loss are often viewed as great arts true catalysts, bands like the Men can be inspired by the sort of confidence born of the bills being paid and the boss no longer breathing down their necks. And theyre passing on the goodwill to everyone who made it possible: if you bought their t-shirt, came to their show, raved about Leave Home on your Tumblr, or seek to carry on tradition by starting your own band, Open Your Heart is the Men thanking you in the best way possible.",

        "article_text": "When last we left Mission of Burma, in the summer of 1985, they were stuffed with free food care of Massachusetts finest music magazine, Forced Exposure, and laying their past bare in an ungodly long interview. I had just turned ten. Fifteen years later, when the band announced their reunion, I interviewed drummer Peter Prescott for Pitchfork, and comparing my notes with the FE interview Id picked up as a teenager, it didnt seem a day had gone by. Mission of Burmas composite disgust with pretense remains steadfast, all these years later. A de facto bullshit detector for the blow-wave 1980s, the bands millennial reunion was more than timely, it was desperately necessary.\nWelcomed as resurrected saviors during a dearth of decent anti-rock, aught-era Burma countered a preponderance of prissy clothes, 45-degree bangs and sunglasses mirroring the insubstantial times Bostons brattiest first set out to harass. But as the reconstituted band eases into their third year back together, the exasperated, relativistic accolades have to give way to honest examination. Burma are past rolling out the barrel, and while OnOffOn offers some throwbacks, overall, the record seeks to compete with-- and indirectly critique-- a landscape they admittedly have little time for. The universal positivity surrounding their return has gone on long enough that some are starting to bristle, especially some younger bands, who feel classic underground acts like Burma and Sonic Youth are blocking the spotlight. The age gap is apparent, but frankly, its on the upstarts to upstage either bands new record.\nFrom the start, Burma trained on The Moment to the exclusion of all else, as present-tense as their confrontational no-wave peers, yet capable of conveying enervation without resorting to structural devolution or acoustic warfare. In an era when \"sonic exploration\" meant the same goddamn synthesizer on every stage, Burma thickened their sound the only way that made sense, using their output as an input device. Or, OutInOut.\nThough Bob Weston makes a less adventurous tape-manipulator than Martin Swope, OnOffOn segues well with Burmas fabulously frantic second album Vs., adding some striking, if smoother, new elements. Clint Conleys recent work with Consonant informs the most accessible material, particularly \"Falling\", which in its acoustic sheen begins as a tribute to one of Burmas favorite opening acts, Hüsker Dü, before resolving in a gorgeous dual-gender duet that, one imagines, might draw guffaws in culture covered by Forced Exposure.\n\"Falling\" also proves Roger Miller has mellowed with age, leaving behind the stark midnight of \"Trem Two\" for dramatic vocals and brighter guitar lines, often reminiscent of fIREHOSE. The shift toward patience puts Peter Prescotts \"The Enthusiast\" in a jam; while its an irrefutably a classic Burma tune, the sneering punk of early 80s screamers like \"Dumbells\" and \"Sing-Along\" seems long lost amid the layered guitars of \"Max Ernsts Dream\" and \"Wounded World\". The most pointedly modern-minded track in this stylistic whirlwind (which spirals to overextension on \"Prepared\", evoking early 90s R.E.M.), \"Wounded World\" culls a few chords from Sonic Youth, looking back to the raging Vs., and boasts the records most erotic and evil lyric: \"Once, you were on my side/ But I will make you wish that I had died.\" If only the rest of the record were so beautifully bitter.\nNever afraid to judge their own work, Burma update three of their best early 80s outtakes for OnOffOn, rescuing \"Hunt Again\", \"Dirt\" and \"Playland\" from the TAANG! sepulcher theyve been trapped in for a decade now. \"Hunt Again\" and \"Dirt\" are perfectly polished, maintaining the original, jagged tempos while flushing out harmonies and guitar leads buried by the border-mono demos fans have lived with for so long. \"Dirt\" serves as the records lead single, but its probably too SST for the preening hair-goo geeks clogging dance-floors to prove they like Duran Duran. (\"Like, not ironically either!\")\nWhich is where Mission of Burma won out, historically speaking; its why so many wanted them back, and why they continue to matter. Like few bands before or since, Burma manage to call out whats wrong with music, using their own as a beacon, never a weapon. Abstract, yet brutally honest, Burma shame the transparent, insecure and phony, reminding us that ideals can be standards. Conviction will never go out of style, and thats how Mission of Burma escaped their certain fate, drawing on the undying devotion of the suspicious and stalwart. Punks (sic) not dead.",

        "article_text": "Dance music is pretty gay.\nLets not beat around bush, my stalwart indie-rocking comrades: In our world, lyrics can be heartfelt, songs can be ironic, albums can be post-grammatological, and occasionally, guitars can be acoustic. But unless theres some punk behind that disco, we arent likely to indulge in dance music too often-- let alone dance to it. Because unlike indie rock, dance musics all the same, its gay, and if its in Massachusetts, its equal marriage rights are probably going to be denied.\nWait a second: Is it 1998 again? Because I remember more than a few of us thought the same thing about IDM, until we were all persuaded to pick up Boards of Canadas Music Has the Right to Children. It was electronica and it was taboo, but we purchased in good faith because it was on Matador, a label we trusted. Boy, did we love the shit out of it-- and there werent even guitars!\nErlend Øyes DJ Kicks seems like that kind of gateway record. Its most instantly alluring trait is its surprising pop/rock-accessibility, but-- for a guy most people know for his tenure in the hushed folk duo Kings of Convenience-- its also remarkably innovative in its field. Here, in a move that really is not as gimmicky as it might seem, Øye frequently dubs his own buoyant tenor over bright dancefloor instrumentals and vocal tracks. Interestingly, these lyrics are often culled from well-known pop classics (such as The Smiths \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\"), with slight melodic changes. Its a fascinating, vaguely mash-up-like approach that effectively softens the blow for non-tech-house listeners, while also assuring each track a strong hook and lending the record a quality often underdeveloped in other DJ mixes: namely, a discernible personality.\nEnough cant be said about the quality and variety of these tracks, and the unique sense of humor with which Øye approaches their sequencing. Take how subtly Øye gives new life to Jürgen Paapes \"So Weit Wie Noch Wie\", an instant tech-house gem that notably appeared on Kompakts Total 3 compilation: If only because the song is so often associated with the close of that mix, it takes on an unusual potency as Øyes kickoff. The Paape opener is firm anchorage for the string of slick German dance tracks which Øye weaves in and out of the other numbers: Justus Köhnckes slick 1980s-meets-2100s groove \"2 After 909\"; Jackmates phaseshifted jitterbug \"Airraid\"; Ricardo Villalobos blipped-up but downtrodden \"Dexter\".\nØyes slick tech-house base allows him some indulgences: There are the truly laidback moments like his tasteful remix of Cornelius \"Drop\", Phoenixs less dance-oriented but utterly catchy French house gem \"If I Ever Feel Better\", and downright silly tracks like Avenue Ds \"2D2F\". Its amazing the latter track works as well as it does: its lyrics (\"Dont pass out going down on me/ Or Ill wake you up with a mouth full of pee\" is but one) put the entire Peaches and Fannypack catalogs to shame.\nFor these moments alone, the mix is perfectly enjoyable, but where Øye distinguishes himself is on two back-to-back tracks near the end of DJ Kicks, in which he explosively pits the familiar against the obscure. Over a dark monochromatic Silicon Soul remix of Röyksopps \"Poor Leno\", Øye overdubs his soft but confident croon of The Smiths \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\", which reaches a quiet climax when Øyes vocals from \"Poor Leno\" surface momentarily in the background, then disappear. Just as compelling is when the ultra-obscure track Skateboards \"Metal Chix\" provides a velvet-metal backdrop for Øyes heartfelt delivery of \"Always on My Mind\", synching up the chorus with the accompaniments dreamy interlude. We could stand more mash-ups like this and much less Jay-Zeezer.\nThose two songs seem to encapsulate Øyes intentions with his DJ Kicks album. In the liner notes, he places his DJ style somewhere between a house DJ who plays to drugs, dancing shoes, and \"the artistic dimension\", and a wedding DJ who plays strictly to vaguely foot-worthy nostalgia. \"I am not really a skilled beat-mixer,\" says Øye-- which is only sort of true-- but its clear that hes as concerned with his track selection as with making sure that his listeners are enjoying themselves: \"A good DJ is not only musically responsible, but he is also the host of the party.\" With DJ Kicks bearing testament, Øyes party is truly a democratic one: The record is as warm and welcoming for first-timers as for longtime tech-house addicts.\n ",

        "article_text": "I know nothing about Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyns early years but I always assumed that The Microphones most promising alumna grew up in a commune-- the kind where children tend to their own herb garden, perform light kitchen duty and rotate ownership of a bicycle. This (admittedly reductive) theory would explain not only the persistent whiff of the campfire that hovers about Mirahs music, but also her staggering lack of self-consciousness. A terrific songwriter when she bothers to finish her songs, Mirah finds her own creativity fascinating enough to share every stage of the process with her listeners: To date, her albums have brimmed with sketches, songlets, snatches of ambiance (crickets, etc.) and private snapshots of in-studio fun. At times, this 60/40 mix of confessional folk and art brut collage has felt somewhat unnatural and not a little indulgent.\nAt the same time, Mirahs blissed-out obliviousness to form and format has kept fans and critics in suspense: It was clear that as soon as she dropped the shtick, a great album would follow. Teasers were plentiful-- the Cinemascope sweep of \"Cold Cold Water\" chief among them-- but the record she hinted at didnt arrive until now. If all the past tense hasnt tipped you off already, Cmon Miracle is it. Mirah, it appears, has made the album weve been waiting for.\nThe authors endearing weirdness is still present; shes so utterly unconcerned with context that she kicks things off with a jazzy ballad whose chorus coos, \"Come away with me.\" This time around, however, Mirahs wilder impulses miraculously defer to songcraft first-- theres not a meandering note on the album. Her trademark plinky ukulele draws polite curlicues throughout the record (and never receives its own track listing); her barking percussion loops co-exist with warm 60s-style drums.\n\"The Light\" is an immediate highlight. A two-parter that unfolds like a power ballad in reverse, its first 90 seconds rock assuredly with a fantastically winding vocal line, while the second half slows to a serene coffeehouse strum. \"Were Both So Sorry\" is also quick to stand out-- of all Cmon Miracles 11 tracks, it comes closest to matching the bizarre grandeur of \"Cold Cold Water\". Unidentifiable instruments (is that an autoharp? harmonium? horns?) float in and out of its mix, just before a nasty synth pulse takes over halfway through. And at songs end, Mirahs fragile vocal enters just in time to keep it all from collapsing in a heap: \"Im sorry about so much, baby, but I know you understand.\"\nStraightforwardness does occasionally hinder Mirah in the lyric department. \"Jerusalem\" squanders one of the albums best melodies on \"lessons we should learn from all the fighting in the days of old\" and the admonishing chorus of, \"So, now, Jerusalem, you know that its not right.\" Thankfully, the singers sense of humor reappears just in time, in the albums gentle final third. Mirah loves a fun shuffle (witness Black Mountain Music Projects \"Oh! September\" and the French-folk pastiche of \"Light the Match\", off Advisory Committee), and here, \"The Dogs of Buenos Aires\" and the tango closer \"Exactly Where Were From\" lighten the proceedings a bit. The album winds down quietly, almost apologetically, as if seized by second thoughts about its own catchiness. But these songs need no apology-- Cmon Miracle is not a crass bid for popularity, just an organic shift towards pop idiom. I hope that Mirah herself doesnt view it as a compromise or a concession; from here, it just looks like growing up.",

        "article_text": "The now-forgotten British author Horace Vachell introduced polo to the Pacific Coast when he relocated to Southern California in 1882. Purchasing a large cattle ranch near Arroyo Grande, which he renamed Tally-Ho, Vachell bred ponies and even socialized in the costume of the sport. His greatest acclaim came from the 1905 novel The Hill, an aristocratic Icarus fable in which the son of a Liverpudlian merchant attends the elite Harrow boarding school, rising to cricket prominence before his evitable downfall and dismissal due to class difference. On his adopted home Vachell wrote, \"In addition to the family fool, the Englishman to be found on the Pacific Slope include the parsons son, the fortune teller, the moral idiot, the remittance man, and the sportsman.\"\nOne could lob three of those labels at Steven Morrissey, the most unremittingly Albion presence in modern Los Angeles, but he remains an entirely unique breed of Englishman in home or Hollywood. Bitter, witty, hypocritical, contradictory, self-aware, sardonic, and nostalgic, Morrisseys persona-- in person, or in song-- is never one-dimensional or quickly read. Consider the \"I\" in his songs to represent \"Morrissey\" with peril.\nThe media and his audience have consistently misinterpreted Morrisseys lyrics and statements. Everyone from the Warlock Pinchers to the Windsors levied opinions at his persona. The trend continues with You Are the Quarry. The record is not an anti-American treatise, an encomium to England, an epistolary revelation, or even a bold comeback, and magazines who claim such are lazy and reading off the kit. Laden with brilliant contradictions, press baiting rouse, dark comedy, and real human complexity, You Are the Quarry simply stands as the most entertaining and lushly melodic work of Morrisseys solo career, one of the most singular figures in Western pop culture from the last 20 years.\nIn an epitomatory 1989 interview with Greenscene Magazine, Morrissey castigated those in chinchilla coats. \"Its disgusting. Theyre disgusting,\" he spat. \"If I see someone wearing fur I ask them to take it out of view.\" In the same interview, he pointed out that synthetic shoes \"look silly\" and confessed to wearing leather footwear, as theres \"no sensible alternative.\" The first scenario seems unlikely and makes for a comedic envisioning (At the Savoy: \"Excuse me, madam, but that rabbit shawl must be taken out of public view\"), while the second statement reiterates that Morrissey never forsakes his role as photo-ready icon and dapper fashionist for a few cows.\nSimilarly, when he puts his hands on the hips of Liverpool and Hull to slowdance with England in \"Come Back to Camden\", the lyrics should be taken with the whole of the Winsford Rock salt mine. Obviously, a \"discoloured dark brown staircase,\" a \"slate grey Victorian sky,\" and \"the taste of the Thames\" fail to paint a whimsical postcard of home. Even those whove never choked for air while riding the 15 down Fleet Street can read the sarcasm without a spider map. Yet those weeping synthetic strings (violins and cellos use catgut and horsehair, by the way) flash \"I miss you\" in garish American neon.\nWhen Morrissey humorously mocks Americans with, \"You wonder why in Estonia they say, Hey, you, big fat pig, you fat pig,\" we laugh because most Americans dont know what Estonia is, let alone where it lies on the Baltic; fat Americans travel to Tucson not Talinn. Each of You Are the Quarrys 12 songs contains an equally delicious line. In \"Let Me Kiss You\", which incidentally features the most romantically melodic quasi-Marr guitar, Morrissey pulls the mask off an ostensible smooching ballad with the desperate gob of, \"And then you open your eyes and you see someone you physically despise but my heart is open.\" Those artificial maudlin strings that sweep back in afterwards seem like the most appropriately feeble yet crushing sound on the record. The supposed ode to his Hispanic fans, \"First of the Gang to Die\", even contains poetic and dreadful images like solar illumination sparkling in cement reservoirs and on human bone.\nTwo songs drive home Morrisseys modi operandi. On \"The World Is Full of Crashing Bores\", the fear of being a suburban meatsuit and an opposing love of cheap pop thrills drives him to an ending refrain of sincerely conveyed cliche with \"Take me in your arms and love me.\" The album closes with the quiff quivering mammoth, \"You Know I Couldnt Last\". Morrisseys tommy gun is pointed directly at the pop stars who take their passing charge with less zeal and erudition than himself. Robbie Williams and Jason Mraz would never use \"gelignite\" and \"evil legal eagles\" in a chorus, or dare stick their neck out for the critics. \"The teenagers who love you, they will wake up, yawn, and kill you,\" he croons. At his most biting he sounds most relaxed. At his most self-deprecating he sounds most energized. By the time the title comes up, after \"theres a cash register ringing and it weighs so heavily on my back,\" its again clear that \"I\" is not the first person. But it could be.\nLike fellow Southern Californians Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman, Morrissey shows no fear of offending or wrapping emotions in black humor, while exhibiting a deep passion for classic songwriting forms. Few-- possibly none-- would call the police \"uniformed whores\" and mockingly thank Jesus for bestowing him with love for which there is no receptacle on an album bulging with desire and soppy diapason. With a producer to match the vocal boldness of Morrissey, the record could have been pushed, musically, in a futuristic cinescope folk direction similar to recent The Flaming Lips. Flutes and piano and electric squelches peep through the sidewalk of simple lulling rhythms, acoustic guitar, and synthesizers. Jerry Finn, a Hollywood hack, knows only to throw all the parts out there with money stuffed in the panties. Prancing the choice embellishments in polo gear and avoiding standard rock mixing would have made the album perfect.\nThats a rather considerable caveat to tag on the end on a review, but if youre listening to Morrissey albums for riffs and licks youre missing the point. Any instrumental bed under such incandescent personality and booming voice would pale. Envisioning the songwriter at work brings to mind a woman picking at an acoustic or a fellow hunched over a piano with a drink. The genesis of Morrissey music remains ambiguous both physically and in intent.\nYou Are the Quarry sounds effortless, and seemingly anything that pours from Morrisseys mouth comes wrapped in well-formed wit and melody. Some may want him to simply yearn for his homeland, or a woman, or a man, or bitterly attack pop stars or American culture, as this is seen as some sort of bold personal statement, but personalities rarely run down such black and white divisions. Creating an emotionally muddled, cantankerous, baroque, funny, longing, introspective, world-critiquing album is the most personal act a man like Morrissey makes. It trickles down to the logo on the cover, the resuscitated Attack imprint, a vinyl reggae label that has no relation to his music, yet reflects the taste and scholarship and attitude of man who began his career in music writing geeky teenage letters to NME begging for better New York Dolls coverage.\nOften during the course of writing a review, as the CD plays again and again for the 13th and 14th times, a critic finds himself convincing himself more and more that the record is essential. Morrisseys nature inherently emboldens those looking to make a statement, and now that hes on the mark, I similarly feel the need to stick out my neck for his record. Then again, Horace Vachell eventually sold the ranch and moved back to England. You can go home again.\n ",

        "article_text": "When Dizzee Rascals \"I Luv U\" first leaked to the internet, it was accompanied by the rumor that it was made with an iBook and a cheapie pencil microphone. A ridiculous visual in retrospect-- iLife in Bow E3!-- but its interesting that someone somewhere thought it made more sense to tight-focus on Rascals tools rather than his environment. His environment, after all, was the real story; first in the parentless, concrete battleground that he narrated to lucid detail on Boy In Da Corner and later, in the incredible roster of talent that turned out to be lurking just off Dizzees camera all along.\nPart of the reason Boy In Da Corner sounded so immediate was because you could sense the friction of Dizzees story rubbing up against the as-yet-untold stories of those around him. In his lone voice, he always sounded defensive, like someone whod broken away from the pack and might have to spend the rest of his life running from it. \"MCs better start chattin about whats really happening,\" he spat on \"Brand New Day\", \"Because if you aint chattin about whats happening, then where you living, what you talking about?\" That was Dizzees dare to grime: exist. Now, 18 months later theres Kano, Terror Danjah, Goodz, Target, D Double E, Lady Sovereign-- its hard to imagine that grimes viability was ever in question.\nIn fact, as a genre, grime has probably never felt as exciting, vibrant, and promising as it does right now. Its surprising malleability has made it possible for producers to splinter off and pursue different strains-- some adorn their tracks with East Oriental timbres and scales; others go for frosty, brittle sounds; others prefer homemade noises with anxious, scattershot qualities. Sonically, it seems like no idea is too strange right now, just as long as its fresh. It doesnt hurt that hunger is woven into grimes DNA, either-- a competitive bloodflow only guarantees movement.\nAnd yet, for all of that, I cant say Im surprised that the only grime to register with the record-buying mainstream so far has been Rascals. Yeah, Wileys record was slept-on, but Shysties was a dog, and the jurys still out on a half-dozen full-lengths yet to come. Grime needs confrontation and a mix of personalities to properly assert itself-- it lends perfectly to the compilation format. And yet, underground mix tapes excepted, there hasnt been a single decent comp until now.\nLuckily, Run the Road is so fucking good that none of that really matters. A collection of \"greatest hits,\" some of which are close to a year old, it should rightfully become the de facto entry point for anyone with even a passing interest in this music. Not only does it provide a sweeping survey of the genres biggest figures, it strikes to the heart of grimes maneuverability by constantly changing gears without ever sounding anything less than massive. It is also full of more wonderful single moments than you would reasonably expect from an ensemble cast. Theres a new sound, a new voice, and a new idea at every turn-- I cant remember the last time a compilation had me this excited for a genre.\nHunger is the glue here. Despite the varying production aesthetics and emceeing styles, nearly everything on Run the Road sounds in danger of burning through the speakers. Frantic opener \"Cock Back (v1.2)\" has Terror Danjah, Riko, Bruza, D Double E, and Hyper getting rowdy over plink-plinks and an emptying clip; Roll Deep gushes Oriental synths out its slashed-open stomach on \"Let It Out\"; Kano gets streetwise and skittery on the reptilian \"Ps and Qs\"; remixer Terror Danjah turns the \"Cleaning Out My Closet\"-soundalike of Shysties \"One Wish\" into a universe-swallowing epic. Imagine a single voice toppling a chorus of screams, and then another voice shouting down that racket, and then another-- thats the net effect.\nI have no idea whether this is going to have the impact that it should. Its certainly too \"British\" to slot in with American hip-hop, but it was a pipedream to think that this incarnation of grime ever could. The sad truth is that I can easily envision a scenario where this does absolutely nothing, short of maybe sneaking into a few record stores through the back door. If thats the way things play out, fine, whatever, I give up. At least itll be the most incredible failure Ive ever heard.\n ",

        "article_text": "James Murphy makes great tracks. He isolates cowbells and places the microphone at just the right distance from the hi-hat so you get the analog-crisp sound post-punk bands took for granted because they didnt know how good they had it with engineers like Paul Hardiman and Rick Walton. Murphy, obsessed with Can and Liquid Liquid, has the right influences at the right time in the right city-- which is to say, if he couldnt be French, New York is the best place for LCD Soundsystem. Like Parisian duo Daft Punk (who get their second Murphy shout-out on this album), LCD makes substance from style, content from form, something from nothing. Thats a rockist attitude, of course, but then LCD Soundsystem is a rockist fantasy: full command of the history with none of the high-caloric obligation to \"meaning\" or purity. Murphy even puts together a live show that out-pummels the noise bands a borough over.\nLCD Soundsystem has been anticipated since Murphys 2002 splash \"Losing My Edge\"/\"Beat Connection\", and like it, makes clear that although his musical reference points (Suicide, Eno, Can, ESG, Talking Heads, the Fall, and on and on and on) are upfront enough to be conspicuous, they never quite cross the line into hipster-wallpaper. In fact, if anything, Murphy has a given a good name to cooler-than-thou poses, presenting his music, if not irony-free, then as earnestly as can be expected from someone emulating Mark E. Smiths pronunciation-uh. And yes, his flare for singles is pretty amazing: \"Losing My Edge\"/\"Beat Connection\" and \"Yeah\" are two of the most ubiquitous 12-inches released in the last 20 years-- at least in the neck of the woods where folks are likely to get the Fall and Suicide references. Heck, even \"Give It Up\" rises near the top of DFAs crop of punky dance anthems, and that the second disc appending LCD Soundsystem contains all of this music shows both generosity and considerable foresight on the part of Murphy and DFA.\nHowever, its still debatable whether or not Murphy makes great records. Where the singles emphasize his strengths-- impeccable arrangements (especially his signature drums-plus-drum machine attack), pacing (the dynamic expansion of \"Yeah (Stupid Version)\" is almost unchartable) and the gift of less-is-more-- his debut full-length lacks similar allure for almost the exact same reasons. It doesnt so much have a pace, per se, as nine distinct flavors of the LCD Soundsystem agenda, be it cowbell-ridden dancepunk, homages to any number of 70s and 80s hip rock icons, or rubbery would-be house jams just sloppy enough not to qualify as house. The production is as you would expect-- and therein lies the letdown: There arent very many surprises here, either in the bank of sounds Murphy pulls out, or in how he uses them. Still, that wouldnt be bad if the songs lived up to the promise of his singles. The worst I can say about LCD Soundsystem is that there are precious few moments that stand up next to his most lauded singles.\nBut well start with the best-- which is to say, hell end with the best: \"Great Release\" is a very non-dancefloor number pulled out of the Big Book of Ambient Pop. Beginning with soft, pulsating drum machine pliff, the song glides for more than two minutes using only a stately chord progression on piano before Murphys distant, obviously Eno-cribbed vocal enters. The song builds and builds, in a manner typical of many other LCD Soundsystem songs, but does so via lush echo, like ocean waves, watercolored synthesizers and Murphys \"dat-da-da-da\" harmony vocals near the end. And where \"Great Release\" shines with a symphonic glimmer, \"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\" and \"Disco Infiltrator\" stick to bare-basic LCD pump; yet, theyre just as rewarding. (In fact, \"Disco Infiltrator\" should really have been this albums first single, rather than the comparatively indistinct Fall rip \"Movement\").\n\"Never As Tired As When Im Waking Up\" is a near-brilliant pastiche of both White Album Beatles and Dark Side Floyd, with only its telegraphed George Harrison lead-guitar riff at the end and chord progression ripped from \"Dear Prudence\" keeping it from making as grand an emotional impact as it might. Likewise, \"Too Much Love\" seems just a bit too close to Talking Heads for comfort, though as with all things Murphy, the imitation is masterful. House-centric songs like \"On Repeat\" (a low key take on the structure of \"Yeah\", right down to the disco explosion near the end) and the excellent \"Tribulations\" (which prudent fans will know leaked months ago) should sate the danceheads, though they might have wished for more songs like the latter and some of the fat trimmed from the former. Ultimately, LCD Soundsystem suffers a similar fate: plenty of good-not-great stuff, and a tad unfocused.\n ",

        "article_text": "Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone was among my favorite records from 2002; the debut full-length was warmly luminous, equal parts humility and grandeur. The Walkmen tiptoed where other bands stomp, and if they broke a few eggshells, they did so only when least expected, and in a strangely elegant manner. Their hollow, reverberating guitars and \"cinematic\" atmosphere earned a few apt comparisons to War- or Joshua Tree-era U2-- keyboards arent made that placid, or guitars that jangly, by accident, folks-- but this comparison still strikes me as ridiculous. I might be more willing to accept the parallels had U2 played Christmas music in Vaudeville; I know the songs called \"The Blizzard of 96\", but the last time I heard so many bells was on a sleigh ride to grandmas house.\nThe first album was a process of trial and error, with the desire to make music taking precedence over a clear goal, and even then they were impressive. Now, exactly one infamous car commercial later, The Walkmen find themselves signed to the Jason Dill-affiliated Record Collection label, which means a distribution deal through Warner Bros, and for the first time, a kung-fu grip on their sophisticated, fragile-yet-aggressive aesthetic. Despite the consistency of Everyone, it tended to drift aimlessly through pastoral passages, which were sometimes charming but just as often faceless next to highly structured compositions like the incomparable \"Weve Been Had\", or \"Wake Up\"; on Bows and Arrows, every moment feels deliberate and meaningful.\nBut \"whats in it for me?\" laments Hamilton Leithauser, commiserating with a doleful church organ and trembling, sorry plinks of their now-famously ancient piano, as he opens the album. Well, quite a lot, actually; with so much poised and in place, this is as close to a career-defining moment as any band is likely to have, but if the guys are nervous, they arent letting on. The easy ebb and flow of \"Whats in It for Me?\" is disarmingly comfortable. \"I came here for a good time/ Now youre tellin me to leave/ Well, I heard you the first time,\" he sings, casually prodding that sense of resigned disappointment everyones felt at one time or another, and simultaneously reassuring that itll eventually pass. Maybe the improbable and correspondingly short-lived signing of Jonathan Fire*Eater (elder project of three-out-of-five Walkmen) served as preparation for this moment on the cusp, but their confidence is overwhelming. Their extreme lack of urgency is enthralling, and paradoxically, more of a wake-up call to listeners than any sort of chest-thumping, browbeating assault.\nThe Walkmen refuse to be rushed; they have the acumen to overwhelm, but only when theyre good and ready. Although the delicate sheen of more relaxed numbers like the beautifully faded bar-room regret of \"138th Street\", the supersilent \"Hang On, Siobhan\", or even the comparatively cheerful piano-tinkling of \"New Years Eve\" is impressive, with a focus that would shame most of the interim tracks from Everyone, the few rock standouts are seemingly miles out of their league. The entire record buckles from the force of \"The Rat\"; guitars pound tirelessly forward, and Matt Barricks brilliant, relentless drumming becomes truly demoniacal. Tortured, sleepless, Leithauser screams for retribution, or even simple recognition: \"Cant you hear me when Im calling out your name?\"\n\"The Rat\" could be The Walkmens finest moment, if they didnt immediately surpass it with \"Little House of Savages\", which most clearly demonstrates how immeasurably these guys have tightened as a band. Paul Maroon leads with a cyclical riff as the band unloads their full inventory of aggressive histrionics into the resulting hypnotically tangled mess, like a rock n roll fire sale. Ill even concede that Leithausers voice now actually merits, albeit rarely, an occasional allusion to Bono (if crossed with a gravel pit); when The Walkmen are in full-on assault mode, the vocal comparison doesnt seem quite so silly.\nWith just these two songs, the vast refinement demonstrated on all the comparatively subdued tracks comes dangerously close to being nullified-- its all too easy to overlook the wealth of great material in the massive shadow of just these two songs (the wistful \"Thinking of a Dream\" is energetic, but also pales in comparison), but listen closer: On such a triumphant album, The Walkmen dont succumb to filler. Each of these songs displays a mastery of craft rarely heard, and while not all strike with the same immediacy of its two unbreakable watersheds, each quickly reveals itself as equally forcible and infectious. Beyond this, no grandiose claims warrant stating; Bows and Arrows states them itself.\n ",

        "article_text": "For the first 20 seconds of Mr. M, all the listener will hear is the sound of a string section, gliding, pretty, and warm, like something from an old Disney movie. The strings are followed by brushed, rolling snare drums. Soon, Kurt Wagner, the bands singer, stumbles into the mix. \"Dont know what the fuck they talk about,\" he sings. His voice sounds beery and disoriented. It seems possible that hes in the wrong room.\nComing from some singers, the line might sound like a challenge, but coming from Wagner, its a simple admission. Lambchop is a band that has spent the past 20 years in Nashville building its own idiosyncratic universe. For better and worse, the current state of music, its trends and its innovations, pass them by completely. Even during the days when alt-country seemed like a viable art form, Wagners ornery sense of humor-- the kind that drives you to cap your album with a 40-second-long song called \"I Sucked My Boss Dick\"-- made them seem totally out-of-step with their supposed contemporaries. In a lot of ways, Lambchop is a band that seems committed to its own irrelevance.\nIrrelevance, though, isnt a burden for Lambchop as much as it is a jumping off point for what makes them them. \"I see your Pitchfork I-rock saviors,\" goes one line on 2006s Damaged-- \"Im sorry, I still prefer Jim Nabors.\" If you arent sure who Jim Nabors is and youre still reading our reviews about I-rock saviors, youve unknowingly participated in Wagners self-definition: He hears the conversation going on but damn if hell take part in it.\nNothing on Mr. M is designed to pop, not in the conventional sense of the word. To describe the bands current style is to invoke genres with an almost negative cultural cachet: lounge, 1970s country, Burt Bacharach-- styles so fixated on sounding high-class that they run the risk of feeling trashy. On paper, Lambchop is a band that would appeal primarily to grandparents and drunks.\nWagners voice is a low, wounded-sounding instrument whose character has only deepened with time (though Wagner, in his self-effacing Wagnerian way, has attributed it to cigarettes). At root, hes a crooner, but his croon sounds alternately fragile and gruff-- the elderly neighbor who returns your lost dog one day and commands you to step off his azaleas the next, spittle hanging from his lip.\nHis lyrics are a mix of minor, concrete observations and poetic flights. \"We have crawled among the elements, taking pictures of our phones\" is one. \"Sleep makes you possible\" is another. His writing has the power to transform the everyday into a mystery, but his voice-- and the music behind it-- attempts to transform the mystery into something unplugged and emotionally direct-- to make \"The wine tasted like sunshine in a basement\" sound a little bit like \"I love you.\"\nIf Lambchops music bears some essential ambition, its to marry ambivalence and sentimentality. My favorite turn on Mr. M is on \"Buttons\", a portrait of a small-town loser by a narrator who seems to neither love nor hate the man he sings about. \"Been better times for those that are in trouble,\" Wagner sings, \"and maybe therell be better times for you. The weight youve gained has made your head a bubble, and your button eyes are brown and not her-- black and blue.\"\nOn the last words-- \"black and blue\"-- Wagners voice warps into an almost grotesque croon, like hes either about to giggle or weep over the string section, and yet the image in my head is of a pudgy, small-town loser and the woman who he may or may not have beaten with his own sad fists. What we are supposed to do with these mixed emotional cues, I have no idea. Its to Lambchops credit that their music avoids comfortable resolutions. Instead, it hangs there, no moral, no judgment.\nApprehending Mr. M does not take a genius, nor does it take an English degree, nor does it take 180-gram vinyl and an $800 Scandanavian turntable with counterweights made out of rare geodes. What it does take, I think, is patience. I like tarted-up, throat-grabbing music as much as the next frantically inattentive twentysomething. I also find a deep satisfaction in Lambchops subtlety, which never makes the mistake of thinking that being high-minded or instructive will get us over to their weird team. Nobody, not even the most depraved among us, needs to be slapped on the wrist in order to see beauty. And still, despite Wagners protests that he doesnt know what the fuck they talk about, Mr. M sounds aware of itself as an argument-- an argument for the kind of patience the music on it demands.\nAnd so we return to this idea of Lambchops irrelevance. For the purpose of barroom reductions, Mr. M sounds like a bunch of guys tapping delicately on acoustic instruments from deep within a mausoleum, or the sound of wind blowing gently through the pages of an open book resting on a front-porch rocking chair. But how rare is it that a band asks you to listen to so little, and how much rarer is it that they make it sound like so much?",

        "article_text": "People looking for offhanded symbolism can feel free to try tracking Mos Defs career trajectory as an MC through his album covers. Iconic solo debut Black on Both Sides: a stark, immediately-striking photo portrait that renders the attribution of his name unnecessary. Aggro experimental follow-up The New Danger: that same face now obscured by a stick-up mans mask, his bright red, bloody-looking index fingertip pointing to his own head on some Taxi Driver shit. Contractual obligation mishap True Magic: no actual album art whatsoever, with a blank-looking Mos staring into space off the surface of the disc itself. And now The Ecstatic, which depicts not Mos Def himself but a red-tinted shot from Charles Burnetts classic 1977 film Killer of Sheep. You might go so far as to say this indicates that the best way for Mos Def to reassert what he really means as an artist would be to take his as-seen-in-Hollywood face out of the equation entirely, replacing it with a shot from an entirely different strain of independent, neorealist cinema that more clearly gets at what he represents as a lyricist. Maybe its a stretch, but what the hell.\nAnd while Burnetts Watts isnt quite the same place as Mos Defs Bed-Stuy, it does exist as one of many geographical reference points in The Ecstatics international style. This is Mos Defs small-globe statement, an album that comfortably jumps stylistically across continents on a hip-hop goodwill-ambassador tour, prefaced by a statement from Malcolm X during his 1964 appearance at Oxford: \"I, for one, will join in with anyone, I dont care what color you are, as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.\" Its a high-minded intro for an album that most people will hear first and foremost as the comeback bid of a rapper-turned-actor, but it also serves as an important indication that Mos actually gives a shit here, and that he has a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world.\nIt starts with the production, which originates from assorted French touch cats (Mr. Flash) and Stones Throw siblings (Oh No; Madlib) and the producer from True Magic who actually contributed a couple decentish beats (Preservation). Oh No usefully repurposes some of the Turkish psych from his album Dr. Nos Oxperiment, particularly the massive Selda-sampling acid-rock monster \"Heavy\" for lead track \"Supermagic\". Madlib contributes a couple tracks from his Beat Konducta in India series, diverting in their original form but done real justice by Mos rhythm-sparring flow (and, in the case of \"Auditorium\", Slick Ricks). Ed Banger alum Mr. Flash covers the Caribbean (\"Workers Comp\"), the Middle East (\"Embassy\"), and neon Euro-American club-kid slickness (\"Life in Marvelous Times\"). And Mos own co-production touches in conjunction with Preservations beats drive it all home: \"Quiet Dog\" opens with a defiant Fela Kuti soundbite, \"Casa Bey\" is built off Banda Black Rios samba-funk number \"Casa Forte\", and Mos spends the entirety of \"No Hay Nada Mas\" rapping and singing in Spanish. Theres a good chance youve heard some of this before-- aside from the aforementioned Oh No and Madlib contributions, \"Life in Marvelous Times\" recycles Mr. Flashs beat for \"Champions\", his collaboration with French rappers TTC-- but its not a stale familiarity, at least in the context of The Ecstatics ambitious B-boy diaspora.\nBut it wouldnt mean shit if it felt like the itinerary of a jet-set movie star showing everyone his vacation slides. Fortunately, the good thing about Mos Def not having brought his A Game in a while is that, like many rappers whose reputations have slipped, he was due for a something-to-prove moment. The Ecstatic has a bunch of those, smuggled inside the usual big-up Brooklyn and hip-hop preservationist lyricism and welded-to-the-beat flow that made him shine in 99, and his better turns of phrase have a way of sneaking up on you and smacking you in the back of the head. \"Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren/ I swing round, wring out and bring down the tyrant/ Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided,\" he proclaims on \"Auditorium\" with the kind of delivery that makes the complex and convoluted sound natural. His anti-wack-MC diatribes on \"Quiet Dog\", the gunfight-love narrative of \"Pistola\" and the tone of sardonic but sincere Afrocentrism on \"Revelations\" reveal the versatility he still maintains in his repertoire. And even when hes just rattling off ego-trip riffs, the way he locks into a beat is scary; its kind of hard to notice or care that he mostly keeps repeating the same Mary Poppins-derived hook on \"Supermagic\" when every syllable is like another percussion instrument boosting that head-nod factor by ten.\nThere are still some moments of weird, dope-hazy fuck-around on Mos part, and while they dont really distract to the point where they test your patience, the frequent times when he drops into quasi-aimless sing-song vamping-- or straight-up attempted singing-- give The Ecstatic the feeling of a weeded-out jam session that didnt always go entirely according to plan and somehow fell together anyways. Still, its the kind of fucking around thats clearly coming from a dude who sounds liberated, and a lot of it-- like the outro in \"Pistola\" where he interpolates the Intruders \"Cowboys to Girls\" over some Madlib-provided vibes and King Tubby cookie-sheet-smacking percussion, or the casually amped dont stop the rock/cant keep me down declarations of closing track \"Casa Bey\"-- is too damn joyous to feel over-indulgent. Even absurd stuff like the Spanish track and his cod-reggae delivery on \"Workers Comp\" (try not to crack up the first time you hear the way he sings \"fie-yerd\" in the chorus) are more eccentric than bad. And anyone who wants to complain about those, well, go enjoy \"History\" instead: Its a Black Star reunion over a Dilla beat. Looks like we finally got the Mos Def we were waiting for.",

        "article_text": "Theres a high you get from the classic 1970s \"art-rock\" of Yes, Genesis, or King Crimson-- and when it hits, theres nothing like it. Im not talking about the way other music peaks, like a dance track where the beat kicks in and the crowd goes berzerk, or metal music that gets louder and louder until your skull caves, or gutbucket singers who can make your heart jump out of your chest. With art-rock, theres a lot of mumbo-jumbo and funny time signatures, and sometimes theres like 10 or 15 minutes of really boring shit (see: Yes, \"Awaken\"). But when the \"good part\" hits? Holy shit-- the band crescendos and the singer, smooth as silk but loud as God, rams Buddha down the throat of a giant silver dragon. If I sound like Im growing a mullet, Ive done my job.\nDeerhoof, an indie band who have released plenty of discombobulated pop and no wave albums, have lately turned toward accessible, foot-stomping rock. It worked on The Runners Four, but it works better and quicker on their new album, Friend Opportunity. Weve been using the term \"inde prog\" mostly to describe bands that quick-cut between ideas and construct mini-suites out of mini-songs. But on this record Deerhoof take everything that clique of indie bands has worked toward-- add the suddenly popular twee vocals-- and ride it like an h-bomb.\nIf it werent for Satomi Matsuzakis little-girl voice, this music would be demagoguery: concussive beats, stabbing horn fills, pounding drums, a guitar chord that lands like a 10-ton weight on a 20-ton trampoline. Ive never been more aware of the attack of an electric piano. And while a new love of knob-twiddling and loop-peddling brings more tonal colors, theyre here for percussion, not atmosphere.\nI didnt even want to make out all the words, in case Id screw up the Obi Wan-spanks-Zelda Heros Journey I had in my head in tracks one through nine. Snatches of story-like lyrics-- the stage-setting of \"The Perfect Me\", the flashes of conflict, warnings that \"Its a trap\"-- imply a narrative arc, with a detour for a new character on \"Cast Off Crown\", drummer Greg Sauniers sole vocal performance and a mini-epic that crams introduction, exposition, and resolution into three minutes.\nThe rest of the vocals are held down again by the high, heavily-accented singing of Matsuzaki. And the more song-like Deerhoofs music gets, the more obviously she becomes a barrier to new fans. The bleep-bloop speak-singing of \"Kidz are So Small\" seems to be the dealbreaker-- like you shouldnt take anything so sweet and cute seriously. (Listen to that gristly bleep in the background: thats a fucking droid, dude.) But wait til you hear the climactic \"Matchbook Seeks Maniac\": Jesus, Matsuzaki is the homecoming queen from Saturn, complete with silver glitter makeup and hip-side death ray. She rides the albums peak in the main chorus-- \"I would sell my soul to the devil/ If I could be the top of the world\"-- and when she belts the title phrase? It makes me quail.\nOnly thing is, after that 24-minute binge we get the 12-minute hangover of \"Look Away\". Like a rambling, shapeless homage to Yes \"Sound Chaser\", its listenable and it has a great instrumental traffic jam at the midpoint, but on this record its just an appendix. All of a sudden the band is back to silences and blank stares, sustained tones and reverbed guitars. Theyre \"deconstructing pop,\" which means theyre asking questions. But on Friend Opportunity, Deerhoof work best when they blast right to the answers.",

        "article_text": "When Iceage released their excellent 2011 debut, New Brigade, a large part of the discussion was dedicated to the nihilistic but crush-worthy Danish punk groups ages (at the time, ranging from 18 to 19), and the fact that they sounded much older than that. You also got stories about their bloody live shows and, later, online handwringing about them baiting controversy Joy Division-style by apparently flirting with fascist gestures at one of those shows. In the beginning, though, people were most interested in the part about four young dudes exploding out of \"nowhere\" (the Copenhagen DIY scene) fully formed and going on to release one of the best punk collections in recent memory. Their shows during that time were powerful in a very messy, very punk way. Two years later, theyre a different band, one capable of more than shambling atmospherics and stage dives. Iceage write brilliant songs; on Youre Nothing, theyve found a way to clarify these compositional skills without stripping away their power.\nIceages self-produced second album is even better than their debut. Its the quartets first offering for the larger label Matador (the albums still being released by Escho in Denmark) and they come off even wilder and more chaotic than they did in 2011, but also more experienced and nuanced. Theyve honed the uncanny sense of classic punk songwriting-- the guitar sounds huge, the hooks more present, the charisma of dead-eyed, out-of-breath vocalist Elias Bender Rønnenfelt even greater. When you listen to the two records in tandem, you realize how brittle New Brigade was: \"brittle\" in an excellently fuzzed, rancid way, but Youre Nothing is a heftier experience.\nUnlike some groups who sign to a bigger label and beef up their sound in the wrong ways, Iceage used the new resources to hone what they already did well without abandoning what made them interesting in the first place. You can hear the shift on the industrial/ambient instrumental \"Interlude\", which helps to make Nothing darker and danker, and on \"Morals\", a mid-tempo piano-flecked track based on the 1960s Italian singer Minas \"LUltima Occasione\". The odd reference fits here, building into a frenzy that finds Rønnenfelt hoarsely screaming \"Wheres your morals?\" over militaristic rhythms. And, even with these slight tweaks, they dont fuck around: New Brigade offered 12 songs in 24 minutes, Youre Nothing 12 songs in 28-and-a-half.\nOn the more typical Iceage songs, you get their mix of dirty punk and pulsing hardcore wrapped in an ink-black atmosphere, and Rønnenfelts existential musings come in more powerful doses. The brilliant opener \"Ecstasy\", which sounds like a punk anthem mid-melt, strings together furious tempo changes, with, Rønnenfelt howling \"I cant take this pressure\" in the final implosion. \"Coalition\" is a classic rager, but youve never heard them doing doubled Sonic Youth guitar hooks like this. From \"In Haze\"s clipped and twangy d-beat to the heavy bass of \"Everything Drifts\" to the spiraling anthemics of the title track, there are no weak spots. They chiseled things down for a reason: Great punk comes in spurts.\nRønnenfelt has said Youre Nothing was inspired in part by his readings of Bataille, Genet, and the like. On these off-kilter anthems, you also imagine them reading Rimbaud, and get the sense that the group has taken Richard Hell and the Voidoids \"Blank Generation\" to heart with lines like the title tracks \"Thats right, youre nothing/ Feel the void grow\" and \"Ecstasy\"s \"But bliss is momentary anyhow/ Yet worth living for,\" along with the romantic surrealism of lines like \"If I could/ Leave my body then I would/ Bleed into a lake/ Dashing away/ Disappear\" from from \"Morals\". These are the sentiments of early 70s NYC punk made by kids who can look back on hardcore and post-punk to add fuel to it.\nThere was a moment at last years Pitchfork Festival in Chicago that crystallized part of what makes Iceage fascinating: During their set, a bass head blew, then another, and then another. This is something that would usually cause a group to apologize, or blush, or throw a tantrum. But Iceage kept playing, didnt seem to sweat it, and calmly did their thing until someone else fixed the problem. Bassist Jakob Tvilling Pless looked around and shrugged it off. Rønnenfelt also kept going. In a way, it hardly registered. (Blank Generation, indeed.) It was my favorite moment of the weekend, and the most real: Iceage are a band who do these things honestly, and without thinking too much about it, and thats a big part of their power. That they back the attitude up with songs of this quality is what makes them unstoppable on Youre Nothing.",

        "article_text": "Rhyes short history is marked by serendipity and mystery. A couple of years ago, after being tapped by Hannibals Copenhagen-based electronic group Quadron, producer/vocalist Mike Milosh flew to Denmark to work with the group and they hit it off. Eventually, Quadron producer Robin Hannibal moved to L.A. in pursuit of a woman, and Milosh coincidentally relocated there as well, and started his own serious relationship (which has since evolved into a marriage) before they reconnected musically.\nFrom what Milosh has said, Rhyes primary goal is to pay tribute to this type of world-tilting romantic experience, but so far the pair have delivered their interpretations of this very personal phenomenon from behind a veil of secrecy. They released their first single, \"Open\", anonymously, and promoted it in a deliberately opaque fashion, like a YouTube video of Milosh serenading his wife with a solo piano rendition of the song, shot in a way where you can barely make him out in silhouette. Even after revealing their identities, the pair refuse to say where the groups name comes from or what it means, and their full names dont appear anywhere in the liner notes to their debut album, Woman.\nEven without a face to attach it to, Rhyes music itself feels deeply intimate. Much of this comes from Hannibal and Miloshs deft arrangements-- each of Womans 10 songs makes its point with a bare minimum of moving parts. Beats, basslines, and Miloshs voice are at the center of nearly all of them; although a majority of the tracks boast arrangements for horns and strings, most of these are so subtle that you might not even realize theyre there until you read the liner notes afterward. The lean production leaves little space between the listener and the songs, and they feel almost touchably close.\nAnd then of course theres Miloshs voice itself, a gorgeous and graceful countertenor that many listeners have mistaken for a womans, especially in the days before the group unmasked themselves. Hes a subtle performer, but also canny. The restraint that the pair shows in their arrangements also carries over to his singing, which rarely rises above the volume of a conversation. Its gentle, soothing, and easy to get lost in.\nThat voice has drawn a number of comparisons to Sade, and the music behind it only underlines those similarities. Woman offers few sounds or ways of deploying them that wouldnt be familiar to an R\u0026B fan in the 90s, especially if they were into the British wing of the genre that at the time was focused on making gently bumping, slightly jazzy bedroom music.\nAnd although Milosh is an outspoken critic of what he considers a trend of crass sexualization in pop music, the album still embraces the physical aspects of the romantic experience it intends to glorify. Its sensual aspects may share the same sense of self-control (its sexy without being overtly sexual, erotic but not lascivious). As well-mannered as its carnal side may be, Woman is bound to become fodder for a tasteful boudoir soundtrack, something to be slotted next to the xx, another band Rhyes been frequently compared to.\nThe satin-sheets sensuality and Miloshs vocals are impressive enough that they could save an otherwise unremarkable album, but the pair are also gifted songwriters who seem even stronger as a pair than as they did separately. Woman has only one bad song on it, though it should be noted that its seriously bad: \"One of Those Summer Days\" is boring and hook-free, and it not only dives face-first into the kind of sickly cloying sentimentality that they studiously avoid on the rest of the songs, but does so to the accompaniment of a drippy smooth-jazz alto sax solo.\nBut a good number of the remaining songs come breathtakingly close to their own kind of perfection, at least close enough that its hard to imagine how anyone could improve them. \"Open\" may be so derivative of Sade that you may as well call it an homage, but considering that the closest point of comparison would be Sades \"By Your Side\"-- one of the few truly perfect songs in pop history-- thats hardly a complaint. And Id be surprised if Justin Timberlake and the members of Phoenix arent holding their new singles up to the lithe, clean-lined modern disco sound of \"The Fall\" and frowning at the results.\nMusic about happy, successful relationships is always a tougher sell than music about romance gone bad, for the same reason that tragedies are more compelling than stories where everything works out fine for everyone. Bad fortune is naturally fascinating and contentment isnt, and unless youre in a happy, successful relationship you dont want to hear about someone elses. But Woman somehow gets to break those rules, in large part because the music itself is so easy to fall in love with.",

        "article_text": "Autre Ne Veuts self-titled debut was the epitome of fringe back in 2010: someone with an unwieldy handle and a staunch commitment to anonymity making warped approximations of 1980s and 90s R\u0026B on a label that primarily trafficked in lo-fi curiosities. By the time Arthur Ashin revealed himself in 2012, all of those characteristics had become basic tools of indie rock buzzmaking. Though prevailing trends have positioned Autre Ne Veut closer to the center of discussion, he remains quite outré on new album Anxiety. The cover no longer bears a replication of Edvard Munchs The Scream, but he kept Anxiety as the album title; you cant say he didnt warn you about him losing his cool time and time again on his marvelous and moving second LP.\nWhile by far his most accessible work to date, Ashins busy hands keep Anxiety off-kilter throughout. The touches of dissonance help convey the message of each song: brash sax honks evoke the morbid discomfort of \"Counting\"; the yearning \"Dont Ever Look Back\" hitches on sharp feedback before giving into harmonized hair-metal guitars; as \"Play by Play\" restlessly prepares for its massive chorus, Ashins voice is layered and deformed with sudden fits of pitch-shifting. While Ashins past as a jingle writer manifests in focusing every song with a melody that sticks, theyre not the kind of tunes I imagine being belted out by the kids chorus at PS 22. His melodic sense feels more intuitive, looping and darting perilously. They can initially come off as harsh before the warmth courses through; repeat the experience four or five times and you might want to go hug someone.\nThat much is played out in Anxietys bookends, songs that are structured to deliver tremendous codas with extremely different effects. Opener \"Play by Play\" has a \"Purple Rain\"-like gospel build, as oddly juxtaposed harmonies rising and crashing with every round; its conceivable that Anxiety could buckle under the weight of its impact after only five minutes. The comparatively sedate closer \"World War\" fizzles into electronic static mid-way through, easing out into a resigned duet that thematically connects with \"Play by Play\" to give Anxiety a sense of cycle. The message of \"Play by Play\" was \"dont ever leave me alone,\" on \"World War,\" he pleads, \"no way youll ever be my baby.\"\nIn between, that polarity of desire and disappointment is fully explored by Ashins erratic and ecstatic voice. Describing its tone doesnt quite convey its appeal, nor does it demonstrate how much of an acquired taste it is. His glass-shattering falsetto runs and chesty bleats transform Anxiety from a great pop record into something powerfully therapeutic, more about casting off inhibitions than actually hitting those high notes.\nIts the sort of performance typically ascribed to the hyper-emotive subgenres of rock, so its no surprise it works splendidly on unhinged songs like \"Ego Free Sex Free\" and \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\". The latter doesnt quote Whitney Houston like his recent solo rendition of \"World War\" did; he simply captures the unchecked desires conveyed in the title. The enduring surprise of Anxiety is that Ashins nervy approach works just as well on the ballads, his voice lending an edge to songs that might otherwise slip into filler territory. His performance is toned down only somewhat on \"A Lie\", \"Gonna Die\", and \"World War\", the titles of which give you an idea of the phenomenal stakes Ashin can create vocally. Theres sadness in these songs, certainly-- but while they sound like slow dances, they feel like the entire universe caving in on Ashin.\nIt could certainly be a turn-off, or at least criticized as \"oversinging.\" But the demonstrative nature of Autre Ne Veut is pretty much the point, and as with collaborator and peer How to Dress Well, it has as much in common with Broadway as it does with R\u0026B; you imagine hes drawn to this style of music because its a means to a kind of spiritual transcendence that most rock music isnt particularly interested in. So its understandable that \"Ego Free Sex Free\" becomes something of a mantra for Anxiety. On its face, its a curious slogan-- typically, we prefer pop stars to indulge in ego and certainly avail themselves of carnality. But judging from Ashins explanation regarding the songs inspiration, you can see what he means by it, how the neediness of the self can stand in the way of true and meaningful connection. Yes, its completely corny and Im pretty sure its the reasoning behind every nudist colony. And yet, it fits within the context of Anxiety, an album where Ashin fearlessly reveals himself as a person and an artist and dares you to open up in the same way.",

        "article_text": "How to Dress Well is a project that Tom Krell conducts with a particularly modern transparency: the music he shares is meant to illuminate the music that he makes. His most recent Soundcloud mixtapes, No Words to Say and I Think Life Might Be Elsewhere (Hungover Mix), were heavy on what we’ve come to expect from him—along with his own work in progress, we’d hear a very specific set of influences, mostly R\u0026B and hip-hop, high/lowbrow dichotomies accepted by indie culture such as Lou Reed and Miley Cyrus, Young Thug, and GG Allin. But late last year, early 2000s emo acts like the Starting Line, Taking Back Sunday and Saves the Day started to infiltrate, and surely he was trying to tell us why these bands speak to him. Whether it’s Chief Keef or Chris Conley, Krell is informed by genre but driven by expression; in his mind, pop music is anything that aspires for the most immediate and impactful connection, even if it risks embarrassment in the process. As a result, his transcendent third LP \"What Is This Heart?\" is a pop album of the highest caliber.\nIt’s easy to be skeptical, as he once treated mainstream music like an academic—pop rendered as ambient and insular experiences. His 2010 debut Love Remains didnt sound like anything else and still doesn’t, as if William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loops were filled with cuts from early 90s R\u0026B. Its follow-up Total Loss was sleek and solemn salon-soul, interpolating Ashanti but still modeled by outré, experimental artists ranging from Proem to Forest Swords to Steve Reich. The dubious term “indie R\u0026B” already projected a degree of otherness on a white man in a primary black genre, and Krell’s egghead influences and agamous lyrics gave his detractors plenty of additional dirt.\nBut even in 2010, it should’ve been fairly obvious that grad students and grade schoolers alike can dream of being Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown or Beyoncé. Krell told us recently, “I want my music to be pop, but not populist—I want to be #1 on Billboard, but I want to do it on my own terms.” Previously, that might’ve smacked of indie defeatism, of wanting to be admired for sticking to his guns by contrasting it against an impossible scenario. But in 2014, unique and truly weird polyglot R\u0026B/pop records like Beyoncé, Channel Orange and Kaleidoscope Dream have achieved runaway commercial, critical, and artistic success. It’s completely within Krell’s rights to ask, “why not me?”\nSo, here, Krell lets the music catch up with his extroverted candor, combining emotional risk and artistic confidence to figure out just how far How to Dress Well can go while retaining the projects essence. In retrospect, Krell’s albums sound as tentative and sketchbook as his mixtapes, as nearly everything on “What Is This Heart?” is a bolder, more accomplished version of what came before. \"2 Years On (Shame Dream)” reiterates Krells taste for unseemly reverie, as a car ride with his family turns both surreal and hyperreal, its ache presented in startling clarity—Tracy Chapman may have been on his mind as a starting point for bare, acoustic folk, but he needed to cover the uber-emo “At Your Funeral” over a Crash of Rhinos instrumental on his Hungover Mix to realize he was capable of doing it. “What You Wanted” pressurizes the subdued militance and tension of “Cold Nites” and releases it in the monstrous, pitch-shifted vocals that deface “Face Again”. The orchestral ambitions of the Just Once EP and the redlining distortion of Love Remains are removed from their headphone-intended origins and given concert hall ambience on “Pour Cyril\".\nThe stylistic range of “What Is This Heart?” lends credence to Krell’s “pop, but not populist” ambitions—if he was to make a superproducer-per-song, blockbuster album, this is how it would likely turn out. However, Rodaidh McDonald returns to produce and retains the stained glass sound of Total Loss: bright, translucent, and nowhere near as brittle as it may first appear. More importantly, Krell’s voice is made the focal point rather than a texture. His singing can be parodied at this point, meaning that its something established as clearly his own: demonstrative and inclusive as good karaoke, not performative in a way that’s meant to be judged. It’s spiritual, though more borne of a monastic purity than a specific religion. And now, it’s only distorted as a signature punctuation rather than using the effect as a white-out slather.\nKrell makes it known that hes got chops, the kind that can handle the physical challenges of “What Is This Heart?”’s pop rites of passage—“Words I Don’t Remember” aspires for the “Purple Rain” extended coda, Krell’s wavering, breathless coo reverbed and distended to emulate an emotive, showstopping guitar solo. L.A. Reid should’ve desperately tried to smuggle the effervescent disco-pop of “Repeat Pleasure” onto Xscape and if there was every a doubt that a HTDW song could be a legitimate smash hit rather than a deconstruction of one, there’s the arena-R\u0026B of “Precious Love”, which tags on a gorgeous, unexpected key change that lasts about ten seconds just to stunt.\nIn the true spirit of How to Dress Well, “What Is This Heart?” is comprehensive and referential, littered with bits and pieces of the music that’s moved him over the years. “Words I Don’t Remember” teases its lyrical cold war with the milky chords of Diana Ross’ “Missing You”; Beyoncés declaratory “to the left” cadence from “Irreplaceable” is utilized to express Krell’s apposite desire “to relate, to relate” on \"Precious Love\". Meanwhile, the spirit of “Very Best Friend” is so plainspoken and eternal that it has to be some roller rink obscurity from his youth, the source of which Krell is keeping from us all.\nFor the duration of How to Dress Well’s existence, Krell’s obsessive devotion to pop music has served as a connection he can trust, as he lowers himself into the depths of unanswerable questions about spirituality and death. While that love remains, Krell’s breakthrough on \"What Is This Heart?\" is a staggering paradox: as long as he holds onto that tether, he’ll probably never get to the bottom.\nWhile Krell is sometimes still that college freshman listening to Jimmy Eat World with a “Childhood Faith in Love”, he writes about love like the philosophy Ph.D. student that he is—much of this album recognizes a pop cultural paradigm where love is presented as a panacea, the single most important thing a person can acquire. But the problem is that it’s so often conveyed through consumer products that love becomes one itself—something meant to be obtained, consumed, and replaced, a simple prop to occupy one’s time.\nKrell recognizes his own complicitly in this situation both as a human and as someone who makes pop songs in How to Dress Well. The first words of “Words I Don’t Remember” are, distressingly, “You know that I love you, baby”, and he confesses with palpable guilt, \"Said it was you for the rest of our lives\", referring to the joyous centerpiece of Total Loss.  “\u0026 It Was U” was indicative of how the brief flickers of happiness on past HTDW albums only served to remind you of the surrounding, oppressive presence of death and depression. Though \"What Is This Heart?\" is by far Krell’s lightest, most melodic album, his lyrics are constantly prodding at a pervasive societal problem: a mistrust of intimacy, fear of legitimate connection, the idea of romance as a competitive sport.\nBut if you think this is some kind of grad-level treatise, remember that the title of this album is phrased as a question. Krell’s pain and pleasure is borne of in situ struggle—do you say just what you want and when you want it in pursuit of an honest relationship, knowing that your most honest moments can be wicked? That’s the cruel irony at the center of “Repeat Pleasure”, where the title doesnt instantly reveal its cynical view of sex. What initially sounds like a glittery valentine becomes a \"Dear John\"-in-waiting, as Krell realizes our tendencies to get caught up in routine:\"I say theres no one above you/ But now theres a new place above that line.…Even if youre holding on for something unchanging/ And once you got it youll want something else.\" “What You Wanted” similarly provokes people who see others hot love and emotion fade rather than continuing endlessly and assume that the same wont happen to them: \"Said I know that I want it/ Know that as soon as Ive got it/ Itll change, Ill hate it.\"  Later, on \"A Power\", Krell seeks sympathy and serenity rather than carnality; during a tribal, percussive breakdown and his most intense vocal performance, he sings with desperate joy, that if he doesnt share his desire to \"loved and lost in all directions\", hell be sucked into, \"dark, silence and the void\".\nSimilar to Ezra Koenig, Krell can be the smartest guy in the room by having the best questions and the least amount of answers, and \"What is This Heart?\" does share important commonalities with the intellectually sound spiritual awakening of Modern Vampires of the City—their creators have always met their dull accusations of appropriation head on, and on their resepective third albums, they make them a moot point by completely upstaging the iffy subgenre they’re largely responsible for. Yes, “indie R\u0026B” was always a condescending genre tag for unclassifiable music, but it did help focus attention on the increasing interaction between big-budget pop and the sort of recording tactics that almost always resulted in would-be Guided By Voices and Ariel Pinks. Krell asserts that Love Remains does deserve credit for changing the trajectory of indie music in the new decade, still noting that, “while everyone was praising the underground and the overground coming together, somehow that turned into there not being any underground music.\"\nAnd he’s right: “indie R\u0026B” ended up being just as stylized, hyped and victim to fashion as the big league stuff. This hasn’t been the direct cause of so many listeners rediscovering things like Sun Kil Moon in 2014, but it sure isn’t a fucking coincidence. Nor are the major influences of “What Is This Heart?”, an album that shames most of its peers musically and reveals that what the game’s been missing is, y’know, heart. Know damn well, if you love this album, you will be mocked for it, and soon—because one of its singles crests on a falsetto cry of, “even broken my heart will go on!”, and because there’s a song called “Childhood Faith in Love (Everything Must Change, Everything Must Stay the Same)”.\nAnd it’s because like any vaccine to a ubiquitous illness, \"What Is This Heart?\" makes you initially susceptible and vulnerable, and that’s risky when modern discourse seeks metaphorical blood, allowing people to disclose more than ever without actually revealing anything. So make no mistake, the title of this album is a challenge as well, as How to Dress Well’s modern masterpiece is conducted with the most eternal transparency—Krell asks “what is this heart” and lets you look right into his own.",

        "article_text": "The biggest lie about punk rock is that anyone can do it. Sure, anyone can do crap punk rock, but there is a fine to art to taking a music fueled by destructive impulses and building it to last. Toronto power trio Metz played their first show in late 2007, and since then, theyve effectively applied Malcolm Gladwells theory about the Beatles-- i.e., that it takes a good 10,000 hours of practice to become them-- to a subgenre not exactly known for its studiousness: post-hardcore sludge-punk. That five-year gap between their live and recorded debuts is not a product of laziness, but rather precision; while Metz quickly established themselves as the most brutalizing band in the city, the process of translating that essence into a record that would sound every bit as devastating and disorienting outside the confines of a circle pit was more protracted and deliberate. After a couple of small-run 7\"s, and a series of sessions helmed by producers including Owen Pallett/Dusted associate Leon Taheny, Crystal Castles engineer Alex Bonenfant, and Graham Walsh of Holy Fuck, theyve distilled their set-list standards into 29 minutes of pure but artfully rendered chaos.\nFrom Cloud Nothings In Uterod pop-punk to Japandroids Superchunk-gone-Springsteen heroics to the Mens My Bloody Dinosaur overdrive, 2012 has seen no lack of artists revamping 1990s-vintage indie rock with a more anthemic accessibility and better mastering jobs. Metz pull off the same trick, but work with more angular, insoluble materials: namely, the muscular menace of the Jesus Lizard and the relentless, power-drill discord of Drive Like Jehu. Metz songs tend to start with an isolated element-- Hayden Menzies thundering, hammer-of-the-gods drum salvos, Alex Edkins solitary guitar screech-- that immediately triggers a ticking time-bomb countdown for the moment when the band erupts in unison. You can see the storm coming from a mile atway, and yet, when Menzies, Edkins, and bassist Chris Slorach launch into the merciless, firestorm battering of \"Negative Space\" or the wrecking-ball swing of \"Knife in the Water\", it still startles like a sneak attack.\nBut while it ably captures the bands ferocity, Metz is less a recreation of the bands live shows than a surveillance-video document of it, one thats been edited and manipulated to maximize dynamic impact. Theres a surface graininess that amplifies the corrosive qualities of the bands sound and the strep-throat rawness of Edkins voice, but also serves to accentuate some of the more surprising elements in the mix-- like the ascendant \"ahhhhh\" harmonies that provide a two-second respite from the village-pillaging assault of \"Headache\". The title of that song and others like \"Rats\", \"Nausea\", and \"Sad Pricks\" provide a handy summation of Edkins bleak lyrical concerns, but that misanthropy never weighs the album down. Instead, like a pre-fame Kurt Cobain, Edkins channels his anxieties into manic release with a certain insolent swagger: In \"Wasted\", you get a glimpse of what Nirvana wouldve sounded like had they recorded their follow-up to Bleach for Touch and Go instead of Geffen.\nThough unafraid to temper their inherent ugliness with piano taps and tambourine shakes, Metz stop short of embracing traditional pop-song melody. But they do understand pop-song economy, carefully arranging their riffs, rhythms, and screams in two-to-three-minute bursts that still feel immediate and catchy in the absence of proper sing-along hooks. Live, \"Wet Blanket\"s psych-damaged fuzz-bass breakdown often gets stretched out, \"You Made Me Realise\"-style; on record, it emerges as a tightly wound beast, with a white-knuckled finale that craftily blurs the line between the bands natural, primal energy and studio-tweaked trickery. Recent history is rife with home-recording prodigies who get thrust onto the stage before learning how to perform, or promising live acts who rush-release their albums so that they have something to sell at the merch table, or at least a Soundcloud link to pimp. But while evidence suggests great concerts and great records are becoming mutually exclusive ideals for aspiring artists, Metz prove that, with a little patience, you can still have it both ways.",

        "article_text": "When I was in high school a friend drove a 1970 Impala that his gearhead dad had kept garaged for years. The radio was AM-only, and as luck would have it, reception was poor and the only station it could pull was Lansing, Mich.s version of the \"Golden Oldies\" format. Oldies, yes, these were the songs to hear in this car. Tooling through the streets while listening to pop singles from the late 1950s and early 60s through that factory-original system, the production of the era made perfect sense. Songs like the Flamingos \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" or the Associations \"The Time it Is Today\", with all their lush reverb, opened up the single in-dash speaker and kept us in the middle of the music as if it was Dolby 5.1. Those producers knew exactly what they were doing.\nReverb gives the illusion of immersion, and immersion is what the Clientele is all about. Singer and guitarist Alasdair Maclean writes songs that work like songs are supposed to, but Ive no desire to hear them covered by another artist. Clientele songs are bound tightly to the performance and production; to separate them would destroy the effect. Still, the bands signature sonic trick-- laying a thick coating of reverb Macleans voice in tribute to the AM radio production of the 60s-- has in a sense been isolating; such a relentless stylization is bound to turn away some people.\nTheres a subtle shift in that regard here on Strange Geometry, the Clienteles second full-length. The reverb is toned down considerably, strings have been added (courtesy of Louis Philippe), and the album as a whole is more direct and focused. This clarity foregrounds Macleans songwriting talent, a poetic ear tuned into a more surreal world, with darker images bumping against the bucolic scenes of records past. The music retains its easy tunefulness, but inside many of the songs lurks a desperation that seems new to the Clientele world. \"Crowds pulled you away, through the ribbons and the rain, and the ivy coiled around my hands\" in \"(I Cant Seem To) Make You Mine\". And then on the catchy mid-tempo \"E.M.P.T.Y.\", Maclean sings, \"Driving west, now half past five/ My skin is cut, my hands are knives.\"\nOn previous Clientele records loneliness and romantic longing led to a hyper-aware state of quiet contemplation; here theres a vague suggestion of underlying violence. \"The crowd\" is mentioned throughout Strange Geometry but the narrator never seems part of it. Instead he wanders the streets seeing things--lifeless bodies in doorways, his own face inside trees-- that may or may not be there. Passages of blissed-out musical haiku like Suburban Lights \"6 am Morningside\" or The Violet Hours \"Haunted Melody\" are nowhere to be found.\nIts not right to play up the differences too much, though; this is in most respects a classically \"Clientele\" record. The primary differences can be found by comparing the version of \"Impossible\" from last years Ariadne EP with the one released here. On the former, Macleans voice sounds like its been bounced off the ionosphere an ocean away, and the bands instruments sound pinched and aged. The Strange Geometry version begins with a stately string arrangement as a lead-in to a much meatier sound, while sticking with the same basic arrangement. The slight nods to accessibility and the decreased stylization might disappoint some of the faithful at first, but Strange Geometry grows more appealing with repeated listening. On the whole, Strange Geometry does a better job than The Violet Hour translating the Clienteles aesthetic, which lends itself easily to the single or EP, to the demands of a full-length record. One of todays most consistently wonderful bands has kept up its long winning streak.\n ",

        "article_text": "When Cults \"Go Outside\" first appeared on the web last year, it spread like wildfire. It was catchy and sweet, the kind of sing-along that felt like it was pulled from the air, with a sentiment perfect for anyone stuck in an office or addicted to the Internet. But how many communal sing-alongs can a band make before the approach goes stale? Cults have opted not to find out. \"Go Outside\" is on their debut album, and it still gives you your entire recommended daily allowance of vitamin D, but its dreamy drift is just one side of a band that proves it has the dexterity and songwriting chops to make a varied and memorable album.\nMuch has been made about the speed with which Cults signed to Columbia, as if theyre the first group to release a debut album on a major. That kind of rapid ascent isnt anything new, but the speculation that came with it-- online chatter pronouncing them destined for the one-hit-wonder bin-- now looks grossly off the mark. At the center of the bands appeal is singer Madeline Follins youthful alto. She has a tone that creates the impression youre listening to a precocious tween fronting a band well versed in Phil Spectors Back to Mono and three decades of climactic indie pop. The 1960s girl-pop element of their sound is pretty evident on the surface-- \"You Know What I Mean\" even borrows its verse melody from the Supremes \"Where Did Our Love Go\"-- but what theyve done with it is pure 21st century, cutting it with synths, guitars, and softly integrated samples.\nThe samples, of cult leaders speaking to their followers, could have been a distraction had they chosen to make a big deal out of them, but theyre woven tightly into the albums sonic fabric and processed to varying degrees of decipherability, which turns them into an effective textural element. Those voices bounce around in the intro to \"Oh My God\", originally released last year as part of Adult Swims singles program, but subtly remixed for the LP. The music hasnt changed here but the beat is amped up, and the bass has been moved forward in the mix, giving the song a much more powerful groove to support its melody. And if Follins lyrics arent necessarily deep-- \"I can run away and leave you anytime/ Please dont tell me you know the plans for my life\"-- she delivers them with relatable and affecting conviction.\nThis taps into a vein of petulance that runs through the album. \"I dont need anyone else,\" from \"Never Saw the Point\", may read as a tossed-off line, but in a strangely positive way, it feels like the records main message. Even the eternally sunny \"Go Outside\" ends on the lyric, \"I think I want to live my life and youre just in my way.\" These are teenage sentiments, the kind of things you feel dumb for saying and thinking once youve navigated into your mid-twenties, but theyre also universal sentiments during that stage of life when youre trying to figure out what kind of person youre going to be. Cults use of elements borrowed from traditionally teen music-- girl groups, 50s prom-pop, bedroom indie pop-- plays along with the lyrics to create a little world where one minute Follin is singing a frustrated \"fuck you\" (\"Never Heal Myself\") and dreaming of escaping the next. Even the more formal pop explorations play to teen melodrama. The surging Spector pop of the records anthemic opener \"Abducted\" compares falling in love to being kidnapped, and gives the other Cult, Brian Oblivion, a brief lead vocal to play the abductor.\nAt just over a half hour, Cults feels like the perfect length-- just long enough for the bus ride to school (or to work). But more importantly, it executes what it sets out to do masterfully while allowing the group room to grow and mature. Theyve also set themselves up to take their sound and subject matter in any number of possible directions in the future, and thats a good position for a young band to find itself in. Cults built up a lot of goodwill last year on the strength of just three tracks; on their debut album, theyve rewarded it.",

        "article_text": "Tim Hecker’s first album under his own name was called Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again. This was 2001: Ambient and electronic music was still ruled by the penetrating austerity of labels like Mille Plateaux and Raster-Noton—labels whose artists strove to make their music sound as digital as possible. Markus Popps Oval, which inspired a lot of supposedly funny comments about whether or not its CDs were skipping, is still probably the best example of this—and in an era where CDs are starting to go the way of the public pay phone, probably the most quaint, too.\nFrom its title down, Haunt Me presented a model of electronic music that was spectral, imperfect, and capable of erosion. The most applicable metaphors for it weren’t technological, but natural: Parts of the album sounded like the slow tearing of paper, other parts like wind blowing across infinities of sand. Hecker didn’t just imbue his computers with “warmth”—a lazy term that has long needed to be put down—but with mortality. (Remember that that this was 2001, a year after the Y2K scare made supposedly infallible stores of digital information look vulnerable in a very human way.) At the time, Haunt Me’s most obvious companion was Fennesz’s Endless Summer, a grainy, blissful album that resembles easy-listening music coming through on the broken broadcast of a distant star.\nHecker has more or less followed course for the past 12 years, releasing high-quality albums with the low-key consistency of someone apparently unconcerned with trend. His approach to sound and texture can be traced to mid-2000s Radiohead, the ominous holding patterns of Godspeed You! Black Emperor (fellow Canadians with which Hecker has toured), William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loops, and basically any music that sounds like it has been abandoned by its maker to rot. His peaks are arguable: My favorites are 2006’s Harmony in Ultraviolet (his most conventionally beautiful) and 2011’s Ravedeath, 1972, which was built out of a single session of live organ, piano and guitar, recorded in an Icelandic church, and later worked over in the studio.\nVirgins is the first Tim Hecker album more focused on performance than process. Most of it was recorded with a small group of orchestral musicians affiliated with Bedroom Community, the collective that also includes composers Nico Muhly, Ben Frost, Valgeir Sigurðsson and Paul Corley. (Frost helped record Ravedeath; Paul Corley engineered both Ravedeath and Virgins, and co-produced Oneohtrix Point Never’s R Plus Seven at Bedroom Community’s Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik; Oneohtrix Point Never’s Dan Lopatin collaborated with Hecker on 2011’s Instrumental Tourist: The world of forward-thinking electro-acoustic music is a small and fraternal one.)\nThe live-room conceit is an interesting turn for an artist who for a long time worked in a primarily digital realm: Rather than having the music conjure a space, the space now shapes the music—a return to idea of sound as something that exists in the air before on hard drives, and of albums as specific records of specific people in specific places. Even the electronics—and there are still plenty of electronics—sound like they’re refracting and ricocheting off of wood and metal, scraping a ceiling, trying to find a way out.\nHecker’s music has always been eerie, but never this forceful. Some sections of Virgins feel like soundtracks for horror-movie climaxes when the camera fixes on a sickening image and refuses to turn away, fascinated and trapped at the same time. Even the album’s quieter moments are more tense than they might’ve been on Hecker’s earlier albums—a function, maybe, of a live-room environment where every creak and whisper seems to be happening a few feet from the speakers instead of at some artificially cavernous distance.\nThis is music that benefits from being heard loud and/or on headphones in the same way couches are best experienced by actually sitting down in them instead of just brushing your fingers against the upholstery as you leave the room. Like a lot of Ben Frost’s albums (or something like Swans’ The Seer), Virgins feels possessed by the idea that no advancements in society or technology will ever shake our primal reactions to fear, wonder, awe and what in a more naïve era used to be called the sublime. And while it’s a fallacy to think that hyperseriousness is the only way to strike people at their core, it’s still inspiring to hear an artist—especially one who started out as mellow as Hecker—double down and make a statement so confrontational. Once haunted, now he’s the one who haunts. ",

        "article_text": "Trigger warning: If you or someone you love is a fuckboy, do yourself a favor and steer clear of Run the Jewels 2. You will not like what you hear. Here’s a brief, but nearly complete list of people who are exempt, as handed down by El-P and Killer Mike on RTJ2: Malcolm X, UGK (Pimp C posthumously given the Lifetime Achievement Award), MJG, the Weathermen (both the hip-hop and militant factions), Gangsta Boo, Scarface (thats Brad Jordan, Al Pacinos is noticeably absent here), Zack De La Rocha, Biggie, 2Pac, Nas (ca. 1993 and also 2014, as this is being released on his Mass Appeal imprint). That’s really about it.\nOtherwise, when El-P sneers, \"You want a whore in a white dress/ I want a wife with a thong\" during \"Angel Duster\", it’s a metaphor that implicates just about everybody in his blast radius—conservative and liberal politicians who hide their bullshit ideals behind \"values,\" religious figures doing the same, beta-male types using performative tolerance as a front for their passive-aggressive misogyny, or just anyone who’s full of shit. For Run the Jewels, these people are what cocaine was to Clipse, sex to Lil Wayne, clothing to Cam’ron—their domain, their muse, a seemingly endless source of inspiration for the most viciously realized rap album of 2014 and most other years.\nIt’s important to note that RTJ2 is an album—it’s on a real label and you can pay money to own it. And the transition from mixtape-to-album explains every progression El-P and Killer Mike have made in the past year. Think of it as the Hell Hath No Fury to Run the Jewels’ We Got It 4 Cheap—the latter were freewheeling collaborations that introduced commercially exiled veterans to a new audience of microphone fiends and completely reframed their public perception. The sequel feels more like a statement, taking into account crucial constructs like sequencing, judiciously granted guest spots, and pacing. But Run the Jewels exchange Clipse’s unrelenting, and highly specific mean streak for a righteous anger that has a gleeful, conspiratorial edge—Run the Jewels get it and you get them.\nThis is one of the more readily apparent aspects of Run the Jewels’ development as a functioning group; they were a festival act from the start and RTJ2 is a rare hip-hop record that sounds like it was created with live performance in mind. They’re two guys with dexterous, booming voices over blaring production that’s percussive, abrasive, and dynamic. The first half is uncut aggression for any situation in transit, the first thing you can reach for if you’re getting elbowed on the subway or cut off in traffic driving down I-85. As RTJ2 progresses, it’s still the same detritus that filled El-P’s iron galaxy in the past, only now, the forms are recognizable and warm: dub’s echo and synth bass swiped from Amnesiac commingle on \"All My Life\", vocal snippets are taken from Police Academy’s Michael Winslow on \"Oh My Darling Don’t Cry\", and Zack De La Rocha on \"Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)\" before the real thing comes through to spit some goofy, try-hard \"Bombtrack\"-style aggro braggadocio that doubles as the best verse of his life. On the whole, RTJ2 is El-P’s most accessible and rangy production to date and he’s hit a stride that recalls Sonic Youth in 1987 or Animal Collective in 2004, the point where a celebrated noise terrorist starts to embrace and challenge their audience rather than simply testing their patience.\nRun the Jewels are undeniably a crossover hip-hop act, and cognizant of their unique position—Mike and Els career-changing 2012 albums respectively came courtesy of Cartoon Network and a former blues label that spent years claiming the Black Keys as their most \"contemporary\" act. Both have been around long enough to recognize they share stages with EDM acts and fans with Future and Young Thug; rather than seeing them as threats, they view them as inspiration and competition, as it’s the commercial vanguard who are fucking with language and syntax as much as Def Jux and Dungeon Family ever were.\nAnd therein is the most important lack of distinction on RTJ2, that between \"old school\" and \"new school,\" \"lyrical\" and whatever its opposite is, as if hip-hop isn’t a living, evolving organism. El and Mike deliver both blows to the sternum and elbow-jabs to the ribs; there are hours worth of instantly quotable, clever ignorance, as in El-P’s already much-loved request that haters, \"Can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks.\" Meanwhile, Mike’s verse on \"All Due Respect\" is a blacked-out, brilliant clinic in rhythm, wordplay and content—\"This year, we iller than a nun in a cumshot/ Getting double-penetrated in a dope spot/ By two hard pipe hittin’ niggas/ On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2Pac/ I beat you to a pulp, no fiction/ Tarantino flow, new Jules (Jewels) and Vincent.\"\nThroughout RTJ2, the duo appear limitless in their vocal capacity, whether working as a tag team, storytellers, or engaging in battle-rap one-upmanship. \"Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1\" is all razzle dazzle alliteration, while \"Oh My Darling Don’t Cry\" compiles a career’s worth of flows, from \"We Dem Boyz\"-derived \"hol’ up\"s! to Adidas-scuffing tough talk to the triplet-flipping \"Move that Dope\" cadence. Any sort of geographical or philosophical or stylistic boundary that stood between the two no longer exists, if it ever did; El is just as likely to spit Dirty South double time raps about strippers as Mike is to wax about obscure historical figures and governmental conspiracies.\nRTJ2is darker, bolder, and longer than its predecessor, though still clocking in at a bullshit-free 39 minutes; the difference between this and most sequels is that this one actually has a plot. Both El-P and Killer Mike are pushing 40, career artists spitting grown-ass raps about grown-ass problems. They came of age during a time when \"the black CNN\" was actually something worth aspiring to and hip-hop isn’t the one that failed to keep up its end of the bargain; I don’t know if they finally found the plane or have moved onto 24-hour coverage of the ebola panic, but these days you might as well be watching Channel Zero. Comedians are now delivering the hardest news anyway, and RTJ2 is more \"Last Week Tonight\", ditching the ironic distance that typified political humor and going straight for the killshot.\nAs with Vince Staples’ \"Hands Up\", \"Early\" is live reportage of police brutality that wasn’t directly inspired by the death of Michael Brown. Which is what makes it even more frightening. The racial dynamic of Run the Jewels is occasionally played for laughs on RTJ2; here, its acknowledged in a powerful, unspoken way, as Mike’s role is that of the street preacher, empowered by the support of his people, whereas El plays the wilderness prophet, his madness spurred by the realization his craziest thoughts are coming to pass. Mike is harassed in his home over trivial weed possession and taken away in cuffs while the neighbors record the scene on their cell phones. Meanwhile, El-P walks the streets of New York untouched by the police, but affected by his own powerlessness. He closes his mournful verse with \"They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording/ But didn’t record a cop when he shot no warning,\" concluding the cycle of violence with, \"Go home, go to sleep, up again early\"—the last line echoing \"it was everyday America and that’s all\" from Sun Kil Moon’s \"Pray for Newtown\", another anti-gun protest whose headlines were pulled from the past and has its relevance renewed throughout 2014 in regular and increasingly dispiriting intervals.\nA similar splitscreen occurs on \"Crown\"; Mike’s verse is based on a true story, recalling his days of slinging cocaine to a pregnant woman just to make ends meet, praying for God to give him a lane out of this life. Once the kid is born, Mike sighs, \"Heard he was normal til three and then he stopped talking,\" racked with guilt until he meets the woman a few years later and she relieves him of his burden—\"I’ve been redeemed/ I found in Christ/ Whatever it take, I hope you find it, Mike.\" Meanwhile, El takes a surprisingly empathetic tone towards an army ensign who himself was just trying to find his own lane, pitying the man for voluntarily surrendering his free will to become a human weapon but understanding the choice in light of the mental torture. Whereas the broad scope of R.A.P. Music and Cancer for Cure made Run the Jewels seem like a one-off lark, the interaction between El and Mike on \"Crown\" and \"Early\" makes those records somehow sound incomplete in retrospect.\nBut these moments of reflection are wisely paced within RTJ2’s otherwise relentless assault. \"Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)\" is the hardest, most celebratory track about starting a prison riot since \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\"; sulfur burns and wardens are waterboarded, as, \"We killin’ em for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom/ And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord’ll sort em.\" The most unconventional social study occurs on \"Love Again (Akinyele Back)\"; as Yeezus proved, consensual, unorthodox sex is instantly heard as misogyny and the he-said, she-said hook of, \"She want that dick in her mouth all day\" certainly courts trouble. At least until Gangsta Boo steals the track with a verse of even greater demands and vulgarity, in the same way she made filthy Three 6 Mafia songs like \"Tongue Ring\" and \"Hit It From the Back\" sound strangely progressive in their gender politics.\nReferring to \"Put It in Your Mouth\", the most infamous track of \"Love Again\"’s parenthetical namesake, El-P commented, \"i feel lucky to have grown up in a time when filthy/stupid/funny rap songs could be hits like that one.\" RTJ2 isn’t backwards-looking or a throwback, but any record whose most notable guest appearances come from former members of Three 6 Mafia and Rage Against the Machine is nostalgic to some degree. There’s also the hovering influence of not just N.W.A. and Public Enemy, but also less critically revered innovators like the Geto Boys, Goodie Mob, and 8Ball \u0026 MJG, Southern acts whose intelligence and complexity felt natural, wisdom from stoops, liquor stores, and street corners that translated to college dorms without ever presenting themselves as \"art\" or \"conscious\" rappers.\nAs much as El-P and Killer Mike want to distance themselves from being seen as role models, they are; their experience just happens to sound a hell of a lot like the truth. Towards the end of \"Lie, Cheat, Steal\", Killer Mike digs a shallow grave for deposed Clippers despot Donald Sterling, but not entirely for his horrifying racism; what truly offends Mike is seeing the guy blubbering on TV, giving apologies he doesn’t mean in the slightest, outing himself as another \"prisoner of privilege\" in a system where even a billionaire isn’t in control of his destiny. And the common thread that ties RTJ2 with some of the other widely-celebrated albums of 2014—Benji, To Be Kind, and Beyoncé—is that each is an example of a seasoned artist using their financial and artistic capital to take control of the means of production and distribution, putting the least amount of distance between themselves and their vision. \"Independent as fuck\" indeed; sounding like nothing else and answering to nobody but its creators, Run the Jewels 2 is in a class by itself.",

        "article_text": "Heres what we know about Iceage: They are four friends, ages 18 and 19, from Denmark. Their debut LP, New Brigade, has actually been out in their home country since January, with a much smaller, limited run coming to the United States earlier this year. These are the essentials. Over the past few months, as New Brigade has been passed back and forth online with increasing enthusiasm, there has been a remarkable amount of chatter, some of it focused on their age, some of it on their music, some of it on faraway mystique.\nNot long ago, a Danish daily deemed them \"teenage punks full of anger and anxiety,\" a line galvanized by bloody post-show photos of smiling audience members published on their blog. Questions like \"Are they the saviors of punk music?\" have been posed, as though punk music needs saving. They just played their first show in the U.S. this past weekend, in Brooklyn. It sold out. The New York Times and The New Yorker have weighed in. Theyre set to return to Roskilde this summer. As you may have already realized, theres a swirl of information and interest surrounding this band right now, at the heart of which is their music.\nAnd it turns out that New Brigade is a refreshing and extraordinary debut. These four have located a punk-rock sweet spot: mixing the black atmosphere of goth, the wild-limbed whoosh of hardcore, and the clangor of post-punk. Its a feat made all the more impressive by one very important intangible: energy. While they still have room to grow as songwriters, the energy in every atom of New Brigades charred, sub-25-minute rush is seductive. From the moment \"White Rune\" starts to quake until those last tangles of guitar conk out on closer \"Youre Blessed\", theres little escape from this records grip. Even the foreboding mash and march of \"Intro\", its wordless, 46-second pulse of a prelude, is enough to make you feel like you need to fling yourself in the direction of someone else.\nThat said, despite the typically direct, blunt-object nature of \"punk,\" much of New Brigade is also impressionistic. Elias Rønnenfelts words (sung in English rather than Danish) are largely unintelligible, leaving a lot up to the heart and imagination. Rønnenfelt finds an effective way of sharing just enough room for listeners to fill in the blanks. As if mimicking the motions of his own guitar, he scythes his way through each song, usually to anthemic heights. That you can hear in the gasp of \"Collapse\" and starry-eyed bounce of \"Remember\". Even more so in aforementioned climax \"Youre Blessed\", a song that sounds like a more irritable cousin to the poppy, post-hardcore emo that came of age here in the 1990s.\nThe albums grit has nothing to do with fidelity. While Iceage employ decidedly abrasive no-wave textures, New Brigade was recorded in a proper studio. The result is a recording whose snare hits and basslines announce themselves with real fury. And though a lot of this music might seem from a distance like a dozen ideas thrown together in the space of a single song, what theyve done here is deceptively precise and exists on a deeply personal, unfiltered plane. All these lurches and groans and crashes and bangs and stutters and roars come together to form one consistently rousing, emotionally immediate whole. From them to you.",

        "article_text": "The brilliant hardcore band Converge have been around a long time, though you might not guess it from the manic energy crammed into their eighth album, All We Love We Leave Behind. If you go beyond the amped, break-neck intensity and listen to the compositions, it becomes clear the Boston band is nearing the 25-year mark: You dont just show up and write songs like this.\nOne of the quartets not-so-secret weapons is Kurt Ballou, the guitarist (and backing vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, etc.), who happens to be one of the most well-regarded engineers in heavy music and an endless tinkerer whod build a snare from scratch if it meant getting the sound he needed. The central core of vocalist/in-house artist Jacob Bannon and Ballou-- along with bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller, who both joined in 1999-- have been together long enough to know each other very well, and to play almost entirely to their own strengths. As such, theres never a dull moment across AWLWLBs 38 minutes. Its all peaks.\nThe record is the logical followup to 2009s Axe to Fall, my favorite record that year. Axe included a large supporting cast of friends and fellow travelers from Cave In, Disfear, Genghis Tron, the Red Chord, and Neurosis. It ended with a seven-minute song that seemed to include them all. When I spoke with Converge frontman Jacob Bannon a few weeks ago about AWLWLB, he said Axe to Fall had been the \"collaborative concept taken to the extreme.\" This time, its just the band and the watchful ear of Ballou. As Bannon put it, \"Theres no artificial distortion, triggers, or Auto-Tune on this album. Its all organic, its real sounds that capture the way the band performs live.\"\nFrom opener (and first single) \"Aimless Arrow\" onward, the music here is mostly fast, compact, and coiled. Thats Converge in general, but theyve distilled the elements to even tauter extremes this time. The technical mastery is mind-blowing, as is the way they manage to squeeze in brutal melodies and hooks. The vocal lines seem to be woven into the guitars, to which theyve also added a bluesier feel, a detail that reminds me of the classic post-Negative Approach Touch and Go band Laughing Hyenas-- or even the Jesus Lizard. Its a streamlined, live-sounding collection that can feel like one giant kick to the head. But they know when to give, take, and plop in a slow-grind blues riff. Tracks overlap and echo. When they slow things down to a momentary crawl with the albums longest song, the five-minute doom ballad \"Coral Blue\", its like a chairs been pulled out from behind you. You get that in the middle of the two-minute \"Empty on the Inside\" as well as the instrumental \"Precipice\", an interstitial piece with piano, clean guitars, psychedelic soloing guitars, and deep-factory/chain-gang percussion. \"All We Love We Leave Behind\" picks all of that up gorgeously.As overwhelming as AWLWLB may be on first listen, its really not all speed. Theres a thing people say about young professional quarterbacks, about how they need experience before the game \"slows down.\" You get that on this album, too. In my interview with Bannon, he said: \"I feel that the current generation of listeners of heavy music are progressing a bit past their gateway bands and are digging deeper than they used to and understanding more abrasive and complex music and art. Its like being around an unfamiliar language long enough that it eventually begins to make sense.\" I agree with this, and its the reason why Converge are a band with plenty of fans who werent close to being born when the band formed in 1990.\nOf course, theres plenty for older audiences, too-- aging, death, decisions, punk as a way of life, and the way these things preoccupy you when you go past 30 are largely what this album is about. (It all opens with \"Aimless Arrow\"s \"To live the life you want/ Youve abandoned those in need\"). Bannon describes the grizzled two-minute anthem \"Shame in the Way\" as a song about \"feeling fragmented from the traditional concept of family.\" He adds, \"As Ive gotten older, Ive worked on mending the things I can, while being conscious of the things I cant repair.\" You get this on the genuinely moving title track, too. Bannon calls it \"an open letter to the things that I feel Ive left behind in order to pursue an artistic and musical direction in my life.\" He says it was inspired in part by the death of his beloved dog, Anna Belle, but theres a lot more than that here: Its a classic hardcore anthem, one that looks at the decision to live a life in a particular way, and it might bring you to tears if you hear it right. Really, more than the past couple of Converge albums, AWLWLB feels like a hardcore record.\nWe live in a period of compression, where theres more stimulation and less time for reflection-- but were also continually presented with a repackaged, slightly off past. Nostalgia is musics biggest seller, it seems. The thing is, underground bands that formed in 1990 are often getting back together in 2012 for reunion tours, not eighth albums. The irony of the title, of course, is that Converge are also a lesson in not leaving behind what matters. \"Predatory Glow\" ends the record with the lines: \"Let the future know/ I wont be there tomorrow/ Let the past know/ I gave them my all/ Im aching for an end/ Grown thinner every day/ I bow down to you/ Extinguished youth.\" When I asked about the song, Bannon explained: \"I am far from an old person in human terms, however Ive spent over half my life immersed in the punk rock and hardcore community. I am not wholly defined by that as a person, but it is something that has been part of me for a long time.\"\nAnd it will be, until he dies. AWLWLB is an example of building on and mastering the music you loved when you were younger-- something that became more than music, ultimately-- so that it has a chance to grow old with you without becoming any less vital.",

        "article_text": "Although the Calgary Flames lost by a single goal in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals-- squandering their chance to become the first Canadian team to take home the trophy since 1993-- the vanquished hockey players country-folk have no reason to hang their collective heads. Among their luminaries, the Canucks can count a bilingual prime minister who speaks in full sentences, filmmaker Guy Maddin, and Vancouvers preeminent redheaded songwriter, Carl Newman, who has just released, by a stride, the best power-pop album of 2004.\nNewman worked through his more angular pop leanings in the mid-1990s with Sub Pop indie rockers Zumpano and is now the primary songwriter in The New Pornographers. To place The Slow Wonders aesthetics in terms that The New Pornographers fans will understand, these 11 tracks blend Mass Romantics clipped frenetics, Electric Versions spacious tenderness, and the agile twists and turns of Zumpano, effortlessly humbling all three. On The Slow Wonder, the hooks crack apart and multiply, accruing additional catchiness the way the pumped muscles of a spinach-stuffed Popeye give birth to crops of testosterone-filled goose bumps. At one point in \"Drink to Me Babe Then\", a languid group of whistlers double themselves harmoniously before a quavering electromagnetic guitar blazes overhead; elsewhere, a fading melodian shoots rubber bands at the stars.\nTaken as a single document, The Slow Wonder fits together for a taut 34 minutes without lags or rough spots; viewed as collection of singles, all but a couple tracks would justifiably fill the A-side of a seven-inch. From the catchy drum-fill intro of \"Miracle Drug\" to \"35 in the Shade\"s soaring exit guitar, theres not a misfire to be found. Time and time again, Newman showcases a quaint nostalgia and a layered sense of production that often feels similar to the inventive beauty that made The Shins Chutes Too Narrow such a whopper of a sophomore release. Like the exquisite chamber pop that Richard Davies and Eric Matthews showcased as Cardinal, these songs have a comfortable Kinks-like feel while still sporting their own unique, keenly crafted hooks.\nThroughout the album, Newman keeps the palette varied, cramming enough pop muscularity into his two- and three-minute blasts to infuse this genre with the life it possessed in its 70s heyday. \"On the Table\" makes use of flourishing ragtime piano, a regal trumpet emerges from the fragile tambourine and deep percussion of \"The Cloud Prayer\", and \"The Town Halo\"s sinewy cello propels like a metallic fuzz bass with zero distortion.\nOn \"Miracle Drug\", rat-a-tat surf drums gain momentum when interlaced with brazen rock guitar licks and a quirky storyline: \"He was tied to the bed with a miracle drug in one hand/ In the other, a great lost novel that, I understand, was returned with a stamp/ That said thank you for your interest, young man.\" Instead of Neko Cases swooping country intonations and general high-end foil, Newman harmonizes here with Sarah Wheeler, who adds exultant punctuation to the tracks \"So why all the history now?\" refrain.\nNot mere ear candy, The Slow Wonders playful, often surrealistic libretto riffs on guilt and innocence, victorious defeat, secret agents, boring rich kids, small-town saviors and the onset of revelations. Newmans concerns rest more with relational discourse and struggles than bubblegum and flowers-- fitting for an artist whose press photos show him asleep with a copy of Foucaults Power/Knowledge. Amid the hard/soft tidal wave of \"The Battle for Straight Time\", Newman chirps in staccato, \"O come sweet life, wash clean my hands/ The revolution has been left to chance/ This dawns on me every morning at about three.\"\nSounding a lot like a track by The New Pornographers, \"On the Table\" looks at justice as \"the deal between the thieves and exits.\" When \"Come Crash\", a seemingly pure and dark love ballad enters the picture, its more a sleepy love story written by J.G. Ballard than the wimpy sentiments of feckless and freckled romantic: \"Thats luck, she led, we should be dead/ We eyed the wreck. Good god, we said/ She plants one kiss, for the road, on my chest/ Sirens came after we left.\" In the Guided by Voices-inflected \"35 in the Shade\"-- perhaps the albums most metaphorically charged track-- Newman plays with Cleopatra and magicians in order to win an argument, all the while trying not to miss his ride home from a bar.\nAlthough not much longer than an episode of Small Wonder, Newman has created a timeless document. These are soulful sing-alongs with grit, pop nuggets that hold up to hours of repeat play in humid bumper-to-bumper traffic, and ultimately, the sound of a great songwriter hitting his stride.\n ",

        "article_text": "Benjamin Power and Andrew Hung, the duo behind Fuck Buttons, are restless, inveterate equipment scavengers: Theyve worked on computer software, on Casio keyboards, on childrens toys, on old karaoke machines. In interviews, they come off as eager, curious, and transparent about their process and their gear, but their music is about as approachable as an Egyptian tomb. On Slow Focus, their first album in four years, Fuck Buttons remain devoted to forbidding, elemental sensations, and their slow-moving pieces inspire the kinds of big feelings-- exhilaration, majesty, awe-- that double as reminders of our smallness. \nListening to their progression, from 2008s Street Horrrsing to now, you get the sense of tinkerers building obsessively retooled versions of the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, each bigger than the last. (We are the apes in this equation.) They got their start in the noise-rock community, but transcended that niche almost immediately, and their earliest material, some of featuring distorted, screaming vocals, sounds positively quaint in light of what followed. Tarot Sport was so much larger and more ambitious than their debut that it gave them an unlikely career as festival headliners, and a piece of the album (\"Surf Solar\") snuck its way into Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. Slow Focus feels like a logical endpoint to their journey: Tarot Sport might have gotten them to the Olympics, but theyve never sounded this, well, Olympian before.\nThe difference is apparent from the opening seconds of the nine-minute \"Brainfreeze.\" The massive sounds we hear-- a warped synth figure being pounded into shapes by hammering drums and a pistoning rhythm track-- are lonelier and more remote than anything Fuck Buttons have made before. Tarot Sport, big as it was, gestured vaguely at human bodies, with airy, glittering sounds on \"Surf Solar\" evoking an outdoor festival or a rave. There are no human bodies left on Slow Focus, just open space and hard surfaces, and the sounds resound for miles in all directions.\nPower and Hung self-produced the record, and judging from the results, they should start producing for other acts as well. Every sound on Slow Focus is smooth, polished, and lovingly molded, like a factory-shaped piece of steel. The albums tone is a curious mix of juiced and muted, like Hung and Power have rewired the maximalism of stadium EDM to arrive at the minimalist emptiness of someone like Detroits Robert Hood. This is perfectionists music: Dr. Dre, who has been holed up for years vacuuming pathogens off of Detox like dead skin cells from a computer keyboard, might be chasing a sound like this-- deep and resonant and beautifully emptied-out.\nThe seven tracks tend to move in simple, navigational arcs: Open widescreen on an empty vista, pull back even further. Midway through \"Brainfreeze\", the synths shift up an octave and widen outward until they slowly swallow the track, a giant space cruiser blotting out the sky. \"The Red Wing\" begins with percussive pops and adds layers until the percussion all but disappears, a city shrinking to pinprick in a shuttle window. This journey might grow wearying if the textures on the album werent so fascinating and dimensional; a piece like \"Stalker\" seems to be operating on six different planes at once, and its a pleasure just to be able to walk through the space.\nThe song titles -- \"Sentients\", \"The Red Wing\", \"Hidden XS\"-- are unusually instructive for Fuck Buttons, who normally make a point of avoiding specific cues for their music. But Slow Focus plays like a utopian nightmare of mechanization-- on \"Year of the Dog,\" György Ligeti strings screech beneath a Giorgio Moroder synth, while the first sound on the ten-minute \"Stalker\" is a bland, lasering synth, like a printer whirring away at a thousand-page document. Slow Focus is pointedly pitiless, inexorable: There are no human feelings here, at least of the squishy kind. If you are fascinated by the people around you the same way you are fascinated by protozoa, you might identify uncomfortably with the world Slow Focus depicts. When at the next TED Conference, a clicker-brandishing, headset-wearing speaker argues that harvesting organs from the rest of the human population is the logical way to progress, \"Stalker\" will probably be playing on the slideshow. \nThere has always been menace in Fuck Buttons music, but it used to exist in balance with lighter, leavening moments, like \"Bright Tomorrow\" or \"The Lisbon Maru\". With the exception of the manic, squeegeeing synths that dance through \"Princes Prize\", that touch is absent on Slow Focus. Its missed, slightly, but a little humor would have punctured the purity of the world theyve built. Power and Hung have made either the years most introverted party album or the most expansive loners album; either way, there are few albums this year that offer this much space to get lost in.",

        "article_text": "The 1974 photo of Andy Warhol superstar Candy Darling on the cover of Antony and the Johnsons second full length, I Am a Bird Now, is the perfect complement to the ghostly hymnals that flit and sigh behind its black and white shadows. A melancholy but arrestingly beautiful image, it depicts Darling on her deathbed; bright flowers float behind her upturned arm like a cluster of soft, pale moons radiating light onto the bleached sea of sheets in which shes drowning.\nBesides being a tight aesthetic move, the image also links Antony to the early fabulousness of downtown New York, reminding the informed viewer not only of Darlings too-early death from leukemia, but the AIDS-related passing of the photographer himself, Peter Hujar in 1987 (the same year Warhol died, following routine gall bladder surgery). Klaus Nomi was already buried by then, and the Downtown scene was getting too close to saying goodbye to Cookie Mueller, Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, and Antonys sometime doppelganger Leigh Bowery (the subject of Boy Georges musical Taboo), among others-- all victims of the AIDS virus.\nThis visual meditation on death and radical history smoothly conjures the family tree upon which pale, angelic Antony perches. The vocalist/pianist moved from California to NYC after seeing the documentary Mondo New York, lured by the 1980s cabaret scene it depicted. Quite fittingly, his first performance came with a musical troupe called Blacklips at the famed Downtown venue, the Pyramid. Jump now to 2003, when Antony opened for Lou Reed and sang the Velvet Underground classic \"Candy Says\" (yes, for Candy Darling) as an encore after most performances. Knowing all of this-- the very important history in that cover-- helps to understand the melancholy, sense of loss, and rapturous joy in these 10 tracks.\nBut however aesthetically intriguing and complex that history may be, the ultimate draw is Antonys voice, and within the first two seconds of the album, it should be very clear to even the most unaware newbies that Antony has an amazing Nina Simone/Brian Ferry/Jimmy Scott vibrato, a multi-octave siren that would sound painfully lovely no matter what he was saying. Lucky for us, he fills that promise with worthy syllables. The greatness of this downcast crooner is the melding of that otherworldly trill with a dark, powerful aesthetic. Looking past his sad eye make-up and kewpie-doll features are these mesmerizing songs about loving dead boys, plaintive letters from hermaphroditic children, the fear of dark lonesome purgatories, breast amputation, the fluidity of gender. The first words of \"Hope Theres Someone\" and of the album \"Hope theres someone wholl take care of me/ When I die\" feel more lonesome than just about anything and then theres the rapturous promise of \"For Today I Am A Boy\" that \"One day Ill grow up and be a beautiful woman/ One day Ill grow up and be a beautiful girl\".\nI Am a Bird Nows majesty didnt come easily: Antonys self-titled debut was released five years ago on David Tibets Durtro label, but only now has he found the perfect mix between style and substance. More stripped down than earlier offerings-- most of the focus is on piano and voice, although violin, viola, cello, sax, and flute are also heard-- theres no missing Antonys thoughtful words.\nThere are a number of guest vocal spots-- Devendra Banhart (gypsy incantations in the beginning of \"Spiralling\"), Boy George (\"You Are My Sister\"), Rufus Wainwright (\"What Can I Do?\"). All of these powerful singers are overshadowed by Antonys angelic chops, though Boy George ends up turning in a surprisingly moving performance. His duet with Antony explores private memory, brotherhood/sisterhood (regardless of gender), relationships, empowerment (\"I was so afraid of the night/ You seem to move to places/ That I feared\"), and wish fulfillment. (Really, grab the hankies.)\nFor his part, longtime Antony fan/champion Lou Reed does a little spoken \"I was lying in my bed last night\" intro and some chunky guitar chords on the doo-wop horn swagger of standout \"Fistful of Love\", which works itself up to a frothy Otis Redding devotional to loves bruises and the comfort of a familiar fist: \"I accept and I collect the memories of your devotion on my body\".\nThe mingling of friends is a treat but, heart in his hand, Antony can more than ably go it alone-- even though he spends so much of I Am A Bird Now fearing solitude and celebrating those rare perfect connections. Then again, in this carefully laid out record, the final track, \"Bird Gurl\", leads quite dramatically to full-fledged climax as our hero searches for and finds wings, finally taking a solo flight. Contrast this with the pathos of the openers fear of falling asleep and that \"middle place\" between light/life and darkness/death. Of course, when the album begins again, so does the reality of perhaps having nobody to hold an aching dying head. But then, so does Antonys riveting trip towards his airborne epiphany. And on the cover, Candys flowers remain in bloom.\n ",

        "article_text": "Around the turn of the millennium, Godspeed You! Black Emperor were the right band at the right time. They arrived with their debut album, F#A#∞, in 1997, when the speed of technology was accelerating, genres were being shuffled, and people were thinking about where music might go. Godspeed, a loose and mysterious collective from Canada (guitarist Efrim Menuck seemed like the leader, but they preferred to be received as a unit) with an anarchist political bent who fused Ennio Morricone, minimalism, found sound, and metal-inflected noise, presented one intriguing possibility.\nThe group stayed busy during its initial run-- by 2002, when they released Yanqui U.X.O., they had put out three expansive full-lengths and a long EP-- and then they put Godspeed on the shelf and went away for a while. If theyd never gotten back together and had never released another note of music, it wouldnt have mattered. Their legacy was secure. But Godspeed started playing live again in 2010 and, just as it was when they first came on the scene, they filled a hole in music that we either didnt know existed or had forgotten about. Then, two weeks ago, came the surprise announcement of a new album, Allelujah! Dont Bend! Ascend!, their first in exactly 10 years. Once again, their timing is impeccable. If Godspeed around the turn of the millennium felt like a band of the moment, now, in a time of rapid cultural turnover and bite-sized music consumption, they feel out of step in a very necessary way.\nIts tempting to look at Allelujah! through the lens of politics, especially since Godspeed themselves have so often encouraged this viewpoint. When we last heard from them on record, it was a year after 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan was well underway, and the war in Iraq was just around the corner. We were settling into a decade that was, from an American perspective, defined by two wars started by an increasingly unpopular president and an inflating economic bubble that would pop just as he was leaving office. Their music and presentation drew some of its energy from this anxiety. So listening to new music from Godspeed now-- during an election season, when the wars and the aftermath of that economy are still being argued every day by two presidential candidates grappling with the legacy of the early 2000s-- you cant help but allow the political moment to shape how its heard.\nBut the focus on the bands politics obscures something important: Godspeed You! Black Emperor are making art, not writing editorials. And the fact that they are making art gives them leeway to do things that wouldnt work in the context of pure rhetoric. It allows them to find magnificence in destruction and build an aesthetic out of decay and loss. So for all their political slogans, pointed titles, and references to global doom, engagement with Godspeeds music can feel exceedingly personal. When listening to their music, Im not necessarily thinking about the downtrodden transcending their place in the capitalist hierarchy or the end of the world; Im thinking about the idea of transcendence, the raw grace of noise, and the tragedy of endings. Godspeeds music works so brilliantly because it can be abstracted and scaled, blown up into an edifice that towers over a continent or shrunk down to something that feels at home in a bedroom. So mapping the contours of their grand music onto your own ordinary life can feel both natural and inspiring.\nThe two lengthy tracks on Allelujah!, \"Mladic\" and \"We Drift Like Worried Fire\", have been part of the bands live repertoire since 2003. So the record feels in one sense like Godspeed taking care of unfinished business, presenting existing music from their influential run in a context that showcases its full force and power. Taken together, those tracks serve as a 40-minute summary of everything that made this band great. \"Mladic\" is all gloom and menace, building from an opening vocal snippet, adding pings of guitar, strings that saw away in a Middle Eastern mode, and dark clouds of feedback. This is the Godspeed that learned so much from the pummeling repetition of Swans and the fiendish drama of metal. Theres not exactly hope in a track like \"Mladic\", but there is a kind of darkly shaded catharsis. Godspeed have never sounded quite this heavy, and its especially impressive in how far it can veer from the themes that hold it together without losing the thread.\n\"We Drift Like Worried Fire\" is the flip-side of \"Mladic\", both literally and figuratively. For all their grim black-and-white roadside imagery and scenes of destruction, it can be easy to overlook just how joyful Godspeeds music can be. Built around a simple guitar motif consisting of just a few notes, \"Worried Fire\" is one of those accruing pieces that gathers one element after another for 10 minutes until its so gorgeous you almost cant take it. And at exactly that moment, Godspeed pause and then push the music over the top with an explosion of guitar that snaps everything that came before into focus. \"Worried Fire\" is music that makes you forget about politics and the machinations of the record business and the bullshit of internet chatter and brings you into singularity with the sheer beauty of their sound, music to make you cry with a smile on your face. When its playing, the rest of the world goes away for 20 minutes.\n\"Worried Fire\" is also the kind of song that Godspeeds early peers (Mogwai, Dirty Three) as well as the bands that followed (Explosions in the Sky, Mono) write with some regularity, but they never quite hit these heights. Godspeed have always been about more than volume, more than just addition and subtraction. And if Yanqui found them getting a little too close to their descendants, Allelujah! makes clear that Godspeed will always own this sound. Few can match their feel for arrangement or sense of structure. And the two shorter tracks on this album, \"Their Helicopters Sing\" and \"Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable\", are evidence of their infallible ear for texture. Theyre both rich, dense drones, \"Helicopter\" an especially thick mix of feedback and accordion while \"Strung Like Lights\" is airier and more unstable, not unlike the locked groove that came at the second side of their debut F#A#∞.\nIn one of the many inserts that came with the vinyl version of that debut, theres a diagram that takes the form of an architectural blueprint. Its called \"Faulty Schematics of Ruined Machine [to Scale]\" and it contains a drawing with four axes marked as Fear, Hope, Desire, and Regret and text describing elements of the diagram in cryptic and desperate language. One paragraph highlights a drawing of a tape loop connected between a distant satellite and a broken tape machine, a loop \"so long it was rocketed thru atmosphere by wigged-out Soviet Cosmonaut... it will take three lifetimes to hear in its entirety.\" Godspeed use tape loops, both live and on record, and the key visual element of their shows involves the projection of 16mm film loops by collective member Karl Lemieux. For this band, theres always been something appealing about repeating cycles and rituals-- sounds and images that vanish over the horizon and then come back around again, like the trains that roll by their practice space at Hotel 2 Tango. Planets orbit, people are born and die, and music has a moment and then vanishes before returning again. And so it goes with Allelujah!, an album of music that is both new and old from a band that we thought we might never hear from again, one we should appreciate while we can.",

        "article_text": "Its Halloween, 2005, and John Darnielle-- preparing to lead another show as the Mountain Goats-- pulls on his costume: a priests robe. If its a joke, its a kind-hearted one: Most people at Mountain Goats shows know the words and arent afraid to sing them. Some weep while doing it. Darnielle has power over his audience, but he doesnt wield it-- instead, he posits himself as one of them: Someone moved by small stories of liquor-store clerks struggling with big concerns like salvation; a cautious optimist with empathy for the last gasp and the broken promise; someone who holds a melting candle for four-chord American folk music; a \"lyrics guy.\"\nHe sings a song about best friends whose dreams of death-metal stardom are crushed when one is shipped off to school. The story ends with Darnielle crowing, \"hail Satan!\" Everyone under the roof crows with him. Darnielles voice swells and his face fills with light. The irony is obvious, but I dont think thats why hes happy. (And I doubt he even registers it-- during performances, he squints, bucks, shouts \"yeah!\" before just about every instrumental break, and is in general totally unselfconscious.) My guess is hes happy because hes singing about two people who have found god for themselves, even if they couldnt decide whether to call their band Satans Fingers or the Killers or the Hospital Bombers.\nThis is how he works: Imposing grand themes on squalor, lending dignity to those who have none, passing gentle hands over people who probably deserve the lash. Hes written an album about the salvation of meth-heads and another about the bond between codependent alcoholics. Under a canopy of violins on last years \"Marduk T-Shirt Mens Room Incident\", he detailed what was either a rape or a murder with a voice a prosecutor might point out as sounding almost sympathetic. On 2005s \"Love Love Love\", the sick feeling in Raskolnikovs stomach-- after murdering Alyona Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment-- is posited as a reflex of love. Hallmark may disagree.\nThis keeps him honest and makes it almost impossible for him to be sentimental. In an interview early last year, I asked him if he loved his characters. \"I have loads of affection for them all, for sure,\" he said. \"But my relationship to most of them is the relationship you have with a close friend who you know is also a chronic liar.\"\nThese themes-- forgiveness, redemption, religion generally, and the Bible specifically-- have backlit his writing since the early 1990s, from boombox-recorded albums for tape-only labels like Shrimper to full-band albums like Tallahassee, which Darnielle started releasing in 2002 for 4AD. (Ive told curious friends that his music was \"alt-Christian,\" which ends the conversation pretty quickly.) But hes never been as explicit about the Bible as on The Life of the World to Come, 12 songs about \"hard lessons\" he learned from specific verses.\nThankfully hes not a pedant about it, and his songs arent songs of praise. Hes a lapsed Catholic and professed nonbeliever who told Pitchfork he still chants the Hare Krishna. He is, in his own words, \"into\" the Bible. He makes use of the book for what it is: A series of stories used to comfort and instruct us. Joan Didion once wrote that \"we tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" Darnielle is a professed fan.\nLifes tone is quiet and contemplative. The raw-nerve hollering of his early music is gone (except on \"Psalms 40:2\", where theres a blast of raw-nerve hollering so forceful that hes basically excused from straining himself in perpetuity). But over the past few albums hes filed his whisper into a tool as unique as his shout. The cataclysmic shutter-rattling of fan favorites like \"Going to Georgia\" is replaced with songs like \"Genesis 30:3\" and \"Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace\"-- in the latter (based on a verse where god promises total fucking disaster), Darnielles narrator ties up a hostage, drives through torrential rain, shoots up in the car as the world ends, and still never breaks out of his library voice. In these cases, the musics intensity comes from Darnielles restraint instead of being undermined it.\nHe still drives at uncomfortable dissonance: A vandal realizes vandalism is his way of standing closer to god; someone all but sings \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from a hospital bed. In general, though, Darnielles presence is ruminative and gentle. The arrangements are simpler, too-- mostly acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, occasionally accompanied by a small string section. Sometimes, just his voice and a piano, an instrument Darnielle was trained on as a child but didnt play with the Mountain Goats until 2005. (His self-taught guitar playing was a big part of the musics primitive appeal.) Life has no marimba jollies or effects-box glitter. No reggae-esque songs like \"New Zion\" or anthemic alt-rock like \"Autoclave\". This isnt a good, bad, or even surprising thing-- its simplicity actually echoes early Mountain Goats albums more clearly than anything hes released in the past few years.\nWhile he might elicit the specific from his listeners, his music-- especially here-- is general. This is his gift and the gift of effective storytellers: to build toward the general by using the specific. Jacob works for seven years to marry Rachel. Rachel is barren. Rachel asks him to sleep with her servant, Bilhah, so they can raise children. And now theres a Mountain Goats song called \"Genesis 30:3\" about the cheeks we turn and the tasks we take on for the people we love most. In a way, its like hes giving back to his fans or anyone who wants to listen: He spends an album relating to some of his favorite stories and tacitly invites us to do the same-- to consider what weve lived through and what weve learned.\nAt a recent Q\u0026A with the filmmaker Rian Johnson, whod shot him playing Life in a Pomona College auditorium, Darnielle talked about how wed hunted certain species to extinction, losing a relative to cancer, and valleys of paralyzing depression. He knew when to make a joke, and he made them often-- he has a really vigilant sense of humor, actually, which people who find him whiny probably dont expect. But his intensity radiates even when hes joking: One story he told involved a sound guy whod asked him if hed seen a particular film, and his response was, \"Does it have a guy in a hockey mask hacking up teenagers?\" The guy said no. \"Then I probably havent seen it.\"\n\"Im not great with personal boundaries,\" he said later, \"so Im sorry if Im making anyone here uncomfortable.\" Well, a little. But the discomfort isnt without redemption; its part and parcel. Its probably what most of us came for.",

        "article_text": "Natasha Khan has said her third album as Bat for Lashes is partly inspired by studying her own family history. This is informative. Her father, a trainer for the Pakistani national squash team, left suddenly when she was 11, and his departure casts a shadow on the fairytale drama of Bat for Lashes debut, 2006s Fur and Gold. Yeah, but one of the guys Khans dad coached? Her cousin, Jahangir Khan? He went on to become a six-time world champion and basically his sports equivalent of a Pelé or Michael Jordan. You dont need Natashas Ancestry.com password to know theres competitive drive in her blood.\nThats her up there in The Haunted Man cover art. Naked, un-retouched, and un-made-up, with a similarly naked man draped around her shoulders. The suggestion is that her follow-up to 2009s lavishly sensual Two Suns is more intimate and stripped bare, and sure enough, theres less reverb on Khans voice, and the lyrical concerns have moved from an otherworldly New York to the English countryside. But what the Ryan McGinley-shot art most closely shares with the music youll find within is that its at once striking and enigmatic-- and artfully constructed.\nSome albums sound effortless. The Haunted Man sounds like effort magnificently realized. The rawness of feeling is achieved through equally raw ambition. Bat for Lashes sophisticated blend of art-rock grandeur and synth-pop directness again carries echoes of 1980s luminaries like Kate Bush and the Cure, gleaming with autoharp, Abbey Road-recorded strings, and a continuing exploration of electronics. Spacious, boldly orchestrated, and emotionally rich, Khans latest is another step forward for the multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter, and one of the years most beguiling albums.\nTwo Suns sublime, Karate Kid-nodding \"Daniel\" won Britains Ivor Novello songwriting award. The potential hits here are just as overpowering. \"Lets Get Lost\", the sumptuous slab of goth-bubblegum Khan did with Beck for 2011s Twilight: Eclipse OST, was a promising sign of what to expect. On slinky, guitar-centric \"All Your Gold\", Khan is the one whos haunted, but it only takes a few listens before Gotyes awfully similar smash sounds fleshless in comparison. \"Marilyn\" adapts the 1950s matinee-idolatry of Lana Del Rey to a dream-pop production worthy of its \"silver screen,\" with a staggering, spectral bridge-- and several instrumental contributions from Beck (plus arranging by ex-Ash member Charlotte Hatherley).\nThough sometimes over-reaching, the less likely singles here are as darkly enigmatic, sonically curious, and thematically textured as their equivalents on Two Suns. The centerpiece is the title track, with its \"Scarborough Fair\"-tinged male choir marching up that distant hill. \"Yes, your ghosts have got me, too/ But its me and you,\" Khan replies, summing up the albums main conceit: the way previous experiences can twist our current relationships. On M83-gauzy, Dave Sitek-assisted opener \"Lilies\", though, \"the figure of a man\" answers a life-affirming, womanly prayer. Druid-like male voices on \"Oh Yeah\" introduce the poised yet passionate exultation of a narrator \"in bloom.\" As on the album cover, Khans music can acknowledge the female body without reducing it to sex-kitten cliché.\nIn fact, if the last album was about contrasts-- between two suns, two lovers, even two sides of the narrators persona-- then The Haunted Man is defined by balance, between the bare and the polished, between the communal and the personal, and between the respective ghosts haunting our personal interactions. Compromises can lead to breakthroughs: \"Where you see a wall, I see a door,\" Khan sings on \"A Wall\", another Sitek-backed, baroque synth-pop anthem. By the restrained yet intricate closing lullaby \"Deep Sea Diver\", which meets the bar set by Two Suns collaborative finale with famously reclusive crooner Scott Walker, Khan finds a compromise for two people separated by masks: \"Darling if you cant see out/ You know that I can hear you shout.\" Theyre together, alone, shaking through.\nThe most overtly naked track here, \"Laura\", is also the most transcendent. With a gently orchestra-kissed piano-and-voice arrangement, this goosebump-inducing collaboration with the former Lizzy Grants \"Video Games\" co-writer Justin Parker is the clearest example of how Bat for Lashes perches on the fulcrum between indie-associated sincerity and pop-oriented savvy. Well never know Laura, really, but we can feel what it might be like to know her. On an album with more names in the credits than Khan could ever use for song titles (also including Portisheads Adrian Utley, among many others), the greatest testament to her strength of will might be just this: She has added a new unforgettable character to pops family tree.",

        "article_text": "From the Vines to Wolfmother to Jet, recent Aussie rock exports have been painfully indebted to arena rock-- quick to recycle a sound but rarely succeeding in revitalizing it. Perth three-piece Tame Impala play with some of the ingredients of arena rock as well but do so in aid of more leftfield, organic sounds and interesting excursions. The result is a cleanly executed and frequently dazzling debut: Innerspeaker is a psychedelia-heavy outing that toys with paisley pop, stoner vibes, and an expansive array of swirling guitars.\nOn first listen, Innerspeaker provides a lot of dots to connect: There are patches of late-60s American psychedelia, buzzy Motor City riffage, and decades of British pop, ranging from the pastoral pop of the Kinks to the vivid expansiveness of the Verve to the narcotic warmth of the Stone Roses. Frontman Kevin Parker shares an eerie vocal similarity with John Lennon, both in tone and in the way he allows his voice to soar with each melodic turn or rhythmic surge. Though most of the album is a little restrained lyrically, Parkers rapturous phrasing conveys the meaning. Mixed by Flaming Lips collaborator Dave Fridmann, each component here is set on an even plane, allowing bass lines and delay-swept guitar bursts to melt into one another, cultivating a uniform feel thats vintage, far-out, and irrepressibly cool.\nBy all accounts, fixing their gaze so intently on established influences should play as either disingenuous or forced. Its difficult to be so plugged-in to a vintage feel without the music seeming time-capsuled, but the bands vibrance help these songs sound very much alive. Tame Impala arent taking a purely revisionist approach-- you arent left with a feeling that their intention was recreate some lost Love demo or an Jimi Hendrix Experience deep cut. If anything, their record points to some of the same roads traveled recently by bands like Animal Collective or Liars, but dials back the eccentricities and difficulty level, leaning on the guitar rather than electronics, and focusing their efforts through more traditional pysch-rock prisms. They arent as adventurous as their more offbeat peers, but because of their lazer-guided hooks and tangible pleasures, they might wind up reaching more people.\nThis is very much an albums album-- it sounds best as a piece, where you can get lost in its heady expanse. With the kaleidoscopic stereo-panning on \"Why Wont You Make Up Your Mind?\" or the maddening stomp on \"Bold Arrow of Time\", Innerspeaker demonstrates a subtle yet encompassing sense of control, never obstructing the grander motifs while still offering a variety of odd details that guide you back to the albums hooks. There arent any standout singles on Innerspeaker in the sense that its unlikely that people are going to be asking you to throw on certain tracks by name (though if in a pinch, \"Expectation\" and \"Why Wont You Make Up Your Mind?\" should suffice nicely). But when an album is able to tinker with and update familiar textures and moods without blurring the lines too much or just plain overdoing it, you can believe that psych fans will be asking for it to be thrown on regardless. If youre smart, youll oblige them.",

        "article_text": "Ditching Berliniamsburg for the real deal, Liars moved to Germany in late 2004 to replant their roots in fresh cultural soil and begin recording their third album in a studio that offered creative possibilities too fertile to resist: The acoustically rich radio facility in the former East Germany boasts a labyrinthine system of rooms, each with its own distinct acoustic advantages. The trios relocation is sure to be cited as the impetus for the Krautrock-like propulsivity of the resulting LP, but prior to the change of scenery they were exploring this kind of dark percussiveness on 2004s They Were Wrong, So We Drowned. Most listeners had shrugged that album off for its dissimilarity to the bands acclaimed dance-punk debut, They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, but while hectic, less refined, and at times sloppy, the underrated They Were Wrong marked the shift in direction that would lead Liars to the ethereal gorgeousness of Drums Not Dead.\nHighlighted by taut improvisation and frontman Angus Andrews mastery of falsetto, the records resolute seamlessness may be attributable to growth through practice: Liars wrote and recorded one album, but, not wholly satisfied with the results, decided against releasing it. Instead, that material was used as a blueprint for what became Drums Not Dead, and in the process, the band cast off They Were Wrongs witches and Walpurgisnacht. Granted, there is still a conceptual libretto, this time centered on the universal struggle between confidence and cowardice. These traits are represented by two characters: the instinctive and assertive Drum, and the pessimistic, apprehensive Mt. Heart Attack. Of course, as with They Were Wrong, any conceptual devices remain secondary to the sound and mood.\n\"Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!\" perfectly sets the stage, as fractured guitar waves, opiate military percussion, and Andrews windswept vocals careen into pitch-shifts which slightly deepen the shadows. Segueing into \"Lets Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack\", Liars let forth a siren call that bears an uncanny resemblance to the first few seconds of Fausts \"The Sad Skinhead\", then plunge into bubbling floor-tom/cymbal madness that echoes both Liquid Liquid and This Heat. The percussion is corporeal, tapping into some inner biological timepiece, and as on the albums best tracks, guitar notes are employed only as simple pulsing behind layered, seraphic vocals. Completing the mood-setting opening triad, \"A Visit From Drum\" is linked again by a vocal gasp; a less treated kit accompanies a floor tom/snare and the clattering of sticks for a creepy, mystic sounding incantation. Here and elsewhere, the guitar is an ambient sidekick to high-pitched vocals and tribal drumming.\nThose first three songs are the albums strongest grouping, yet the excellent push/pull sequencing of Drums Not Dead creates a shivery cumulative effect that spans the entire length of the record: By its closing notes, youre likely to find yourself awed and emotionally spent. \"Drum Gets a Glimpse\" pairs a mournful Eno-esque melodic sense with cymbal washes, M83 guitar tones, crickets, and Andrew trading lines between the naive and melancholy falsetto of Mt. Heart Attack (\"It seems like all our friends have gone\"), and the deeper, more authoritative Drum (\"You drove them out\").\nLater, there are a couple of abstract pieces-- fuzzier, looping canyon bliss-outs with left-channel acoustic guitar; a bit of swirling, Sister-era Sonic Youth shredding-- along with a pair of standouts. The first of these, \"Drum and the Uncomfortable Can\", is coated in reverb that amplifies the intensity of the cannibalistic double drumming: Its primal marching band music wrapped in guitar feedback and a howling voice singing about hiding a body. The second comes with the straightforward, closing ballad \"The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack\", which resolves the album at its-- and the bands-- absolute peak. Like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs \"Maps\", its surprise sentimentality lends essential emotional weight, but does so with a dedicated restraint. Gentle guitar drifts accrue density alongside sighing vocals, warmed tom tom heartbeats, tiny instrumental accents (piano, tambourine, roughed-up strings), and Andrews simple, sweet sentiments: \"I wont run far, I can always be found\"; \"If you want me to stay, I will stay by your side.\"\nFor added value, Liars flesh things out with an accompanying DVD that presents three visual versions of the album: \"Drums Not Bread\" by drummer Julian Gross, \"The Helix Aspersa\" by Andrew, and filmmaker Markus Wambsganss \"By Your Side\". Due to its liberal use of live and studio footage (and farm animals, actually), Gross best held my attention. More refined, Wambsganss creates effects with light and motion-- his three-channel video for \"The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack\" is his portions most compelling moment. Maintaining a stoic minimalism, Andrew fixates on a snails ponderous adventures through Germany.\nOf course, the music remains the greatest draw. Those who previously yearned for a career trajectory the band wisely ditched ought to listen to Drum and keep track of the epiphanies. In the coming weeks, its strengths will win converts, even among those whod previously jumped ship. But my favorite detail of this feel-good story-- popular Brooklyn post-punk band falls out of favor by changing directions and ultimately produces an album that eclipses its debut-- is that Liars are still waltzing along on their own terms. This, their third LP, shows zero concessions to the criticisms they received from publications like Spin and Rolling Stone, who awarded They Were Wrong their lowest possible marks. Succeeding rather than regressing or retreating, Liars have had the last laugh: Drums Not Dead is a majestic victory lap, and on all levels, a total fucking triumph.\n ",

        "article_text": "The Constantines 2001 debut is still a mostly unknown, untouched gem, glistening ruby red in the dim, dark recesses of your future psyche. Flawless albums come every year or two, but The Constantines was that rarest of long-players, the perfect debut. Between a corrugated cardboard facia and thin, bleeding shell, the bands first CD was sheathed in a white paper slipcase, each of its 1,000 copies entwined with a single blue-tip match. \"The cardboard was lifted from alleys and dumpsters... wherever we could find it. We cut it, stamped it, and assembled the packaging.\"\nA sickeningly, painfully simple reconstruction of all the music thats ever really Mattered, The Constantines announced the Best Band in the World, and we-- critics, caricatures and cunts-- have been foaming at the mouth to crown another one for twenty years now. Fearlessly quoting Rod Stewart in a ballsy appropriation of slick, vocalist Bry Webb throatily blasted altruistic credos like \"forget your rock culture stuck in tow.../ Its boredom beyond measure.\"\nMost often (and accurately) labeled a Fugazi/Springsteen hybrid (just add a touch of Svenonius), The Constantines are resurrecting rock music from the frigid, faggy dungeon currently overrun with a thousand self-obsessed, coke-snorting keyboard players. Nailing fashion victims to the wall, these tireless, traditionally bent cads effortlessly reclaim the sexiness and sexuality of rock rhythms, wresting abandon from effeminate black-and-dayglo pretenders, righteously reacquainting us with the filthy, sinister roots of the medium. Theirs is the sound of craven, drunk friend-fucking, of smoky, dead all-night bars and wondering how to keep the party going.\n\"On to You\" is the most immediately, emotionally resonant piece here, nominally recognizing its own merit, boldly incanting \"sha la la, sha la la, ooooooooooh\" over a mounting finale. Wind-swept, it combines the passion of almighty Bruce, the gutsy indie aggression of Archers of Loaf and the glacially cool depression of modern UK pop acts, forging a new, gritty alternative to Britains overproduced ballads. You would hear beer glasses topple in this cerebral, shady bar; you would cough away smoke or rudely contribute it, eagerly waiting for resolution, grinning knowingly with every chorus, submitting.\nThe advance single \"Nighttime/Anytime (Its Alright)\" slits the throats of a thousand false prophets; filthy back room keyboards wheeze through decades of dust behind the bands signature, hard-panned electric guitars, fighting as brothers, betraying each other. Webb is still mining the streets for his hugely dramatic, beat poet lyrics, and they work as literature. \"With one foot in the gutter/ The city is my sister/ The nighttime is my lover.\" The timeless adages Webb pens-- and even those he borrows-- are traditional and instantly classic, conveying both the desperate state of rock and roll and the majesty of its imaginary pasts.\nShine a Light may be a shade inferior to its predecessor, bogged down by a superfluous Question Mark \u0026 The Mysterians organ and awkward female vocals, but while considerably looser, theres an obvious effort to break with the past, to look forward for inspiration and improvement. This also means its markedly transistional, experimenting with brilliant ideas too seldom trusted. Still, its all too easy for The Constantines, a band so filthy, gritty and raw, they can only fail upwards.\nUnlike the chic Strokes or pretentious Interpol, they are truly opening their hearts, pining desperately for the rest of us to join in (or at least bear witness to) their memorial for rock and roll, an artform consumed by its fans, all desperate for a glimpse of its glory. Though not quite the slap in the face issued by their debut, even this albums very worst song shines a light on whats wrong with our landscape. Find it and follow.",

        "article_text": "So, the titles just a pun. Peter Morén, Bjorn Yttling, and John Erikkson all wrote songs for their third album, Writers Block, but where last years heartbroken Falling Out drew inspiration mainly from 1960s pop, the Stockholm-based trios latest LP finds them aspiring to new levels of sonic diversity, exploring everything from lo-fi 80s electronics and shoegaze guitars to slacker beats and icy dreamscapes. Its a lot of new ground for a band to have covered in a years time; fortunately, PB\u0026J (uh, yeah, we know) managed to harness their melodic expertise and cultivate their textural craftsmanship at precisely the same time. The result is their most focused and fully realized effort yet-- an album that adds an imperial hugeness to the teen noir and garage-y psychedelia of their past efforts-- and one of the better pop records weve heard this year.\nAided by Yttlings solid production (hes also worked with the Concretes and Shout Out Louds), Writers Blocks sonic textures demand attention first: odd synths, overdriven bass, dreamy harmonies, rolling drums, pink streaks of guitar noise, or a foot tapping in soft focus. But ultimately, the album is just as notable for the way it captures both the electric first moments of a deep relationship and the bleary aftermath of post-breakup malaise. The infectious, lazily whistled hook and playful bongo drums of first single \"Young Folks\" are immediately inviting, but the songs second layer-- the coy chemistry between Morén and ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman-- adds depth, as the songs two hopeful strangers discover each other by chance: \"All we care about is talking/ Talking only me and you.\"\nAs an album, Writers Block shares these new lovers singular focus. \"Paris 2004\" is a classical guitar-tinged travelers ballad in the manner of John Cales near-perfect \"Andalucia\", exchanging Cales studied ambiguity for sentimental bedazzlement; Erikksons \"Start to Melt\" flickers with amazed adoration; and Moréns \"Objects of My Affection\" combines the dramatic flair of an uncharacteristically upbeat Morrissey with the nasal vocals and ringing acoustic guitars of a post-Loveless \"Like a Rolling Stone\".\nThe albums narrators cast an equally attentive eye on loves jagged downside. Amid the simplistic percussion and glassy Flaming Lips chorus of \"Amsterdam\", Yttling mopes over his loneliness during a lovers vacation, before Erikksons starry-eyed \"Up Against the Wall\" pictures a relationship at the precipice. \"Its almost that I wish we hadnt met at all,\" sings Erikkson against a crystalline rhythm that could pack a John Hughes prom.\nWritten by the full trio, \"The Chills\" pays quiet homage to the New Zealand indie group of the same name, and steeps its bitterness in caustic one-liners (\"Your tongue is sharp/ But I miss the taste of it\"). And at last, Yttlings big-screen \"Roll the Credits\" pictures an escape, but as usual on Writers Block, the romance fills the frame: \"Its between me and her now/ Cant separate at all/ Lets put the cards back in the sleeve.\" Only droning closer \"Poor Cow\" kills the mood, like the George Harrison sitar song contrarians might revisit when the rest of the album grows overly familiar.\nFor Peter Bjorn \u0026 John-- as with their Pitchfork-approved compatriots-- love is all. As such, a certain amount of actual writers block should have been expected; after all, what Writers Block seeks to portray is, in the end, ineffable. \"And the question is: Was I more alive then than I am now?\" Morén wonders on \"Objects of My Affection\", rejoindering, \"I happily have to disagree/ I laugh more often now/ I cry more often now/ I am more me.\" If lyric poetry is, as Czech novelist Milan Kundera recently wrote, \"the most exemplary incarnation of man dazzled by his own soul and the desire to make it heard,\" surely the pop song is the highest incarnation of all-consuming love and its fundamental need to be shared. Writers Block, indeed.",

        "article_text": "Ladies and gentlemen, please switch off your irony detectors. The Exploding Hearts are not tongue-in-cheek punk-pop revivalists, and they arent postmodern pastiche artists borrowing an abandoned aesthetic for the sake of cultural commentary. In fact, from their bright pink-and-yellow album art to their shamelessly Sex Pistols-esque poses, The Exploding Hearts make it clear from the outset that theyre not too concerned with being taken seriously-- by you or anybody.\nAt first glance, it would be easy to write off the Exploding Hearts as another pop/punk band that never mentally evolved past the 10th grade. But on their debut full-length, Guitar Romantic, the ridiculous geekdom that comes through the Hearts \"cool\" façade like grease through a Big Mac wrapper pays off in spades, as the Portland four-piece cuts right to the energetic heart of power-pop, evoking vintage Soft Boys, The Only Ones, and-- though undoubtedly through sheer coincidence-- The Apples in Stereos first seven-inches.\nThe first thing youre likely to notice about Guitar Romantic is the production. Its clipped-out and fuzzy, burying the VU needle at +3. Theres no subtlety to be found here: Everything is pushed so far to the top of the mix that the instruments all blend together into a fuzzy two-dimensional sonic image. In this context, the sound works perfectly-- theres no reason anything here should be anywhere except at the front. With all the instruments appropriately (or, perhaps, inappropriately) loud, the focus falls squarely on the songs themselves, which is where The Exploding Hearts namesake becomes all too fitting.\nThe band wastes no time kicking your ass, either: The opener, \"Modern Kicks\", is easily one of Guitar Romantics best tracks, and perfectly exemplifies what makes this bands music so infectious. With its driving rhythm and insanely catchy vocal hook delivered in a bratty faux-English accent, the song plays out like an anthemically poppy and distinctly American incarnation of The Buzzcocks. But Guitar Romantic peaks with \"Sleeping Aides and Razor Blades\", mining the energetic melodies of everything from Big Star to Nick Lowe to the misplaced 50s-isms and lobotomized abandon of The Ramones.\nThere are points throughout Guitar Romantic where parallels could be drawn to The Strokes, and indeed, the two bands seem to be working from a pretty similar tradition. But where The Strokes embody a self-conscious, affected \"cool\" that involves preening their hair to make it look like they just woke up, and their music sometimes seems similarly premeditated and self-conscious, The Exploding Hearts simply have no shame. These guys indulge in power-pop like true hedonists, their unmitigated passion for the music negating any shred of the hipness their influences imply. At first, its confounding that a band with such a keen sense of songcraft would adopt a style aesthetic that combines punk cliché with an L.A. Looks advertisement, but their style, like their sound, comes across as a product of unabashed enthusiasm and near-ridiculous reverence for the music.\nAll this discussion, of course, seems irrelevant when the records playing. At the end of the day, Guitar Romantic is simply a fucking awesome power-pop record that wouldve been just as relevant and engaging twenty-five years ago, and will undoubtedly be just as fun twenty-five years down the road. It may seem glaringly retro on the surface, but The Exploding Hearts have released an album that is, at its core, ageless.\n ",

        "article_text": "Tim Heckers fourth full-length under his own name isnt so much a new direction as a refinement. The differences between 2002s Haunt Me Haunt Me, Do It Again, 2003s Radio Amor, and 2004s Mirages are apparent but incremental. On each of these records, Hecker plays with pink-into-white noise, tinkling synths that float between the speakers, the occasional over-the-airwaves voice, and knotty samples of guitar with the Earth-drone pedal pushed to the jet-black metal.\nBut while Hecker continues to revisit some of the same sonic elements, he also seems to be listening closely to what works and playing with structure. So his latest record, Harmony in Ultraviolet, has none of the docile synth instrumentals he borrowed from Brian Eno on his debut, nor the ultimately distracting disembodied radio chatter from the follow-up. Rather, hes taken whats left and focused, zoomed in, amplified, and stretched.\nHarmony is, paradoxically, Heckers most dramatic and most oceanic record. The former implies twists, arc, and carefully planned change intended to evoke specific effects; the latter suggests stasis, immersion, and a state of dreamy contemplation. Harmony manages to be both these things by surprising as it mesmerizes, with Hecker reigning in or tempering any jarring effects just enough to keep the self-obliterating sense of endless drone intact. One key is that the tension never really dissipates, varying only in degree and quality. The opening \"Rainbow Blood\" sets the scene with a screeching and trebly drone, like an orchestra tuning up in the darkened theater where Rebecca del Rio performed in Mulholland Drive, and for the next 48 minutes, Harmony keeps the pulse elevated.\nTuneful passages like the Tangerine Dream sonata \"Chimeras\" leading into the Windy \u0026 Carl-like blissout of \"Dungeoneering\" have a relatively lulling effect, but the mood remains dark and uneasy. The four-part \"Harmony in Blue\" at the albums center, which starts nice and warm, is like a gradually descending slope into a coal black pit. The first section begins with gently modulating drones and only a bare minimum of glitchy accents; the second is dubby and aquatic, with upper harmonics lopped off; the third is a slightly lighter and wispier; and the fourth gathers an increasingly thick blanket of distortion around chilly, held tones.\nBy the time the suite has finished, the record is zipping along on a tightly ratcheted wire, which leads to the heightened drama of the final act. When the floor gives way following \"Harmony in Blue IV\", during the explosive \"Radio Spiricon\", it can seem nearly breathtaking, especially at higher volumes. Heckers synths here are massive, sounding like something huge thats been torn in half with great force, exposing a bouquet of prickly and splayed binding material. Were suddenly seeing the guts of the thing, the album turned inside out. That the following \"Whitecaps of White Noise\" gets even crazier with its surges of distortion but then bleeds into a funeral organ drone only adds to the emotional punch. This closing 22-minute suite is some of the finest abstract electronic music of the laptop era.\nWhat Hecker delivers when hes at his loudest and most noise-drunk is the thing that will always bring to mind My Bloody Valentine: a sense of submitting to oblivion. The violence inside tracks like \"Spring Heeled Jack Flies Tonight\" and the rougher bits in the \"Whitecaps\" section is oddly comforting, like it shows a way to tune into and accept the destructive chaos of nature. That this racket which Hecker specializes in-- top-heavy with prickly static, a dark undercurrent of synths providing a wobbly foundation beneath-- can engender such a pleasant sense of surrender is the key to his appeal. Harmony in Ultraviolet is sensual body music of a very particular kind, and its the sort of record that asks a lot. But if you trust it and go along, it knows exactly where to lay its hands.",

        "article_text": "Fleet Foxes may have a firm grasp on rock and folk history, but they never play to their record collection. Rather than revive a particular scene or re-create a lost sound, the Seattle quintet cherrypick their ideas from a broad spectrum of styles, pulling in Appalachian folk, classic rock, AM country, and SoCal pop to create a personal synthesis of the music of their peers, their parents, and even their grandparents.\nThe band didnt leave town to record Fleet Foxes, yet it sounds like it could have been recorded anywhere in the United States-- Austin, Minneapolis, Chicago, Brooklyn, Louisville, or more likely some clearing in the woods. That placelessness constitutes an active effacement, considering that Seattle has been a locus for alternative music for nearly two decades. The five-piece is thoroughly embedded in that scene: Their ranks include current and former members of Crystal Skulls, Pedro the Lion, and Seldom. Furthermore, to produce the sessions that created the Sun Giant EP and this debut LP, they hired Phil Ek, best known for his work with Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, and the Shins. Nevertheless, theirs is a studiously rural aesthetic, eschewing urban influences and using reverb like sepia-tone to suggest something much older and more rustic than it really is. The album opens with a short tune (titled \"Red Squirrel\" on early leaks but not listed on the CD) that could be a field recording sung by a small-town congregation 50 years ago. It ushers us into Fleet Foxes old world; after a few bars, the song darts into the heraldic \"Sun It Rises\", which sure enough sounds like someones idea of a sunrise over an evergreen mountain. But theyre not done yet: Just as the song fades, it rises into a quiet coda that previews two more elements of their sound-- the patient guitar lick on \"Blue Ridge Mountains\" and the vocal harmonies that color numerous songs on the record. All thats missing are the crackles and hisses of an old LP. (Fortunately, Sub Pop is issuing it on vinyl.)\nWhat follows is surprisingly full and wide ranging, almost as much as the Bruegel painting that graces the albums cover. Skye Skjelsets guitar roams wherever it pleases, while drummer Nicholas Peterson keeps the songs in check, allowing the band to move freely but not wander too far into the woods. A flute, half-submerged in the mix, adds lurking menace to the albums most intense jam, \"Your Protector\", and Casey Wescotts staccato piano rhythm runs through \"Blue Ridge Mountains\", heightening the momentum of the chorus.\nFor all the albums winding paths and unexpected vistas, Fleet Foxes harmonies remain the primary draw, and theyve written and arranged these songs to showcase their shared vocals. \"Heard Them Stirring\" has no lyrics, but its hard to call it an instrumental. Against a shuffling shaker-and-tambourine rhythm, \"Ragged Wood\" switches between Robin Pecknolds lead vocals and the bands harmonies after each verse, effectively translating classic rock via folk elements. Theres as much Fleetwood Mac as the Band in the songs rousing finale. On the other hand, Fleet Foxes do restraint just as well: \"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\" features only a lone acoustic guitar and Pecknolds forceful vocals, which switch to a spooky falsetto on the outro.\nVocals play such a primary role in Fleet Foxes music that Pecknolds lyrics at times sound like merely a delivery system for harmonies, with references to meadowlarks, rising suns, and streams bolstering the rural and placeless evocations. However, these are ultimately carefully and well-crafted compositions. On \"White Winter Hymnal\", a firelit roundelay that best showcases the bands vocal interplay, the lyrics convey strange, almost Edward Gorey-like imagery: \"I was following the pack/ All swallowed in their coats/ With scarves of red tied round their throats/ To keep their little heads from falling in the snow/ And I turned round and there you go.\" Who knows exactly what the words mean, but the fairy-tale menace comes through in full color, and Petersons floor-tom beat and the intricacy of the bands harmonies dispel the threat without diluting the mystery.",

        "article_text": "Even for those of us who go all the way back to “8 Steps to Perfection” and “The Whole World”, its starting to feel like El-P and Killer Mike have always been talked about in the same breath. The connection makes a kind of retroactive sense going back to their early 2000s solo debuts, Fantastic Damage and Monster. Both albums seethed with the anxious funk of retrofuture 808s-and-synths production that rattled trunks and cages with unrestrained intensity. And both portrayed the artists as out-of-control forces trying their damnedest to stay true to friends, family, and hip-hop while confronting disenfranchisement, abuse, and cynicism. That their creators would gravitate towards collaboration makes even more sense now than it does with hindsight in mind, as the 1-2 hooks to the head of Cancer for Cure and R.A.P. Music shared not just a producer and a timeframe, but the kind of catharsis-fueled defiance that career no-sellout vets live and breathe.\nThankfully, El-P and Killer Mike made a point to keep working together, and by all accounts their two-MCs/one-producer teamup Run the Jewels was meant to be some kind of “cool-down” record-- just something they could brainstorm up and record as a sort of fun, no-stress victory lap in celebration of a triumphant 2012. But if that kind of session reads as a low-stakes slack-off, especially in the form of a free 33-minute download, keep in mind just what constitutes “fun” for these guys. At the top of the list, its the process-- workshopping ideas, putting things together, delivering them with conviction, and bringing it out to a rampant fanbase prone to drawing irreverent fan-art and ordering special-edition herb grinders. No excuse to relax here.\nThe only significant sign that El-P and Killer Mike are taking things “easier” on this album is the focus on shit-talk: aside from the confessional coming-of-age self-pep talk of closer “A Christmas Fucking Miracle”, theres little-to-no high-concept storytelling and a minimum of “Reagan”/”Drones Over Bklyn”-style political science. They havent gotten complacent-- that latter song gets fleetingly referenced in a Mike line on “DDFH”, one of the few verses that catches the same police-state anger that R.A.P. Music did. And El still raps like somebody whos not sure if hes the last sane man or the craziest man on earth, carrying his refined maniacal diatribes over from Cancer for Cure. But the majority of Run the Jewels is a succession of throw-shit-out-a-window anthems which take the early-LL knuckles-first bragging that inspired the name, running their own psilocybin-tinged mean streak through it.\nThe deepest messages of Run the Jewels are the ones dedicated to figuring out just how many ways there are to threaten bodily trauma in the most over-the-top language possible while not actually coming across like some screwfaced shock-value manchild. It feels as though the options of either catching a bad one or riding with them are easier to decide between because the latter sounds like itd be a hell of a time anyways. And theres this sense of friendly, unspoken one-upsmanship between the two MCs that keeps upping the stakes. Mike on the title track: “Ill pull this pistol, put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby.” El on “Sea Legs”: “Try to pet my fuckin head again and Ima put a tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with.” Mike on “Get It”: “stupid goofy stoolie, the gooch in Gucci will slap you/ and that go for the cop-kissing cats thats in the back of you.” El on “Twin Hype Back”: “Me and Mikell go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipe/ put your fuckin jazz hands back in your pants or get them shits sliced.” Its a game of the dozens where the barbs are aimed outwards and funny-looking moms are swapped for an all-encompassing People Who Fuck With Us category.\nIn the process, both MCs have both started to meet each other halfway personality-wise, though that wasnt a long trip to begin with. Els panic-attack rasp has grown into this fluid delivery thats become as immersive as his older hitched-timing flow was, spitting slick bars and doubletimes that make the acidic comedy roll out like his own take on vintage Ludacris. And Mike maintains his wrecking-ball mode, but twists it into moments of psychedelic delirium and over-the-top throat tearing, a man incapable of sounding nonchalant about anything getting the chance to turn that elbow-throwing flow into the narrator for a story about getting a lapdance on mushrooms (“No Come Down”) or turning it up to the breaking point on the grimy Tyson-isms of “Job Well Done”. When they get into verse-swapping back-and-forths on “Twin Hype Back”, “Get It”, and “Banana Clipper” (where an otherwise excellent Big Boi verse bizarrely feels like an afterthought in comparison), or throw around conversational line-finishing asides elsewhere, the rapports enough to raise questions as to why this teamup was supposed to be unusual in the first place.\nThis is hardhead music, but its also supposed to be a good time-- shit, they even brought in Prince Paul to do his oily weirdo pick-up artist Chest Rockwell routine on “Twin Hype Back”. (“I got your glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards... how bout I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway?”) So El-P pulls out the stops in making the abrasive, heavy aspects of his production sound boombox-ready. If this stuffs “dystopian,” you might as well book a party bus to Airstrip One: growling synthesized basslines do the heavy lifting as percussion skitters beneath like warped distortions of the 84, 96, and 02 versions of analog hip-hop, a cohesive sound that serves as a reminder that Georgia and New York are both technically East Coast. Els signature production touches-- minor-key chord drones, ligament-snapping guitar squalls, highwire arpeggios, twitchy drum patterns that are as restless as a rock-solid beat can get-- are put to pretty straightforward use this time around.\nThe beats fit the blueprint of R.A.P. Musics tendency to let the voices supply most of the brute force; it still bumps like a bastard, but not in the kind of way that had Yeezus casualties scrambling for punk rock namedrops. Its just a distilled take on everything that made last years albums such an event, with all the chrome ripped off and upholstery pulled out so itll run faster, louder, nastier. Yeah, its a fun album, and its probably the most affable thing theyve done so far together. But dont take that for a weakness. They dont yank chains-- they snatch them.",

        "article_text": "Something must have happened to Manitobas Dan Snaith. His 2001 debut for the Leaf label, Start Breaking My Heart, was blissed-out pastoral IDM that warranted Boards of Canada comparisons. Then he went off and made some clubby tracks that dabbled in UK garage. And now, with his second full-length Up in Flames, hes chucked the laptop, dug the analog gear out of the dumpster, and recorded a 60s-worshiping indie pop record, complete with sun-kissed harmonies, layered acoustic guitars, Farfisa organ drones and glockenspiel. You have to admire the chutzpah. Seriously, I cant remember hearing this stark a contrast between consecutive albums in a long time, maybe ever.\nThe sound of Up in Flames is key. In contrast to the world of modern computer-based music, where noise is precisely controlled and each layered instrument can be mentally plucked from the mix and examined, Up in Flames is a colossal field of unified sound. The sheets of acoustic guitar and organ wrap themselves around the booming drums (mostly acoustic kits tuned to the full timbre of the Hal Blaine era) and you cant pry them apart. The obvious production inspirations are Phil Spector and Brian Wilson, both of whom arranged songs during a time when men had more ideas than available tracks; producers were forced to cheat in those days-- to bounce and to compress-- and the best records to come out of that period were massive and unknowable as a result. Up in Flames, whether by choice or necessity, has the same warm feeling of ramshackle Wagner. When it came time to record, precision was clearly a goal far down the list.\nDespite their obvious 60s references, most of the tracks on Up in Flames arent really songs in the traditional sense. Instead of prominent verse/chorus/bridge structures, we hear a series of swells and contractions. Snaith has a good understanding of the tricks and techniques of pops biggest and best moments, the moments that stop your breath during the pause just before the big chorus, and he set out to make an album filled with them. \"Hendrix with Ko\" (which is one of a couple songs featuring the voice of Koushik Ghosh) has some lyrics, but most of what you hear are just day-glo bah-bah-bahs that serve as suspension cabling to carry the track from one section to the next, through the Mamas \u0026 Papas homage to an electronic coda thats a rare memory of Manitobas prior incarnation. \"Jacknuggeted\" has a similar arc, but reminds me more of Neil Diamond in his Bang Records days-- all \"Cherry Cherry\" handclaps and stiff-but-funky D/A/G acoustic strumming-- before another digital breakdown brings in sputtering breaks that would have had Greenwich \u0026 Barry lunging for the \"stop\" button.\nAs tied to the 60s as it is, Up in Flames can also be described as \"psychedelic.\" The way the absolutely huge \"Bijoux\" swirls with Wilsonian harmonies, layers of chords, music boxes, percussion explosions and orchestral samples, I swear it almost takes on a Boredoms cast-- not in terms of aggression, but as a primal celebration of the possibility of sound. \"Kid Youll Move Mountains\" is similarly dense, but this one sends a snaking soprano saxophone through the changes. A tenor sax erupts in the latter part of \"Skunks\", tearing off into a series of riffs that add the same sort of \"free\" element to the track that Stereolab incorporated into \"Fuses\". The fuzzy \"Crayon\", meanwhile, sounds like Múm covering The Jesus \u0026 Mary Chains \"Taste of Cindy\".\nIf Snaith were to follow the trend of most electronic producers, hed have changed his alias for this project, the way Atom Heart does with Señor Coconut-- though Ill grant that theres some conceptual overlap: Up in Flames certainly has a wide-eyed and affirmative outlook, and features titles like \"Every Time She Turns Around Its Her Birthday\" to go with Start Breaking My Hearts \"Children Play Well Together\", and there are a few brief moments where Snaiths IDM head pops out of the fabric. But thats as far as it goes; the two albums arent in the same universe. Is Snaith confused? Maybe he wants it all. Maybe he doesnt know what he wants. But because Up in Flames is such a great record, we win either way.\n ",

        "article_text": "What would shoegaze sound like if it had its eyes on the sky? Over the course of several albums, the intercontinental six-piece A Sunny Day in Glasgow have been toying with an answer to that riddle. Their latest and best record, Sea When Absent, has an atmospheric, bleeding-watercolor quality that makes it sound a little bit like a My Bloody Valentine record if the moodiness and pensiveness were replaced with a feeling of almost violently explosive joy. Beneath dense textures, melodies pop like fireworks. Like their previous albums, Sea When Absent doesnt sound like much else out there; genre tags are only worth mentioning to show how they dont quite fit. It sometimes sounds like a psych record, made not by the kids smoking up behind the bleachers but the most devoted members of the glee club.\nSince their freewheeling 2007 debut Scribble Mural Comic Journal, A Sunny Day in Glasgow have flown under the radar, apart from any discernible trends. Until now, their greatest achievement has been their criminally under-heard 2009 album Ashes Grammar, a panoramic collection of pastel-soft dream-pop that moved fluidly between ambient passages and hazy but immaculately structured pop songs like \"Failure\" and \"Passionate Introverts (Dinosaurs)\". Actually, \"passionate introverts\" is a pretty good way to describe at least one member of the band: the guitarist and ostensible leader Ben Daniels, a biostatistician who moved in 2009 from Philadelphia to Australia. \"I am pretty antisocial,\" he said recently, when asked if he still felt connected to the Philadelphia scene. \"I know that if I were in Philly Id still mostly be hanging out in my apartment reading books and playing with synthesizers.\" That makes sense: Even in its most ambitiously full-screen moments, A Sunny Day in Glasgows music has a certain bedroom-pop feel. Community often makes for great art, but music as unique and unclassifiable as ASDIGs usually springs from somebody shutting himself in his room and trusting his own weird way of seeing the world.\nAshes Grammar was a sprawling and occasionally drifting record, but Sea When Absent finds the band tightening up their sound just enough, bringing the interlocking vocals of their two singers, Jen Goma and Annie Fredrickson, to the forefront of the mix. For the first time, theyve brought on an outside producer, Jeff Zeigler (War on Drugs, Kurt Vile), and though hes helped clarify their sound, that doesnt come at the expense of complexity. Each song on Sea When Absent structured like a maze: its easy—and dizzying in the best way—to get lost in its twists and turns. \"The Things They Do to Me\" begins as weightless, space-rock reverie and then abruptly makes a hard left into a more pastoral earth-bound soundscape; \"The Body, It Bends\" pivots between an unassuming acoustic folk tune and a song that ought to have its own laser light show at a planetarium; a towering riff crashes down in the middle of \"Boys Turn Into Girls (Initiation Rites)\", sudden as a summer storm. These tonal shifts are so dynamic that they sound fresh on every listen; you could hear these songs 100 times and theyd still find ways to catch by surprise.\nMusic that overflows with so many ideas runs the risk of sounding cluttered, but Sea When Absent manages to avoid that pitfall. And thats pretty impressive, given the disjointed way it was recorded: The six members of the band (Daniels, Goma, Fredrickson, drummer Adam Herndon, bassist Ryan Newmyer, and multi-instrumentalist Josh Meakim) are now scattered across Australia, New York, and Philadelphia, and the album came together as they sent each other snippets of songs, with creative decisions made via lengthy group email chains. The result is an album structured in layers with many overlapping ideas, as fragmentary and luminous as light through a prism. The sweetly singsong-y \"MTLOV (Minor Keys)\" has the feel of a round, with Goma and Fredricksons voices braided into rich harmonies. Then theres the stone-cold gorgeous \"In Love With Useless (The Timeless Geometry in the Tradition of Passing)\", which flirts with moments of dissonance and glitchiness (the pre-chorus sounds like nothing so much as a poorly connected Skype call) only to make the moments of sudden clarity feel that much more satisfying.\nWhen A Sunny Day in Glasgow put out \"In Love With Useless\" as a single, they also released a lyric video for it—which is kind of funny, because theyre not exactly a \"lyrics band.\" Granted, theyve pushed the vocals higher into the mix this time around, but its usually next to impossible to understand what Goma and Fredrickson are singing. Not that it matters; ASDIGs music is more about the experience of getting blissfully lost in a feeling, and if their music were too literal or word-based it might take you out of that odd, dreamlike state.\n\"When Ashes Grammar came out,\" Daniels recently recalled, \"I thought it was a really loud rock record for a year, and then a friend was like, This is really chilled-out and ambient.\" With Sea When Absent, A Sunny Day in Glasgow have finally made that loud rock record—full of crashing percussion and screaming guitars—but without abandoning the ambiance that makes them so distinct. Sea When Absent has the quality of one of those spectacularly bright summer days when they color in everything seems a little over-saturated, and it induces the same dizzy, woozy feeling you get after staring directly at the sun. Play it loud enough to see spots.",

        "article_text": "The Sopranos ended. The United States elected an African-American president. The global financial system more or less keeled over. The U.S. stopped sending people into space and \"got\" Osama Bin Laden, both in the same year. Harry Potter peaced out-- twice. Zach Braffs career shit the bed. Martin Scorcese won an Oscar, finally. Jeff Mangum returned. R.E.M., LCD Soundsystem, the White Stripes-- called it quits, all of em. Michael Jackson died, and so did Whitney Houston. Pop music headed out to the club, mainstream hip-hop more or less went bust, people started buying more vinyl (and, to a lesser extent, cassettes), and \"indie\" culture traded its guitars for turntables (or, at the very least, pirated audio software and synthesizers that didnt take up too much space in the bedroom).\nA lot can happen in five years, the amount of time since the Shins released their last album, the eclectic and overlooked Wincing the Night Away. During that stretch, the bands primary songwriter and sole constant member, James Mercer, also went digital. In 2010, he teamed up with Brian \"Danger Mouse\" Burton to form Broken Bells, a collaboration that has led to an album and an EP, both of which were light on things like \"songs\" and \"choruses.\" The problem with Broken Bells is that it took up so much of Mercers time and didnt provide a proper outlet for one of big-tent indie pops strongest songwriters. For a few years, the idea of a new (never mind good) Shins album seemed unlikely. Mercer sounded hopelessly adrift.\nA deep breath, then: James Mercer has returned to Earth. Port of Morrow, the Shins fourth studio album in 11 years, is a triumphant return from a project that once risked being reduced to an indie-went-mainstream tagline. Its the perfect distillation of the Shins back catalog-- the jangly, wistful airs of Oh, Inverted World, Chutes Too Narrows genre-resistant playfulness, Wincing the Night Aways expansively detailed production. But in other ways, its colorful, detail-oriented approach sets it apart from anything Mercers done before.\nMercer invited a cast of characters both new (Janet Weiss, production wiz Greg Kurstin, singer/songwriter Nik Freitas) and old (Modest Mouses Joe Plummer, Fruit Bats Eric D. Johnson, on-and-off supporting players Marty Crandall and Dave Hernandez) to realize his ornate pop-rock creations. All contributions are felt-- you dont need liner notes to tell how many people worked on this thing-- but none more so than Kurstins. His multi-instrumental arrangements and behind-the-boards know-how are what make Port of Morrow one of 2012s best-sounding records thus far. Every element here is tricked out for maximum emotional effect-- experience total power-pop pleasure overload from \"Simple Song\"s acrobatic pile of guitars, get the chills from the drifting sea breeze-echo of \"September\", and wrap yourself in \"For a Fool\"s string-laden lushness. Needless to say, these songs would sound great on Natalie Portmans humongous headphones.\nOf course, Kurstin wouldnt matter if the raw materials werent so strong: Mercer (who also co-produced) delivers the goods, mostly by being himself. Hes either missed out on the last few years of indies ever-shifting microtrends or simply doesnt care about \"the conversation.\" And thank fucking god for that. More so than any other Shins album, Port of Morrow doesnt sound like it belongs to any particular decade or style, instead hopping around like some fully loaded AM radio dial that cranks out gem after gem. Theres the sugary new-wave \"Bait and Switch\", \"No Way Down\"s meat-and-potatoes American pop-rock (right down to the \"Jack \u0026 Diane\"-biting guitar hook), the title tracks creeping psych-soul bombast. Most surprisingly, theres \"Fall of 82\", a Steve Miller Band-meets-Chicago lite-rock hybrid-- muted trumpet solo!-- that also works as a \"Summer of 69\" update. (These are all good things.)\nLyrically, Ive always thought of James Mercer as a cousin of A.C. Newman, another songwriter with a gift for spinning gold from the sounds from the past. Newmans never been shy about writing kinda-nonsensical lyrics that simply sound good accompanying a solid melody (think \"Sing Me Spanish Techno\", or \"Submarines of Stockholm\"). Although Wincing the Night Away had dark undertones drawn from Mercers personal life, hes got a similar knack for writing beautiful words that dont need to mean anything in particular. Along with its other strong points, Port of Morrow proves he hasnt lost that talent, especially when rhapsodizing on matters of the heart. \"Simple Song\" and \"Fall of 82\" score points for sharp, nostalgic description, but \"September\" is the real winner, a straightforward stunner of stumbling affection with a shining pearl of a couplet buried within: \"Love is the ink in the well/ When her body writes.\"\nDespite all the hullabaloo about band members getting \"fired,\" the fact is that Mercer isnt a member of the Shins-- he is the Shins, and he always has been. In a recent interview, he expressed his frustration over how to represent that specificity: \"Bands I really loved were these auteurs who presented themselves as bands-- Neutral Milk Hotel, the Lilys-- and I just felt, Why am I not allowed to do that?\" Consider Port of Morrow, then, the results of an auteurs accepting that role while having a load of fun with his friends in order to realize it. Comeback stories dont get much better than that.",

        "article_text": "Every few years, theres a trend among bandnames, a recurring word or theme that hits the undergrounds collective consciousness like a slap on the forehead, only to saturate record shelves and concert bills to the point of parody. For British alternapop groups in the early 90s, Jesus saved, while those bearing giddy power-pop later in the decade were invariably dubbed \"super.\" Lately, theres been an influx of repetition (Xiu Xiu, Man Man, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and \"black\" bands (Black Dice, Black Keys, Black Eyes, Black Mountain), but increasingly, groups find themselves indebted to creatures of nature (Gorillaz, Deerhoof, Doves, Caribou, Pelican), and particularly wolves. So in a period during which the animal kingdom permeates the independent aesthetic, its hard not to admire the band that takes a big-picture approach: Welcome to the Wilderness.\nFormed three years ago in Baltimore, a city increasingly known for its thriving club music community, the art-rock four-piece builds off the history of pre-adolescent post-rock-- not the academic jazz-inflected instrumentals or orchestral crescendos associated with the genre today, but rather post-rock as defined in the early 90s by music journalist Simon Reynolds, a scene in which bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Disco Inferno applied guitars more for their aqueous, saturated textures and tones than for rigid pop structures.\nLike those bands, Wilderness deploy spacial, dream-like atmospheres and ominous ethereality over cymbals that shimmer and splash against tom-heavy drum patterns. Brooding, artstruck guitars ring out from the depths, echoing the swirling neo-psych of Echo and the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. But when frontman James Johnson breaks like headlights through the mist, the picture shifts from bliss-out watercolor to black-streaked oil canvas: Channeling the primal weirdness of a young David Byrne, or the unhinged proclamations of Public Image Ltds John Lydon, his words are more announced than sung, and like a number of Eno-era Talking Heads tracks, he often relies on distinctive sing/speak cadences in lieu of tightly structured vocal melodies.\nRising, falling, and lifting again, Johnsons silvery howl rides the bands iridescent, rainswept instrumentation like a cresting tide, obscuring lyrics that alternate between abstract expressionism and fatalistic, anti-political rhetoric. Its a fantastic technique, but also a risky one: On cursory listens, many listeners could find the album beautifully lush-- even pioneering-- yet still be somewhat put off by the seeming atonality of Johnsons unusual style. But thats where the pleasant surprise lies: As these songs begin to settle in deeper, his vocal topography unexpectedly yields tons of melody where there initially may have seemed to be very little.\nKicking in with an authoritative snare, a pause, and an explosive combination of smashed cymbal, walking bass, and stratospheric guitarwork, \"Marginal Over\" brightly broadcasts Wilderness arrival, but it doesnt take long for things to turn darker: The doom-stricken \"Arkless\" lies at the heels of the opener, and just around the corner from that is one of the albums greatest-- and gravest-- standouts, the urgent, desolate \"End of Freedom\", which finds Johnson at his most animated and desperate, insistently commanding \"the hand over the fist.\" Later, in \"Fly Further to See\", the band ascends from the murk, emerging with triumph and radiant guitar lines, before closing out the record with the experimental solo piano piece \"Mirrored Palm\".\nOf course, while Wilderness are certainly unique, and prove themselves dynamic within their own strict parameters, a bit more variety wouldnt hurt, nor would more of the kind of melodic infusion found at the apex of \"End of Freedom\". But considering the original sound theyve created-- and at such an early stage of their career-- its difficult to find too much fault: Even given this level of sonic consistency, the album only drags once, briefly, during the eight-minute centerpiece \"Post Plethoric Rhetoric\"-- and thats at the beginning, before the track manages to get fully off the ground.\nWhat Wilderness really seem to signify-- and what makes them important-- is a shift back towards the more cerebral end of the rock spectrum. Every extreme has its antidote, and just as its been rewarding to see artists loosen up, enjoy themselves, and have some fun for once, its also refreshing to hear them aspiring, just as passionately, to music of a more serious persuasion. In an environment thats reveled so long in the comfortability of tradition and flavor-of-the-month transitiveness, this kind of substantive art-rock is ripe for exploration. If Wilderness arent quite kings of the mountain yet, it might just be that few others have yet traversed their fertile domain.\n ",

        "article_text": "Maybe no one told Clap Your Hands Say Yeah that first impressions are important. Or maybe theyve just got massive sack. Either way, their self-released, self-titled debut CD opens with the weirdest, most potentially grating bit of snake-oil salesmanship youre likely to hear until Tom Waits puts out another record. I happen to dig the song, entitled \"Clap Your Hands!\" (a theme is emerging), but a maniacal carny barking over a stuttering calliope isnt for everyone. Those who persevere, though, will quickly discover that this garish foyer gives out onto spacious, elegant chambers of clean lines and soft lights.\nClap Your Hands are a five-piece from Brooklyn whore known to break out both harp and harmonica. Theyve recently been garnering rave press in their home city, and, over just the past two weeks, burning up the internet like a vintage Lohan nipslip. The pundits are saying Wilco (not hearing it), Talking Heads (okay), and Neutral Milk Hotel (getting warmer), but if it checks in with a number of modern and classic new wave referents, the music sings for itself: Clap Your Hands traffics in melodic, exuberant indie rock that pairs the shimmering, wafting feel of Yo La Tengo with a singular vocal presence that sounds like Paul Banks attempting to yodel through Jeff Mangums throat. Or imagine the Arcade Fire if their music were more fun-loving and less grave.\nOf course, if Clap Your Hands had a press kit, it would undoubtedly include something about \"synthesizing these influences into a sound thats uniquely their own.\" And for once, it would be true. On the albums first true song, \"Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away\", a wailing vocal evokes Walkmen frontman Hamilton Leithauser, as hitching, muted guitars and singing melodic ones twist and furl over throbbing bass. On \"Over and Over Again (Lost and Found)\", the band veers into more Interpol-ish territory, with small, stripped guitars and bass, a thin synth wash, and lilting vocals with woozily yawning vowels. Same goes for the iridescent guitars, purring synths, and weary vocals of \"Details of the War\".\nThe record is consistently, remarkably strong, but \"The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth\" in particular stands out, with its richly buzzing synth phrases, textbook Modest Mouse guitar lead (a trebly, gliding string bend skimming over the rhythm like a flat stone over a pond), contrapuntal bass, and shuffling drums. The song also features one of vocalist Alec Ounsworths most memorable performances: He ramps up the urgency as the heavier chords kick in, his voice cracking and shifting in cascading waves as if someone were pressing his vocal cords to a fret board and bending them. \"Is This Love?\", with its clean, galloping guitars and fruit loop synth trills is the song most blatantly redolent of Neutral Milk Hotel (especially of the unhinged pop and careening vocals Mangum favored on On Avery Island), and its dizzily wowing vocal harmonies carry over to \"Heavy Metal\", where fuzzed-out bass and wheezing harmonica punch smart shapes into the fizzy guitars.\nTheres something really refreshing about stumbling across a great band thats trembling on the cusp without any sort of press campaign or other built-in mythology-- you actually get to hear the music with your own ears. While a lot of bands view the promotional apparatus as a necessary evil, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah prove that its still possible for a band to get heard, given enough talent and perseverance, without a PR agency or a label. Indie rock has received a much-needed kick in the pants, and we have the rare chance to decide what a band sounds like of our own accord before any agency cooks up and disseminates an opinion for us. Damn, maybe this is how its supposed to work!\n ",

        "article_text": "While rap music famously thrives on the kind of drama surrounding this weeks 50 vs. Kanye record-sales standoff, even this showdowns closest followers would probably admit theres something faintly procedural about it. Maybe its because album sales dont really work as a precise measure of absolute popularity anymore. Maybe its because 50s a shadow of his former self and no longer considered among the best, biggest, or most anything. Or maybe its because Universal labelmates 50 and West seem more like theyre doing this for us than for themselves. This is a prize fight between two heavyweight boxers moving in polar-opposite directions; the former weakly flailing through a creative crisis and a serious absence of hunger, the latter trying to transcend America by setting his sights on nothing less than the entire world.\nFor all the pageantry, the most substantial takeaway from Kanyes new album is the realization that he might actually deserve the legendary status he constantly ascribes to himself. Though it doesnt quite match College Dropout or Late Registration in pleasure-center overload, Wests third album in four years is both his most consistent and most enterprising yet. It also caps off an incredible (maybe even unprecedented) run: In terms of consistency, prolificness, and general all-around ability, its hard to find anyone in mainstream rap who can touch what hes achieved within the same timeframe.\nWhere College Dropout and Late Registration mostly functioned as contagious nostaglia trips, Graduation finds him settling into the pocket; instead of looking inside for answers, hes looking out to the world. When he raps \"I shop so much I can speak Italian\" on \"Champion\", its obvious hes holding up worldliness as a point of pride. His production choices reinforce that belief: Here, Kanye splices his well-articulated production style with a brand new set of influences-- most of them European. What he ends up with is a record that splits the difference between two distinctive styles: his familiar strings and brass, helium vocal samples, and warm soul samples on one side; corroded rave stabs, vinegary synth patches, and weirdly modulated electronic noises on the other. (Ironically, the latter all have roots in Wests hometown of Chicago.)\nWhile Graduation is far from the electro-house record some fans predicted when the Daft Punk-sampling \"Stronger\" first leaked, Kanyes interest in French house and rave extend beyond that one track. The stunning \"I Wonder\" combines a gentlemanly, piano-led sample (courtesy of 70s folk/jazz artist Labi Siffre) with a frizzy synth lead and alien-sounding keys, only to drown it all out with a massive swoop of strings; the weirdly dystopian club track \"Drunk and Hot Girls\" lurches along at a snails pace, mixing Cans \"Sing Swan Song\" with a blend of gypsy music and detuned electronics for maximum queasiness; and the string-led \"Flashing Lights\" marries a Bond-worthy coda to staccato sounds and cut-up vocal samples. Where lesser producers have tried to bridge this gap only to wind up with beats that sound like bad mashups, West and co-producer DJ Toomp (T.I., \"What You Know\") make the juxapositions feel utterly natural. Combined with some other familiar source material (\"Champion\", for example, nicks from Steely Dan), that undercurrent of experimentation puts Kanyes talents to good use.\nLyrically, West is magnanimous, corny, self-aggrandizing, and likeable in the all the usual ways. The difference here is that hes dialed down his inner conflict. The neurotic inner monologues of his most engaging verses are virtually absent here. If theres one criticism to be made of Graduation, its that in striving for universality, hes sacrificed a more personal dimension of himself. The only time we even really get close to the mental hand-wringing of his early albums is on the closing \"Big Brother\", where he details his lifelong admiration for Jay-Z and hints at the post-Dropout turbulence between the two, before riffing on his own chorus to conclude: \"My big brother was Bigs brother/ So heres a few words from ya kid brother/ If you admire somebody you should go head and tell em/ People never get the flowers while they can still smell em\".\nOf course, Wests true genius has always come out in his production work, and hearing him find natural ways of fitting these disparate elements together is worth the increased number of Louis Vee brags. While it might not be as substantial a record as were used to hearing from him, it is his greatest leap forward, and further proof that few are as skilled at tracing out the complicated contours of pride, success and ambition as he is.",

        "article_text": "If \"Meet Me in the Dollar Bin\" had been the last song Les Savy Fav ever released, the band would have written themselves a fitting epitaph: \"We got old, but we got good/ And we did all we said we would.\" After the 2004 release of their excellent, career-spanning singles compilation Inches (which featured \"Meet Me in the Dollar Bin\" as its lead track), Les Savy Fav fans feared the band was ready to call it a day. Band members moved apart, live shows became infrequent, and the chances of a proper follow-up to the 2001 full-length Go Forth seemed slim-to-none. So when Les Savy Fav announced that theyd be releasing a new album this year, I was pleasantly surprised; when they revealed Lets Stay Friends solicitous and slyly breakup-referencing title and formidable roster of famous guests... I wasnt as sure. Les Savy Fav are nothing if not smart and self-aware-- could Lets Stay Friends be an expertly plotted careerist cash-in?\nThankfully not. Les Savy Fav have had numerous opportunities to cast themselves as trendsetters and reap the subsequent rewards, and theyve always known better. Their gritty, angular guitar-punk opus Rome (Written Upside Down) was released a year before the Liars They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top. The more refined, disco-inflected Go Forth was released two years before the Raptures Echoes. Les Savy Fav never stuck around to pillage any of the bandwagons they may have set in motion, and they have a stunningly consistent and bullshit-free discography to show for it.\nSo what more can you expect from a band thats done everything they said they would? On album opener \"Pots and Pans\", Harrington answers this question in no uncertain terms: \"Lets tear this whole place down and build it up again/ This bands a beating heart and its nowhere near its end.\" Rather than listlessly rehashing their past achievements or attempting a superficial overhaul, Les Savy Fav are doing something much riskier: Theyre trying to become a better band.\n\"The Equestrian\" fulfills Harringtons promise in both its intensity and its ingenuity, building from a rough-and-tumble verse to a fluid, slinky chorus. While Les Savy Fav once relished in the abrupt and the discontinuous, Lets Stay Friends reveals a surprising amount of elegance. It also shows the band more interested than ever in playing at contrasts and exploring their own range. Harrington always seemed to focus more on rhythm than on melody, but here he proves himself a capable and versatile vocalist. On album standout \"Patty Lee\", Harrington sings the first verse in a playful falsetto and the second in a gravelly yelp. Guitarist Seth Jabour matches him hook for hook, spinning out inventive and melodic guitar lines that owe as much to Archers of Loaf as they do to oft-referenced influence Gang of Four.\nLes Savy Fav have always covered a lot of stylistic ground, but in an effort to further diversify, Lets Stay Friends sometimes finds them focusing on material that doesnt always play to their strengths. The effort is commendable, but the results are mixed: The albums biggest gamble-- and, unfortunately, biggest flop-- is \"Comes and Goes\", a largely drumless duet with Fiery Furnaces frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger. While the prospect of a full-on Les Savy Fav ballad is intriguing, \"Comes and Goes\" sees them struggling to incorporate too many unfamiliar elements and winding up with an uncharacteristically dull experiment not far removed from the Fiery Furnaces less schizophrenic material.\nAs its title cleverly suggests, Lets Stay Friends rewards long-term interest; its not Les Savy Favs most immediate record, nor is it their best. Its the product of a band willing to sacrifice the \"holy shit!\" moment for the fully formed song, to be ambitious without necessarily sounding ambitious, and to become better at the things they dont do best. If Les Savy Fav are as far ahead of the curve here as theyve been in the past, the next couple of years seem to be shaping up well.",

The struggle of DIY indie bands can be over-romanticized, but in the case of Blitzen Trapper, the freedom to work at their own pace is most likely what brought them to come up with the cock-eyed stylistic blitzkrieg of Wild Mountain Nation. The steps up to it have been hesitant: The bands first two albums adhered to both earnest country-derived conventions and a modern disregard for the constraints of genre, somehow reconciling these two impulses to cook up perfectly listenable, if somewhat tentative, pop on tracks like \"Summer Twin\", \"Asleep for Days\", and \"Texaco\", to name a few. But aside from a few songs worth cherry-picking, none showed the work of a group destined for the spotlight-- or, for that matter, capable of deciding between being an alt-country revival act or boundary-blurring experimentalists.\nIts better for all of us theyve refused to focus. While Im loathe to make a Pavement reference (lo-fi recordings! Slackers with guitars!!1!), Wild Mountain Nation comes closer to catching the carefree fuck-off sprawl of Wowee Zowee than any record in recent memory. Here the band sail through any number of genres and styles without giving off a whiff of effort, their apparent West coast breeziness covering for the judicious amount of detail crammed into nearly every song. Opener \"Devils a Go-Go\" undermines its windmilling guitars with stuttering, unpredictable rhythm; those same hiccups slide inauspiciously into the unrepentant country/southern-rock of the title track. Singer Eric Earley double-tracks himself with as much personality as his reedy voice can muster, but theres a ringer somewhere in the Blitzen Trappers pack of guitarists-- some Guitar Center regional manager bending notes with optimal precision, lifting these songs to more authentic peaks. Elsewhere, the prim and proper indie pop of \"Futures \u0026 Folly\" collides with the snarling glam rave-up of \"Miss Spiritual Tramp\" (which features a brief harmonica and, swear to god, a jaw-harp hoedown). The canny snake-charmer guitar line of \"Sci-Fi Kid\" fits easily on any satellite radio playlist, yet here its next to the gleefully raucous carnival stomp of \"Woof \u0026 Warp of the Quiet Giants Hem\". All of them demand equal attention on a dizzyingly sequenced album.\nCompared to their previous albums, Wild Mountain Nation has a newfound and audible confidence. Its the work of an assured band who can not only treat genre like so much fingerpaint, but brave enough to play it straight for a minute-- not as an empty exercise, but a chance to aspire. \"Summer Town\" is the records big breather, a washed-out AM country ballad on which Earley sings slowly and carefully through his most arresting lyrics while a harmonica, its tone sweet and simple, cements the songs yearning. Closing tracks \"Country Caravan\" and the western slowpoke \"Badgers Black Brigade\" are chummy and unpretentious sing-alongs, and while the former comes a little too close to the Eagles for comfort, its only because of its fantastically broad but contagious melody. The home run, though, is the title track, conjuring up easy freedom-rock images and Last Waltz montages, but forget nostalgia and influence for just a moment: The whole song swings, the guitars bend as proudly and woozily as teenagers with stolen six-packs, and on every clear enunciation and careful slur, you can hear Earleys grin.\nBut as diverse as it is, and as joyous as it is, Wild Mountain Nation just has songs worth coming back to. Its the title tracks early vocal hook that begs you to replay it before anything else, and then maybe the fact that its so crammed with slide guitars that the edges glisten. The gentle, almost uptight pop (comparatively) of \"Futures \u0026 Folly\" bely its resilient melody, as its the nugget that holds up best after repeated listens. I could list more highlights-- like, the downtuned dark horse \"Hot Tip/Tough Cub\", or playful glam tribute \"Murder Babe\", or or or-- but if youre down with the diversity and can sit still while the band tears through every idea it has left, Wild Mountain Nation is a revelation from beginning to end.",

        "article_text": "This Brighton trios third long-player, a singles-compilation-plus, is big fun to overthink. The witty lyrics toss biomatter into the same heap of vague \"things\" as technomatter; thus you get songs called \"Photocopier\" and \"Cassettesingle\" snugly beside songs called \"Collarbone\" and \"Ankle Injuries\". Obsessing about F\u0026Ms obsession with thingness forces one to conclude that this album is a mysterious relic from an alternate 1971.\nThink about it: In 1971, British writer Alan Watts released Does It Matter?: Essays on Mans Relation to Materiality, in which he argued (among other \"things\") that humans arent really true materialists, with our reverence for materials, resources and craft. Rather, he typed, were abstractists, caught in our preference for stockpiling plastic gewgaws. Transparent Things playfully spoofs and luxuriates in how were possessed by our possessions. One songs speaker wants to \"kick it\" with a girl, but first hes \"got to get a new pair of shoes.\" Anothers chorus taunts, \"Im just monkeying around with your furniture,\" after the verse cites spilled \"bodily fluids\" and how the subject \"must be off [his/her] bleeding rocker.\" In context, \"bleeding\" suggests actual blood rather than the UK default pejorative. With comic detachment, the lyrics casual violence contrasts with the musics antiseptic cleanness enough to make one recall the sterile/obscene, bodylike/inorganic sculptures from the milkbar and the murder victims house in Kubricks A Clockwork Orange (ahem, 1971).\nAnyway: Alan Watts went on to become a Nipponophile, leading temple tours in Japan and even getting accused of faking his enlightenment; Fujiya \u0026 Miyagi readily admit their impostorship in a chorus on this album, as if the whole thing was a meticulous piss-take: \"We were just pretending to be Japanese.\" True: Fujiyas a turntable company, and Miyagis the filmic Okinawan played by Pat Morita who instructs sullen white kids in martial arts. Fujiya \u0026 Miyagi presumably relish urban Japans cultural gizmosis, the fixation with gadgetry and the attention to detail paid even on the level of toy eraser design. F\u0026Ms carefully constructed retro-futuristic electronica definitely suggests the quaint, boxy dawn of portable media. And what year did Sony begin selling televisions in Britain, prompting the Time Magazine cover story \"Japan, Inc\"? That would be 1971.\nThe \"coincidence\" continues: Can and Neu! are the acts whose production and syncopation F\u0026M most acefully cop; both acts were either recording or releasing their crucial work in 71. \"In One Ear and Out the Other\" bounces with Eno-era Roxy Musics eerie psychedelic-lounge sound; yup, they formed and recorded their debut in 71. \"Sucking Punch\" apes the falsetto vox, pimpy guitar, and whomping, slinky bass of both Curtis Mayfields 1971-recorded Superfly and Serge Gainsbourgs 1971 LP Historie de Melody Nelson. And the name of the lengthy instrumental that best synthesizes (the 1971-recorded) Kraftwerk 2 with the best of the rest of krautrocks stoner-jazz and metronome-prog? \"Conductor 71\".\nTo be fair, Can and Neu! arent the only three-letter outfits that F\u0026M echo: This band has processed bits of contemporaries such as Air, DFA/LCD, and BoC. At points, the funk and the unrhyming lyrics even mount to imply various UK greats: A muted Happy Mondays here, a stream-of-consciousness Streets there. And yet, F\u0026Ms coy pose comes off as somehow original. David Best doesnt speak-sing about commodities with the abandon of say, Sisqo harmonizing \"thong-th-thong-thong-thong,\" but he also sidesteps the posthuman staidness with which Ladytron tried to address blue jeans and cracked plastic (during \"Blue Jeans\" and \"Cracked Plastic\", respectively) back on Light \u0026 Magic.\nA kind of consumer-Zen can be heard in the way Best sings the fabulously confident title tracks refrain, \"I look through transparent things and I feel okay,\" pronouncing the last word, \"O-kehh.\" Is he talking about seeing through eyeglasses? Drink glasses? Or, by noting the behavioral norms (of litterbugs, cyclists, and college students) and their \"grids,\" \"zones,\" and \"boxes,\" is Best referring to the matrixy systems in which most of us are transparently ensnared? Either way, F\u0026Ms execution of old modes is authoritative enough to ward off soundalike syndrome, just as Interpol somehow dodge their ancestors arrows.\nThe albums weaker spots are its louder numbers about actual monogamous desire, which seem banal next to the whispered, anchorless prosaic observations of the songs that would only count as \"rave-ups\" at some secret librarian party held on a monasterys roof. A group so adept at merely creating an irresistible pulse seems overextended when trying to concoct a banger. I mean, come on, they begin this album with shy in-house brand enthusiasm, chanting \"Fujiya\" and \"Miyagi\" in barely audible voices!\nThe relatively effete and Euro-centric American poet Wallace Stevens is famously supposed to have said to the relatively dudeish and homelandy American poet Robert Frost, upon meeting: \"The trouble with you is you write about things.\" To which Frost replied: \"The trouble with you is you write about bric-a-brac.\" Via fiery slightness, Fujiya \u0026 Miyagi humbly request that you dance to both.",

        "article_text": "Pitchfork: You opened for Wilco recently. How was that?\nGreg Saunier: When I was in the audience, watching their show, they would start a song, and people next to me would start hugging each other because they loved that song. And I thought that was something that I would really aspire to. To do something where music becomes-- and this sounds ridiculous or pretentious or something-- but where music becomes more than just good music.* * *\nAny band taking cues from Wilco-- let alone the best band in the world-- thats hard to stomach. Says Dominique Leone, \"You dont always have to sound poignant to make poignant music.\" But I appreciate Deerhoofs challenge here: to comb hair without cutting it, to wash face without popping all the pimples, to be the best band in the world, but beyond that, to be the most lovable, too.\nSo tomorrow, Deerhoof put on their Tuesday best and release their first straight-up guitar-rock album-- short, dense songs packed into familiar forms, full-bodied vocals for unabashed, often gut-punching melodies, less herk-jerk, less of that house-of-cards spirit that coursed through Reveille and Apple O. Some people will miss that.\nMilk Man, Pt. 2? Not really. Deerhoof arent holding back here so much as redistributing their energies; where before we found cute in the grotesque, now the opposite. My offer: Ill concede that Milk Man was poppy, watered down, desperate love shit if youll actually listen close to The Runners Four and realize that its onto something else entirely-- by turns jubilant, confused, afraid, angry, sad, relieved, all pretty poignant, yes. Theyve made us a hugging record. Nothing ridiculous or pretentious about hugging.\nAlmost twice the length of their other LPs, The Runners Four plays not as one big song, but as three swoops of six or seven. That first swoop (from \"Chatterboxes\" to \"Odyssey\") might dishearten the diehard, at least initially. Drummer Saunier, famed for his freakish battery, barely touches the set, but in his absence we get compositional tension, which is sometimes more intense than Sauniers top-down. Dueling guitar lines bristle close in the rub (\"Chatterboxes\"), and harmonics stab away at Chris Cohens existential pirate ballad \"Odyssey\": \"Pirates on an odyssey/ We ask the captain What will be?\" Now pirates count for some of the biggest douchebags this world has ever seen, but they get scared, too-- people forget that.\n\"Wrong Time Capsule\" starts swoop #2 with Runners most on-the-sleeves guitar riff, a cry to echo singer Satomis dejected message in a bottle: \"Dont forget me yesterday/ Cause todays no place to stay.\" The trill stays fever-high with unison chants on guitars and vox (\"Scream Team\"), folksy-bluesy confessions/comeuppance on \"After Me the Deluge\" (\"Middle love I did do you harm whenever I want to\"), up to \"Siriustar\", Deerhoofs sparse-to-gigantic guitar anthem, like nothing theyve written before. I think its about a werewolf.\nThe next third dips into more emotionally resonant stuff-- the furthest capitulation of Deerhoofs animalism so far, where lyrically they can guess the emotions of all things living (people being chased by spies) or non-living (lightning rods). We can wonder, as they do, if lemons are sad when we eat them, stuff like that, though Deerhoof make sure to push things inside-out, rescuing something human from the rumination. Runners gut-puncher, the third swoop rounds out with \"Youre Our Two\" as needly guitar lines sandwich Satomis image-heavy paranoia: \"Cast afloat on icy water/ Can I really leave?\" then \"Ark sailing/ Believe all fools or die.\"\nA somber if slightly perplexing note to end on, its the right one for this album. But Deerhoof dont leave us there. Instead they give us \"RRRRRRight\", a chirpy, stark, primitive cut á la \"Come See the Duck\". Of course, after an album so unafraid to ask for our love, Satomis ga-gas and oompah-oompahs feel somewhat inconsequential. Then I saw Deerhoof play the song live and understood why they have it here: The song is ginger, a palette cleanser as much for us as for them. Love what happened, they ask, forget what happened, start all over again.\n ",

        "article_text": "Expectations are a bitch. Ask J.D. Salinger. Or George Lucas. Or Kevin Shields. After Broken Social Scene stumbled out of the incestuous Toronto alt-rock scene with Feel Good Lost-- a postrumental refrigerator-hum stiff of a debut-- few would have guessed this group of scruffed-up bohos had a veritable classic lurking in their collective consciousness. Then, ignited by a rabid internet reception, You Forgot It in People gracefully went boom, and lots of people remembered why they loved indie rock-- the shambling ecstasy, the pitch-perfect experimentation, the unabashed heart-on-sleeveness of it all.\nNow, with file-sharers queuing up like mad and pre-orders bumping them to Amazon Top 50 status, the collective reacts to the furor by expanding and magnifying; another six members join the brood for its self-titled third full-length, and the bands once-refined studio sound is blown up into a pixilated blur of blood-gush guitars and squall-of-sound production thats somehow meticulously unhinged. This exercise in excess makes the ambitious You Forgot It in People seem positively understated by comparison.\nDe facto band leader Kevin Drew recently told Pitchfork that Broken Social Scene producer (and NYPD punching bag) David Newfeld \"got addicted to the idea of trying to top YFIIP.\" He added: \"His massage therapist says he might die in 10 years unless he changes his lifestyle.\" Its Newfelds risky mixing and uncanny knack for coalescing myriad instruments and voices into a propulsive whole that defines this new album. Whereas You Forgot It in People was exacting and refined-- each cymbal crash snipped to perfection, each underlying string melody was spare and to-the-point-- Broken Social Scene is wily and flowing. Just consider each discs mood-setting introduction: YFIIPs \"Capture the Flag\" is muted and tasteful; BSSs \"Our Faces Split the Coast in Half\" gets out of bed, trips, falls down, does a sloppy summersault, and gets back up no worse for the wear. The contrasting titles alone-- one direct, one Dali-esque-- speak volumes. But, however symbolic, \"Faces\" is only a casual stretch, with follower \"Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Half)\" serving as the albums first true workout.\n\"Ibi\" breaks in with a woozy, five-alarm guitar-- a warning call for the tracks off-key surrealism and pile-on distortion. Like the shaky ascent of a homemade rocketship, the song constantly teeters on cataclysmic oblivion; shards of chords slip away and grind against each other as the track embarks. Buried between the static and the void, mumbled vocals are folded in before the brass enters and elevates the endeavor to fist-pumping, room-on-fire glory.\nThat tracks garbled vocals and lyrical ambiguity are filtered throughout this record. With no accompanying lyric sheet, most of the albums highly interpretable words not only provide fans with a time-wasting message-board guessing game but add another layer of atmospheric haze to the groups already out-there takes on sex, politics, and that whole indies-vs.-majors thing. On the wispy, faux-idyllic \"Major Label Debut\", the chorus could be \"Im all hooked up\" or \"Im all fucked up,\" but either meaning snidely puts down the rockstar clichés Broken Social Scene are determined to avoid.\nAnyones whos been to a Broken Social Scene show over the past few years probably knows \"Major Label Debut\" as a rollicking, open hi-hat dust storm. But here, that version is relegated to an accompanying EP (otherwise filled with mostly expendable outtakes and instrumentals) while the album version is slowed down and fogged up-- and decidedly less single-worthy. Another live favorite and possible crossover contender, \"Superconnected\", is still catchy on record, but Newfelds all-at-once, in-between-vox production subverts any chance at overt smashdom.\nSuch insular stubbornness leads to Broken Social Scenes few overly self-indulgent moments, when their lack of inhibitions turns from charming to faintly annoying. Their tendency to jam out-- not entirely surprising given bassist Brendan Cannings striking Trey Anastasio-meets-Elmo look-- turn the seven-minute \"Bandwitch\" into an aimless jumble. Along with the similarly too-free-spirited \"Windsurfing Nation\" and \"Handjobs for the Holidays\", such unchecked exorbitance damages the albums hard-won continuity.\nBut a few regrettable overreachings are somewhat inevitable when a band tries to top a record as strong as YFIIP. Looser and slightly kinkier, Broken Social Scene indulges in the pop eccentricities and keen melodic ears of more than a dozen Canadians who take willful pride in their ability to lock together into one solid unit and make good on the sum of their unique individual talents. With its doomsday provocation of a title, the epic Springsteenian endcap \"Its All Gonna Break\" bursts forth with enough ideas to keep a lesser band productive for years. The song ecstatically encapsulates Broken Social Scenes heightened ambitions and flawed Icarus journeys, conflating into a bold, brash love-in infatuated with its own bumps and bruises.\n ",

        "article_text": "In 2010, the announcement that Brian Eno had signed to Warp Records was an event. His decades-long history of groundbreaking electronic music had a lot to do with Warp even existing at all, so the fact he was going to be working with the imprint known for taking the torch in the 1990s and 2000s brought dreams of great things. Lost in the excitement was the memory that Eno had for a number of years been making low-key records that made little impact outside of his cult. Another Day on Earth from 2005, his first song-based solo album in many years, had some memorable songs, and his 2008 pairing with David Byrne, Everything Happens Today, found an audience. But ’90s and ’00s instrumental releases like Drawn From Life, The Drop, Neroli, and The Shutov Assembly didn’t come close to entering his canon. The Warp signing obscured the fact that Eno always had more than his share of uneven records, in part because he’s never been the sort of artist interested in perfection. So the fact that four of the records and collaborations released on Warp have ranged from a lovely retread of familiar ground (2012’s Lux) to eminently forgettable collaborations (the two records with poet Rick Holland, and the first with Underworld’s Karl Hyde) should surprise nobody.\nHigh Life, though, is a genuine surprise. As the second meeting between Eno and Hyde in the last four months, it would have been reasonable to expect outtakes, another set of OK half-songs to accompany the ones released earlier this year. But High Life—recorded in just five days, with much of it played and processed live—is something else altogether. This is Eno’s best vocal album in 25 years, since his 1990 collaboration with John Cale, Wrong Way Up. It’s interesting to go back that far because High Life has a few things in common with that record, most prominently the elements inspired by pop music from the African continent. Yes, this is a recurring obsession of Eno’s, dating back at least to his first co-billed collaboration with David Byrne, 1981’s My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. But on High Life it’s again made explicit, from the title (Highlife is a broad genre of jazz-inflected West African pop music that emerged late in the last century) on down.\nThat said, many of the references are less musical and more textural, and guitars are the first thing you notice. The opening “Return” is nine minutes of drone-guitar bliss, as Karl Hyde strums two chords furiously with the sort of pinched, trebly, delay-heavy tone that evokes both West African styles and the Edge circa The Unforgettable Fire. The tension of pivoting between those two chords without resolution is softened by Eno’s voice, which he layers into sturdy central melody softened by billowing harmonies. It’s the kind of blindingly simple thing that nobody does better than Eno, and it points to why this record towers over much of his recent output—it sounds analog, like people in a room playing who could make mistakes. Despite his technological pedigree, Eno has always been most inspired by the place where abstract mathematics meet the messiness of nature. His earlier collaborative efforts on Warp, as well as Small Craft on a Milk Sea, felt like records where meaning was carved from endless possibility; High Life shows how much more he can wring out of just a handful of ideas.\nIf I’m leaning heavily toward Eno’s contributions here, it’s because so many of his songwriting and production signatures are in the foreground. Hyde is the guitarist throughout the record, but Eno’s fingerprints are all over his approach. “DBF” is a relatively upbeat track with a chicken scratch-funk feel that makes me think of Talking Heads’ “Born Under Punches”, while the slow and dreamy line in “Time to Waste It” brings to mind an ’80s interpretation of King Sunny Ade. But we’re talking about something more than just a collection of global music signifiers here—influences are stripped down, transformed, and often turned into something disorienting and strange through Eno’s processing. “Time to Waste It” has pinched, warped, and ultimately very weird vocals of uncertain origin which seem to be singing lead from different songs with each new line. “Lilac”’s overlapping guitar lines have the frenetic pulse of classical minimalism, with odd bleeps and squawks mixing in with the chords, and they’re contrasted with the richly harmonized vocals, which remind us how in tune he is with the pure joy of singing.\nThat big-hearted spirit is embedded into the record as a whole. I count one dud among the six tracks, the just-OK “Moulded Life”, which has some nice sounds but feels a bit like processing-for-processing’s-sake. But that is more than redeemed by the elegiac closer “Cells \u0026 Bells”, where grinding Fennesz-like electronics are set against a mass of voices singing a dark but faintly hopeful prayer. It’s a moving end to a startling and inspiring record. Eno’s been involved with quite a few of those in the past, but it’s especially nice to experience a new one that reaches us in the present moment.",

        "article_text": "Alegranza! does two things that often appear separately in records you fall in love with, but rarely together: On the one hand, it reminds you of so much other music you love, and on the other, it sounds little like any of them. Spanish artist El Guincho (real name: Pablo Díaz-Reixa) makes music from Spanish chanting, thudding tribal rhythms, ghostly harmonies, and the bits and pieces of a thousand as-yet-unwritten pop songs. Its a combination that wont be appearing in any pop how-to guides any time soon. The impressive and probably unwittingly fashionable source material-- Afrobeat, dub, Tropicália, and early rocknroll-- and the irresistibility of these songs can only briefly obscure the fact that no one else is really making music quite like this.\nAlegranza! has already been compared extensively to Panda Bears Person Pitch, and the two records do share a hazy, sampladelic love-in feel (hypnotic, interlocking sample loops; delirious, auto-harmonizing pop song choruses). Im more strongly reminded of Animal Collectives Strawberry Jam, even though this record sounds very different: Both it and Alegranza! are spikier, less pristine, and less invested in images of the past. Theres no sacred totem in Alegranza! to play the role that the Beach Boys do for Person Pitch-- opener \"Palmitos Park\" may sound a bit like Richie Valens, but otherwise El Guinchos songcraft resemblances are at once so broad and so diffuse that they feel osmotic rather than deliberate: Confused chants coalesce into brain-teasingly familiar vocal hooks, while quicksilver flashes of guitar trace echoes of melodies you feel you must already know like the back of your hand.\nWhile the \"What if...?\" experiments of Person Pitch suggested a future and a past in secret communication with each other, Alegranza! is locked into an endless now: a fusion of songful simplicity and unpolished production wizardry that feels right more than it feels startling. Its nice, too, that this music resists the easy tag of \"dreamlike\"; theres a sharpness to the detail and to the buoyancy of Díaz-Reixas vocals and rhythms that suggests a state of gleeful alertness. This is music for children, in the best sense-- wide-eyed and excitedly open to the whole spectrum of possibilities out there in the world, devoid of past baggage or future anxiety. (In fact, its not at all coincidental that one of the best reference points I can offer for this album is British post-rock band Disco Infernos final EP, Its a Kids World.\nTheres something childlike, too, in the way El Guinchos chants and harmonies seem to shift between (relative) tension and release with delighted and purposeless ease, shuttling between the registers of high and higher for the simple thrill of confounding expectations, as if reaching a peak and staying there would be a cop-out. The madly hopping \"Kalise\", at first ridiculously and hypnotically repetitive, is ultimately exposed as a giant tease for an astonishing, panoramic chorus, whose multi-tracked \"ah ah ah!\" might be the most utopian moment in music youll hear this year. Theres little subtlety here: \"Fata Morgana\" may begin with ambient washes of sound, disconcerting looped string riffs, and abstracted wails in the background, but again its a trap: the song soon morphs into a triumphant anthem, zooming across the stereo mix as if on a trapeze.\nMost of all, its Díaz-Reixas intuitive feel for rhythm that marks out Alegranza! as such an unusual and enticing listening experience. Deceptively simple and surprisingly prominent in the mix, his drum patterns shock not just by their variety (how do you get from the charged booty grind of \"Cuando Maravilla Fui\" to the spacious underwater kraut-dub of \"Buenos Matrimonios Ahí Afuera\"?) but also by their suspicious habit of mutating almost imperceptibly from comforting to impressively alien: Check the way \"Costa Paraíso\"s clattering tribal rhythms fold themselves into ever tighter coils of frenzy, like a crowd of dancers about to spontaneously combust. Rather than stretch out on endless expanses of sound, El Guinchos music is all about sharp and sudden peaks and valleys-- the idea isnt to tune in and drop out, but to revel in being surrounded by something larger than yourself, swept along on the rapids of rhythm.",

        "article_text": "Bradford Cox spent the summer he was 16 in a childrens hospital having multiple surgeries on his chest and back. His condition, Marfan syndrome, has proven difficult to separate from his music. Coxs lost summer hangs over his songs, and his gawky physique has been the dress-draped centerpiece of his bands confrontational live shows. At the same time, he can also be defensive about his appearance, using it to explain why his musics detractors are sometimes as hyperbolic as his most fervent admirers. Thousands of words later, other music critics still ask me what I could possibly like in Coxs work.\nCox plays and sings in Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter, but its tempting to say he actually lives as Atlas Sound. Hes used the name for his solo recordings ever since the sixth grade, and lately his output has been almost nonstop: Hes posted roughly 70 new tracks, mostly originals, on his blog since last July. Deerhunters Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey EP expertly brought together elements of krautrock, psych, shoegaze, ambient, post-punk, and indie rock, but Atlas Sounds full-length debut turns inward from that bands high-volume squall. Cox also trades the four-track of previous Atlas Sound vinyl splits for a laptop. The result is a gauzy bedroom pop album that drifts from ambient bliss-outs to sadsack avant-garage, from hospitals to heartache, as if passing through different stages of sleep on a sunny afternoon. No previous interest in Deerhunter required.\nCox spent the summer he was 25 touring and recording Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel. But the fears of nine years earlier stalk the albums corridors. Opener \"A Ghost Story\" sets a hissy sample of a young boy clumsily narrating over the fluorescent hum of treated, sampled glockenspiel. Childhood innocence gives way to to adolescent confusion on the waltz-like \"Recent Bedroom\", as a music box crashes headlong into squiggly guitars and bustling percussion. A Zimbabwean instrument called a mbira and some bells from Ghana waft through guitars and collaged drums on \"Quarantined\", a song that evokes both childrens hospitals and a sense of unresolved metamorphosis: \"I am waiting to be changed.\"\nBy the time of his summer in the hospital, Cox had already met Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, to whom he dedicated this album. A sample of Pundts slender, bouncing guitar lick forms the basis of seventh cut \"Cold as Ice\", the way a Flamingos or Lionel Richie snippet might become a track by the Field, although Cox adds his own frail tenor and jangling tambourine along with a driving beat. The first half of the album watches the world from afar, but from here on, Coxs narrator directly addresses an unattainable love interest.\nThe difference between the albums halves is clear from just its catchiest few songs. On what would be side A, the clipped drum rolls and treated harps of \"River Card\" cant make the object of Coxs doomed whispers (\"River so clear and blue/ Im so in love with you/ But youll drown me\") any easier to hold, just as the narrator cant cry on \"Recent Bedroom\", see his friends on \"Quarantined\", or make friends at all on \"On Guard\". Near the end of the album, though, the guitar-driven, spring reverb-drenched \"Ativan\" goes into bitterly specific detail about sleeping in while a person has \"lunch with a girl/ who takes time to listen to every single word you utter.\" Two tracks earlier, \"Bite Marks\" describes self-inflicted scars-- not surgical ones-- as two guitar notes drone and buzz. Weezers \"Only in Dreams\" probably isnt the comparison Cox would pick for his achingly nostalgic bass line, but then again, the title fits.\nLet the Blinds beauty is in the way the music renders Coxs plaintive themes, not in the impressionistic language he chooses to express them. The closing, instrumental title track returns to the glockenspiels from opener \"A Ghost Story\", joined by organ and mbira for a flickering, look-ma-no-drums ambient piece recalling the \"pop ambient\" of Kompakts Gas and Markus Guentner or the psychedelic electronic space-outs of the Orb; wordless \"Ready, Set, Glow\" achieves something similar with nylon-string strums, shakers, glockenspiel, and Coxs own sampled vocals. Later, \"After Class\" reshapes Deerhunters contribution to the recent Living Bridge compilation into another lyric-less track that builds up nicely to \"Ativan\", like a skilled DJ keeping the room on edge before a climactic break. Out of context, its the least essential thing here, but it seems significant that the originals coda (\"Strip down, strip down\") implies a release this albums lovelorn central figure never finds.\nWhen there are words, theyre often simple and repetitive, or else overshadowed by the lush sonics. The chiming prettiness and misty vocals of Kraftwerk via Ralf \u0026 Florians \"Tanzmusik\" help set the template for more than a couple of tracks on Let the Blind, including the terse, jittery \"On Guard\". Brooklyn-via-Detroit techno-pop savant Matthew Dear would probably give up one of his pseudonyms for the way \"Winter Vacation\" merges glistening, euphoric pop with a minimal techno beat. Music boxes no longer sound so innocent on the clanging, alarm-like \"Scraping Past\", the track that will interrupt your reverie.\nThen again, the last thing youll notice about \"Small Horror\" is the lyrics, but theyre naked, a little naïve, and utterly human. Nothing but droning, treated guitar and Coxs crying, defeated voice, the track is a desperate plea that finds a certain hymn-like exaltation in its own sadness. \"Hold me even though you couldnt care less,\" Cox murmurs slowly.\n\"I woke up,\" Cox sings on both Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey. Atlas Sounds debut ends with the protagonist going back to sleep, the dreamer dreaming. As with each of Coxs projects, Let the Blind works best as a swirling, disorienting whole, organizing traditionally abstract styles like graphic-design elements within his unifying vision until they communicate like good pop. If Cryptograms was a puzzle, Coxs latest is a cocoon. Strange as it may seem to admit, how much time you choose to spend in it could depend on how you react to Coxs persona. Those drawn to his lovesick, evolving audio presence have, like Morrissey or Belle \u0026 Sebastian obsessives, an entire world to explore. Hell, none of these 14 tracks are even on the blog.",

        "article_text": "Matthew Herbert is a classic British eccentric in a dance scene that valorizes sleek and vacuous cool. In another time you could imagine him walking a crustacean on a leash in a purple velour smoking jacket. You could not, however, imagine him alongside Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos on a beach in Ibiza. Whether its a minimal jock in Cologne or a superclub jock in Queens, Herberts records dont make it into many DJ boxes. And he creates albums you can listen to all the way through in a genre built on singles-- hes been responsible for some of the warmest, most inviting and inventive \"dance\" music of all time.\nHerberts has often built his work around three constants: musique concréte, politics, and the female voice. The influence of musique concréte-- building music from everyday sounds-- has been most audible when hes worn his avant hats, Radio Boy and Wishmountain, but has continued throughout his career. Live and on disc, hell turn the sound of crumpled styrofoam or whirring blenders into slinky or stomping house grooves. The politics are relatively new. Early Herbert records were lush and luscious and lithe, but not exactly demigogical. Over the past few years, however, Herberts anti-consumerist and anti-imperialist views have crept into his lyrics and sonics-- that crumpled styrofoam suddenly found itself as part of a greater statement about the fast food nation. And then theres also his Personal Contract for the Composition of Music, which deals with another kind of politics-- the politics of sampling.\nHerbert believes its pointless to sample a trumpet melody or a hi-hat when you can pick up horn or drumstick. Why not instead build rhythm and melody out of tapping pencils or scratched denim? Like the microhouse he had a hand in ushering into existence, Herbert tracks have a unique timbral and textural pallette-- crunchy, squishy, squelchy, crackly, snappy. No presets here. It can get exhausting on a theoretical level-- its only so interesting that a drum kit was crafted out of sampled dinner conversation or the sound of copulating egrets, after all-- but youll certainly never hear a Herbert tune built around the familiar sound of an 808.\nThe female voice is the part of the equation that gets the least press. But its actually his greatest strength. Herberts first superb work, 1998s Around the House, was elevated above deep house-meets-IDM by the jazzy burr of his partner and long-time collaborator, Dani Siciliano. His masterpiece-to-date-- Ruby Blue, a 2005 collaboration with Róisín Murphy-- is so great because hes tackling songs, not grooves. (Though they certainly groove.) Herbert builds his beats around the singer, rather than salt and pepper them with a sampled voice. It transformed him from a leftfield dance artist into a pop producer with a sound artists instincts.\nAll three constants are in evidence on Scale, another wobbly step down his idiosyncratic path of torch songs, high-end sampledelia, and disco motion. The album draws more from disco than house, from glam than techno, and from blue-eyed soul than trip-hop-- theres a bounce and a skip here that suggests roller-skating rather than chin-stroking. Much of Scale has a sumptuous jazz feel, but unlike Herberts slightly stodgy and overly retro big band album from 2002, the music remembers that big band jazz moved the hips. And then there are the strings.\nRecorded live at Abbey Road Studios, the strings on Scale are the most sumptuous musical elements to ever appear on a Herbert record. Wags have already said theyre more Lawrence Welk than Nelson Riddle. True, there is something corny about them, but the corniness works: Disco was full of records that equated opulence and upward mobility with the in-house orchestras of 1940s Hollywood. In the race to link disco to house and techno and beyond, people forget that there was always a brassy, Broadway vibe to the best disco. After all, it was a short walk downtown from Guys and Dolls to Kid Creole and the Coconuts.\nLyrically, the political knives come out within the first few lines of the first song, \"Something Isnt Right\": \"I just dont know how to bring about your downfall/ Damn fool/ Go figure out/ How those Christian bones/ Can orchestrate/ Shock and awe.\" Theyre easy to overlook-- as they are throughout the record-- because the singing is so creamy, the vocal arrangements so rich. But once you hear them, like a Magic Eye painting, its difficult to un-hear references to \"holy wars\" and U.S. imperialism. They dont always sit quite right with the love songs-- and like his stringent sampling rules, its easy to poke fun at Herberts political earnestness. But as someone with a political conscience who makes music, what else can he do?\nVocally, Scale is a constant delight. Sicilianos voice, once lurking in the hallways of Herberts house productions, is now center stage. Herbert takes the tricks he learned on Ruby Blue in layering and harmonizing voices and revels in them. Siciliano is one of the great house singers, belting with glee on \"Moving Like a Train\", only to then yearn post-coitally on \"Were in Love\", drawing out the title like the worlds most relaxed orgasm. And dig the way she lasciviously opens \"Movie Star\" with \"you wanna, you wanna put it in my\" as Herbert playfully bleeps out exactly where you wanna put it. The man himself takes a creaky turn at the mic at the albums end, cracking like a lounge singer after one too many brandies.\nScale lacks the unified feel of Ruby Blue, but makes up for it by overreaching itself. From the number of samples (more than 720) to the methods of recording (under water! in a hot air baloon! in a moving car!), Herbert has outdone himself when it comes to his usual conceptual three-ring circus. But, crucially, this time hes put all that theoretical effort into his most memorable songs. Sophisticated and whimsical, joyful and yet tinged with sadness, Scale is one of this years great albums.",

        "article_text": "\"Borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80s.\" Those words, when James Murphy over-enunciated them on whats still arguably the decades best piece of music-as-music-criticism-- LCD Soundsystems 2002 debut single, \"Losing My Edge\"-- had the decisive feel of a gauntlet being thrown down. One 1980s baby struck back with a Nintendo Power Glove. Just a guess: Probably not what Murphy had in mind.\nOf course, cheaply copied reminiscences of a blurrily imagined decade are basically their own genre now, cloudy and proud. The sound has many names, but none of them seem to fit just right. Dream-beat, chillwave, glo-fi, hypnagogic pop, even hipster-gogic pop-- all are imperfect phrases for describing a psychedelic music thats generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus. Washed Out. Memory Tapes. Ducktails. Ah-woo-ooh.\nFor Alan Palomo, reflecting on the music of the Reagan era has a personal component. The Texas-reared Mexico natives dad, Jorge, was a bit of a Spanish-language pop star in the late 1970s and early 80s. The analog electronics of that bygone period echo throughout the younger Palomos increasingly promising previous recordings, whether with former band Ghosthustler (he wore the Power Glove in the video for their \"Parking Lot Nights\") or, more recently, on VEGAs Well Known Pleasures EP. Finally, working with Brooklyn-based visual collaborator Alicia Scardetta as Neon Indian, Palomo has brought all the best of 2009s summer sounds-- bedroom production, borrowed nostalgia, unresolved sadness, deceptively agile popcraft-- together on a single album.\nWhatever they owe to the past, the memories on Psychic Chasms are Palomos and ours. Soft vocals recalling You Made Me Realise-era Kevin Shields. Italo-disco synth arpeggios. Hall \u0026 Oates drum sounds. Divebombing video-game effects. Brittle guitar distortion. Manipulated tapes that bend the notes the way Shields \"glide guitar\" did, the way bluesmens fret fingers did. Field recordings of birds. Oohing and ahhing backing vocals. And samples, on at least two songs, of the elder Palomo, whose electro-rock approach was quite similar. All combine on eight or nine unforgettable songs and a few tantalizingly brief interludes, indelibly capturing the glamor and bleary malaise of being young and horny as an empire devours itself.\nLike a low-rent Daft Punk, Palomo takes what 1990s rock fans probably wouldve considered cheesy-- LinnDrum and Oberheim rhythms, Chromeo-plated electro-funk Korg riffs, processed party-vocal samples-- and not only makes them part of a distinct artistic vision, but also keeps them fun. Quick opener \"(AM)\" is rife with detail, as an indecipherable tenor floats over a mock-dramatic drum fill and 8-bit star cruisers do battle against twinkling fairy dust. Another sub-minute interstitial track, \"(If I Knew, Id Tell You)\", keeps its secrets to itself, letting multiple melodic synth lines hint at a gulf-sized pool of melancholy over a tape-altered rhythm track. \"Laughing Gas\", at slightly more than a lyric-less minute and a half, is the one that ruins my attempted distinction between songs and interludes, with bongo drums, robot vocal samples, and euphoric giggles straight out of those Air France kids dreams. The cumulative result is a meltdown-deadened but deliriously inventive perspective on pop.\n\"I really hope the medium by which someone writes a song isnt the only thing the song has going for it,\" Palomo told our own Ryan Dombal in a recent interview. With Psychic Chasms, Palomo doesnt need to worry. \"Deadbeat Summer\" and \"Should Have Taken Acid With You\" are two views of the same non-endless season-- one mind-expandingly lazy and the other too lazy for mind expansion, both undeniably catchy, both earning doctorates in The Graduate school of coming-of-age ennui. The Italo-alluding title track, the New Order-throbbing \"Local Joke\", and the visceral funk alarums of \"Ephemeral Artery\" are beautiful bummers, tracks with lyrics the faithful are sure to puzzle out the way kids used to with the first couple of Weezer CDs. \"Living this way held by a single strand/ But you wouldnt understand,\" worries \"6669 (I Dont Know If You Know)\", which comes back, refracted again, as 56-second finale \"7000 (Reprise)\". If you want to destroy his sweater, hold this thread as he walks away.\nOverall, Psychic Chasms is something like a dream collaboration between the Tough Alliance and Atlas Sound, the latter of whose Internet-only Weekend EP shares a delinquent theme with one of Psychic Chasms best songs. After barely a half hour, the whole thing is over, but theres enough going on in the layered electronics and enigmatic longing to make this one of the years most replayable albums. Consider \"Terminally Chill\", which has more vocal and instrumental hooks than the average Top 40 song, but also the immediately recognizable stamp of an impressive young talent. Palomos gear was stolen last month while on tour with VEGA, but a recent FADER video suggests he could launch a decently credible alternate \"career\" as an acoustic troubadour doing Mexican traditional songs. For various mundane personal reasons, this cassette-focused album is one of the actual CDs Ive listened to most since I actually listened to CDs. A new generations borrowed nostalgia? High time.",

        "article_text": "There were few voices that articulated the anxious, fractured state of America in the 1970s and early 80s as well as the clear baritone of Gil Scott-Heron. As a spoken-word artist and poet, he could pinpoint the fissures in the American dream and exorcise them with a wit that blended righteous anger and arch sarcasm. As a singer he could envelop those same uncomfortable confrontations in a rich, emotional tone that brought out the empathetic face of unrest. Yet except for a chorus cameo on Blackalicious \"First in Flight\" and a memorable shout-out on LCD Soundsystems \"Losing My Edge\", he was rarely heard or cited in the early years of Americas great post-traumatic decade, even if his pained depiction of \"a nation that just cant stand much more\" in \"Winter in America\" rang as true in 2002 as it did in 1975.\nInstead, Scott-Heron spent much of the 00s in and out of prison on drug charges, adding onto a long hiatus that saw him turn away from the record industry in favor of live performance and writing. Between 1983 and 2009, he released only one studio album, 1994s Spirits, so issuing his first in 16 years couldve been rife with potential for a pent-up analysis of everything thats happened in the process of race relations and American culture over the last couple decades. Yet Im New Here sees an incisive political voice turning inwards, not protesting the doings of the greater world but crafting a frank confessional over the state of his own. He does this allusively, through cover songs and short soundbite interludes and original compositions that feel like sparse flashes of a deep, once-dormant creative impulse. Yet it still feels honest, like something said out of necessity instead of opportunity, and the result is an album that engages with the idea of loneliness in exceptional ways.\nIm New Here is bookended with a two-part spoken-word track that sounds like a metatextual stunt: the quintessential hip-hop prototype discussing his upbringing over a loop of the intro to Kanye Wests \"Flashing Lights\", returning the nod towards \"Home Is Where the Hatred Is\" that underpinned Late Registrations \"My Way Home\". But \"On Coming From a Broken Home\" is a powerful mission of purpose that sets the tone for the rest of the album, a reflection of his upbringing that made him the man he is today. \"Broken Home\" pays homage to the women in his family and the strengths they passed on to him; other interludes hint at darkly comic acknowledgements of wrongdoing, modest but defiant statements of enduring survival, and an admission that even his less desirable personality traits are an inseparable part of his identity.\nThose brief interstitial statements link pieces of brain-wracked guilt and anxiety that rank as truly haunting moments: \"Where Did the Night Go\", a study in lonely insomnia and the inability to communicate with someone he loves, and the confession in \"New York Is Killing Me\" that the city that held him in an alienating grasp for so long-- \"eight million people, and I didnt have a single friend\"-- only makes him long for the home in Tennessee he left at 13 after his grandmother died. Its an interesting contrast to the sentiment of his 1976 song \"New York City\", where he sang of a metropolis he loved because it reminded him of himself. Either the personalities of the man and the city have diverged too much, or theyve gotten too close for comfort.\nBut the most noticeable thing about Scott-Heron on this album to anyone familiar with his work is how worn his voice sounds. Its raspier and age-weathered, less agile, and occasionally prone to letting words slur and melt into each other instead of leaping out as they did back in the 70s. But Richard Russell, the albums producer and owner of XL Recordings, hit on the idea of recasting a man who came up through soul-jazz as a grizzled blues performer, and setting Scott-Heron against sandblasted folk and heavy, borderline-industrial beats augments the rawness of his voice well. Three songs reveal him as an adept interpreter of three generations worth of roots music: Robert Johnsons \"Me and the Devil\" rendered as vintage Massive Attack, a minimalist, piano-driven orchestral reworking of the Brook Benton-written Bobby \"Blue\" Bland classic \"Ill Take Care of You\", and the unexpected but deftly claimed title track, sourced from Smog. And two spare, static-textured cuts late in the album, \"Running\" and \"The Crutch\", give his equally-gritty voice a fitting place in the post-Burial strain of bass music.\nFor an album that comes so far after its creators last trip to the studio, its a bit of a relief that the only cause for disappointment is its brief length. Im New Here is less than half an hour, though in that short span it does the impressive job of reviving an artist thats been out of the spotlight far too long and setting him up for a new incarnation as an elder statesman of modern roots music. Comparisons have been made to what Rick Rubin did for Johnny Cash in the 90s, and the parallels are there: Im New Here and American Recordings are both cover-heavy, starkly-produced releases where rebellious icons become reflective as they hit their sixties. If Gil Scott-Herons creative resurgence continues after this reintroduction to his poignantly aging voice, we could be looking at one of the most memorably resurrected careers of our time-- a man renewed.",

        "article_text": "Department of Eagles have the kind of convoluted, meandering backstory that could squash a less compelling band. Before he joined Grizzly Bear in 2004, Daniel Rossen was splicing together samples and bits of unearthed sound with his NYU roommate, Fred Nicolaus; the duos collages were released, in 2003, as Department of Eagles eerie, twittering debut, The Cold Nose. That record was followed, in 2006, by a remix album and preceded by a series of vinyl-only singles, under the name Whitey and the Moon UK (also the original title of The Cold Nose). Not long after its release, Rossen partnered with Ed Droste and Grizzly Bear and the Department of Eagles project was put on hiatus-- until late 2007, when the DOE duo, now enlisting contributions from Rossens Grizzly Bear brethren Chris Bear and Chris Taylor, began recording again. Unlike Department of Eagles earlier output, which was heavily focused on sound art and electronic pastiche, In Ear Park is a sprawling pop record (complete with guitars, piano, horns, banjo, and more) that evokes Sgt. Peppers, Sung Tongs, Van Dyke Parks, and Gene Clark. Like any good sonic experiment, In Ear Park extends with each listen, and things that once sounded small-- the piano bits on \"Teenagers\", the opening fuzz of \"No One Does It Like You\", the noirish echoing footsteps sampled in \"Classical Records\"-- become epic on the fourth or fifth spin, as the album swells and expands.In Ear Park is dedicated to Rossens late father, and while the album is hardly mournful, it is infused with a kind of omnipresent melancholy that occasionally tempers its sunshine (\"I laughed so hard I fell down,\" Rossen sings in \"No One Does It Like You\". \"I curse these legs I walked on.\") Opener and title track \"In Ear Park\" begins with high, twitchy acoustic guitar, which eventually gives way to an unsteady, paranoid haze; this is Department of Eagles at their freak-folkiest, and its impossible not to hear the mesmeric whirl of the Incredible String Band (occasionally, Rossens voice-- wispy and soft-- even sounds a bit like Robin Williamsons). Elsewhere, the band is more straightforward (reinforcing Rossens claim that some of this material was \"too personal\" for Grizzly Bear)-- the ominous \"Around the Bay\" is a nice slice of gothic-folk, with its acoustic strums, thunderstorm percussion, and sharp, threatening vocals. Unlike a lot of side projects, Department of Eagles are remarkably self-sufficient-- possibly because Rossen and Nicolaus partnership predates the current incarnation of Grizzly Bear. The breather between their earlier work and In Ear Park has paid off, helping Rossen and Nicolaus craft a rich, disorienting new direction for Department of Eagles. Ambitious and complex, its stuffed with cocooning harmonies and shimmering, sunlight-smacking-the-Pacific melodies-- a languid, easy West Coast record (think Randy Newman or SMiLE), infused with classic East Coast anxiety.",

        "article_text": "\"Im always going to feel like this person on the outside looking in,\" Robyn recently told Popjustice. The Swedish singer and songwriter has no fear of pop: A platinum seller in her own country, Robyn cracked the Billboard top 10 in the late 1990s working with famed teen-pop producer Max Martin. As the daughter of a couple who ran an independent theater company, however, Robin Miriam Carlsson is also a woman who enjoys doing things her own way.\nRobyn, first released in Scandinavia five years ago on the newly liberated singers own Konichiwa label, ultimately led to a UK #1 hit, a tour with Madonna, and Snoop Dogg remix spots. Major labels turned out to be a necessary evil, but the deals on Robyns terms now. \"Its pop music, you know?\" she told us earlier this year. \"Its entertainment and at the same time it has to mean something to me. I like dealing with that balance.\"\nWith Body Talk Pt. 1, the first of a potential three new albums tentatively scheduled for 2010, Robyn doesnt just walk the line between what she has called the \"commercial\" and \"tastemaker\" realms. She obliterates it. Immaculately produced, fantastically sung, and loaded with memorable choruses, this eight-song effort has plenty to please everyone from post-dubstep crate diggers to teen tweeters-- often at the same time. Like most of Robyns best tracks, though, from mid-90s teen-pop hit \"Show Me Love\" to \"With Every Heartbeat\" a decade later, Body Talk Pt. 1 is capable of not only appealing to many different people, but also touching them emotionally.\"Play me some kind of new sound/ Something true and sincere,\" Robyn begs on \"None of Dem\", a dark, tense, early-morning type of dance track featuring Norwegian electropop duo Röyksopp. Shes not being hypocritical. Opener \"Dont Fucking Tell Me What to Do\", a talky electro-house tirade against electro-age anxieties, really isnt like anything else in the singers discography. \"Dancehall Queen\", her so-wrong-its-right collaboration with tastemaking Philadelphia DJ/producer Diplo, may have purists grumbling at its 1980s dancehall synths, subwoofer wobble, and \"Sleng Teng\" shoutout-- the titles sideways allusion to ABBA appears to have gone generally overlooked-- but \"I came to dance, not to socialize.\" Its here, dancing, with a chorus that Santigold and Gwen Stefani might kill for, that Robyn is free from all the worries that are \"killing\" her at the albums start.\nRobyn reintroduced Robyn as a Missy Elliott-loving badass. Body Talk Pt. 1 texts that persona into the 2010s. Most similar to songs like \"Konichiwa Bitches\", \"Cobrastyle\", and \"Curriculum Vitae\" is first preview \"Fembot\", a Klas Åhlund co-write that flips the script on Robyns track for Röyksopps 2009 Junior. On \"The Girl and the Robot\", Robyn was the neglected lover \"asleep again in front of MTV.\" Here, to wonderful effect, shes a \"scientifically advanced hot mama.\"\nBut Robyn seems most comfortable watching from afar as somebody else goes home with her prize. Dancing, the narrators escape on \"Dancehall Queen\", becomes a prison of her own making on the albums emotional peak, \"Dancing on My Own\"-- a clear descendant of Robyns girl-loses-boy, boy-ties-Ms.-Whatshernames-laces classic, \"Be Mine!\". With unadorned piano and strings, \"Hang With Me (Acoustic Version)\" is closer to \"Be Mine! (Ballad Version)\" and hits similar emotional notes: You say youre just friends, well thats OK, but dont you dare \"fall recklessly, headlessly in love with\" her. If shes sitting on a killer dancefloor version of this one, good luck.\nIn an album full of songs that manage to be both specific and universal, \"Cry When You Get Older\" might prove to be the most enduring: a prom song, a graduation song, an end-of-summer-camp-PowerPoint song. Dudes like Max Martin and Peter Bjorn \u0026 John meet at parties and brag about what great melodies theyve written, Robyn told us a couple of years ago; this is one worth bragging about. The lyrics are conversational, the synths respond, and theres a Prince reference to go with a Smashing Pumpkins \"1979\"-like perspective on teenage ennui. Everybody in the back, quote it: \"I lost all my faith in science/ So I put my faith in me.\"Body Talk Pt. 1 ends painfully soon, but at least it ends with a pair of tracks focusing on Robyns soulful voice. In addition to \"Hang With Me\", theres \"Jag Vet En Dejilg Rosa\", a Swedish traditional song the singer performed over Björn Yttlings piano accompaniment in a 2007 tsunami memorial. Here shes backed by bells, and her touch is lighter. Robyns vocals arent only about singing; theyre also about untranscribeable details like the little flutter when she sort of smiles at herself on this slow song, or her goofy ad libs between lyrics on faster songs. Above all, Robyn puts herself on the line-- loses her cool for the sake of emotional connection-- like few other contemporary vocalists.In 2000, a guy I know e-mailed Robyn about singing technique. In her reply, she gave detailed advice about maintaining his jaw muscles, hips, back, tongue, and vocal chords. \"But the most important thing,\" she wrote, \"is to be happy, and I dont mean that you always should be in a good mood. Because all the emotional stress that you feel is reflected in your body and can easily affect your voice-- which is a good thing if you take care of it. Because it is a tool that will help you get to know yourself and remind you when its time for you to look inside for answers.\" Head and hips are both important, but the heart is still the strongest muscle. Bring it, Body Talk Pt. 2.",

        "article_text": "Despite their wall of noise, Trash Talk work best in miniature. The Sacramento quartet (and OFF! tourmates) wield such an in-your-personal-space presence and messy, spastic forward push that it can be hard, as a viewer or listener, to give them back the energy they deserve. When watching their shows-- during which they often repurpose bottles, mic stands, and garbage cans as projectiles-- its thrilling when they unplug, and youre still locked in and protecting your head. The groups 10-song, 17-minute 2010 third album, Eyes \u0026 Nines, was good; their new, five-song, nine-minute Awake EP is great. Not all of this has to do with leaving-you-wanting-more brevity: The band, led by playfully (but effectively) violent, wall-climbing vocalist Lee Spielman, are finding more ways to cram hooks and distinctive details into what, in the past, followed a more specific punk template. Here, the guys nail a sort of thrashing pop to the spastic hardcore without loosening the grip around your throat.\nSee, for instance, the opening title track: Starting with solo drumming and then some guitar feedback and double vocal shouts-- Spielmans spastic upper register mixed with a deeper grunt-- \"Awake\" turns into something colossal in under two minutes. The pulse is rollicking, weirdly unhurried (no vocals until 23 seconds in), the whole thing packed tight. And, as usual, the lyrics feel like a call to arms. We get the scene-setting introductory line, \"In the land of nod, he who sleeps with both eyes open is god,\" but its the chorus-- \"Reflected in conniption fits/ Im jaundiced, gaunted, sick sick sick/ Awake\"-- that establishes a more interesting tone.\nIts a kind of vintage Maximumrocknroll vibe, with sentiments you might glean from Crimethinc. From the thorny inverted peace symbol on the cover, the disenfranchised lyrical sentiment (see the the smash-shit-up \"Awake\" video), Trash Talk continue to dig into the sort of anger that inspired the recent Occupy Wall Street protests. Though it taps into feelings that have always been there, it feels especially important and of this moment. In the 58-second track \"Slander\" we get: \"Line up and call me names/ Come spit in my face/ It doesnt matter/ Im in a better place.\" In the fantastic closer \"Gimme Death\", were given a protagonist making the most of destitution: \"Facedown in the gutter/ Ive got my ear to the street.\" In the breakdown-heavy \"Blind Evolution\", were told, \"Ive got a problem with no solution/ The solutions out of reach,\" and, \"Your revolutions already lost.\" Even on this short burst of an EP, Trash Talk are working on a more expansive level.\nFor instance, the last lines of the record-- \"Gimme death\"-- resonate as more than a standard punk toss-off after a close listen to fourth track \"Burn Alive\". In two minutes of the latter, theres a Ramones nod (\"When I grow up I wanna be sedated\"), revolutionary imagery (\"Plant the seed and the fury spreads like legs/ Without a light at the end of the tunnel unless they set the whole mountain ablaze\"), and this: \"A blind man told me its better to burn out than to fade away/ I said Youre missing the point… yeah, the good die young/ But the great survive to burn alive/ The good die young, so burn alive.\" Trash Talk have been drawing that sort of line in the sand for years-- its the sort of thing lifers do. Still, in 2011 its satisfying seeing a higher-profile punk band carrying a torch like this, and unafraid to use it as a weapon.",

        "article_text": "Punk rock has had its share of ambitious bands producing ambitious records-- Double Nickels on the Dime, Zen Arcade, Sandinista!, and The Shape of Punk to Come spring to mind-- but few groups in this sphere have pushed the envelope as often as Fucked Up. For the last few years, theyve been releasing singles as part of a series based on the Chinese Zodiac, each of which usually runs over the 10-minute mark. For a 2007 charity Christmas single, they managed to get James Murphy, Nelly Furtado, and \"Degrassi: the Next Generation\"/\"90210\" actress Shenae Grimes (among many, many others) to appear on the same song; during a 12-hour (!) NYC concert in 2008, they got moshers to smash along to Vampire Weekends Ezra Koenig doing Descendents covers. Their reach continues unabated on their new album, David Comes to Life, a 78-minute rock opera.\nThe story of David Comes to Life is fairly complicated and, at points, heavily meta. It concerns a factory worker named David Eliade who falls in love with a woman named Veronica Boisson. They conspire to build a bomb together and death, destruction, and redemption follow; along the way, the storys narrator does battle with David for control of the plot. Theres a long tradition of rock concept albums that arent easy to understand, and this one is no exception; but enjoying it doesnt depend on decoding the tale. The record is divided into four separate acts, with a narrative focus that shifts from scene to scene-- a few songs are told from the overarching narrators perspective, while Davids ex-girlfriend, Vivian Benson, offers her side of the story in the albums back half. While a few guest vocalists are employed to help out-- Cults Madeline Follin and singer/songwriter Jennifer Castle represent Veronica and Vivian, respectively-- the story is largely told by the bands screaming frontman, Damien Abraham, aka Pink Eyes. Taking into account the albums relatively limited range-- almost an hour and a half of straight-up bashing and riffage, with moments like the jangly acoustic figure that opens \"A Slanted Tone\" as a rare respite-- it becomes apparent that you will need a few listens and a lyric sheet to apprehend David Comes to Lifes ambition and follow its labyrinthine storyline.\nOr, you could just sit back and let the records dense, visceral blast of guitar squall wash over you. More than any single Fucked Up record, David Comes to Life is thick with walls of noisy melody. Its hard to get a handle on just how many guitar tracks are on a given song, and Shane Stoneback deserves a medal for mixing the sheer bulk of the sound into something so clear. But for all the shoegazey textures and blistering sonic assault, David Comes to Life is also direct and immediate. Hooks are piled on top of hooks, bursting through torrents of spacey noise (\"I Was There\") and peppy rhythms (\"The Recursive Girl\") alike. At points, the primal appeal of the blunt and effective riffing even brings to mind the bar-band rock of the Hold Steady.\nOut front, Abraham still retains his scorched-earth bark. Hes been finding ways to broaden his voices impact, and its never sounded better than it does here. Abraham knows his range and limitations and is finding new ways to work within them while adjusting to the bands forward lurch, in effect becoming another instrument in the mix. His stomping melancholia on \"Turn the Season\" feels like a gut-check, while he follows up his sole quiet moment on album closer \"Lights Go Up\" by shouting amidst curled screams, \"Im still in love with you/ After all of this time!\" Besides the aforementioned appearances by Follin and Castle, Kurt Vile delivers a typically slack backing vocal on \"Lights Go Up\", too-- but, really, this is The Pink Eyes Show, and its never been so compelling to watch.\nThat said, all the howling and the albums extreme length might be a tough thing for those new to Fucked Up. For people in this category, it might be best to check out Hidden World first; its a good representation of how fun and hooky Fucked Up are when theyre in the zone, and in many ways its a simpler, spiritual precursor to this record. Regardless, David Comes to Life is absolutely worth the commitment, a convincing demonstration of what can happen when a band works without limitations.",

        "article_text": "Syracuse five-piece Perfect Pussy sound like a hardcore band fronted by Joan of Arc: A swirling maelstrom of fire engulfs a singer who shouts with the ecstatic conviction of someone who would rather die than apologize. Following a searing, four-song demo tape released last year, their proper full-length debut Say Yes to Love is an unrelentingly intense experience—23 minutes of five people pushing themselves to their absolute limit. Frontwoman Meredith Graves has called the bands songs \"happy revelations about incendiary events,\" and this remains the most fitting description of their music. It doesn’t feel corny or hyperbolic to call this record life-affirming, so perfectly does it capture the flashes of gratitude, self-knowledge, and inexplicable joy that often follow an experience of great pain.\nA Perfect Pussy song comes together in layers, and the group’s writing process is a kind of sonic avalanche. Graves has said that her bandmates Ray McAndrew (guitar), Garrett Koloski (drums), and Greg Ambler (bass) usually record a totally clean track first, and then she and keyboardist Shaun Sutkus come in and \"make noise on purpose.\" That approach gives these songs an energy that is both chaotic and collaborative—the instruments sound like theyre wrestling each other for space instead of working in harmony. And the textures of the eight songs on Say Yes to Love are damaged but also luminous; even at its most assaultive moments, like the gale-force ripper \"Advance Upon the Real\", jangly chords and a bright melody shine defiantly somewhere below the surface.\nSay Yes to Love is so relentlessly pummeling that its almost meditative, and its songs are caked in so much sludge its often hard to make out what Graves is saying. Until, very suddenly, its not. You know the feeling when youre in a place thats so loud and crowded that you have to scream into the ear of the person next to you, and then suddenly the room goes quiet and now everyone can hear you? And how this always seems to happen when youre saying the most private and potentially embarrassing thing? In a Perfect Pussy song, this happens to Graves constantly—\"AND I WANT TO FUCK MYSELF/ AND I WANT TO EAT MYSELF,\" she is caught saying in one of these moments of jolting clarity. But a great power emerges as she delivers even her most vulnerable lines without a twinge of shame. She sounds emboldened by silence, her presence growing to fill it, like a person whose voice has been stifled and is now overjoyed by the chance to be heard.\nIts easy to be overtaken by the primal force of this music but theres also an incentive to dig deeper. Say Yes to Love is a convincing argument for reviving that practice of reading along with the lyrics while listening. Graves lines are full of vivid, visceral, and often unsettling images (\"You can read the story of my last six weeks/ In little black bruises and marks from boys teeth\") and the sort of bold confessions plenty of people wouldnt tell their best friends. And her delivery is at once shit-kickingly tough and childlike, sometimes reminiscent of Life Without Buildings vocalist Sue Tompkins wide-eyed swagger.\nPerfect Pussy have been criticized for the buried vocals and often unintelligible lyrics, but the approach serves a purpose. Theres tension in this music between vulnerability and defenses, between the things we tell each other and the things we feel the need to keep hidden. The lyrics to songs like \"Interference Fits\" and \"Dig\" (which meditates on sex and violence) are so intense that hearing every word could almost be a distraction—itd be hard to pay attention to anything else. So youre given a choice of how to experience these songs: You can lose yourself in the rush, or you can follow along and think more closely about what theyre trying to say.\nThere are a few moments in \"Big Stars\" when the feedback squall sounds like its bleeping out something Graves is saying. If its intentional, its a pretty good joke about arbitrary censorship—a topic Perfect Pussy know well as theyve quickly gone from being evangelized in limited-run underground zines to being covered in publications too refined to print their name. But an irony that were just starting to understand as a culture is that, for women in particular, the first word in Perfect Pussys name is much more obscene than the second. If youre female, its far more socially acceptable to express self-deprecation than self-love, and its more acceptable for anybody to express numbly detached nihilism than Perfect Pussys particular brand of hard-won, audaciously blazing joy. Something about Say Yes to Love—the way Graves bright, confidently optimistic vocals are threatened to be drowned out at every turn—speaks to the forces that make women in our society feel like they must exist in a constant state of perceived inadequacy. And fuck all that, says Graves at the end of the careening \"Dig\": \"If Im anything less than perfection/ Well shit, nobody told me!\" Say Yes to Love is one of the hardest and most jarring records Ive heard in a long time, not because its trying to shock you with darkness, but because its unafraid to stare directly into the light.",

        "article_text": "If your interest in Sunn O))) stems primarily from the bands patient employment of tone and time as channeled through electric bass, electric guitar, and stacks of amplifiers, you might hate \"Alice\", the brilliant closing track of its seventh and arguably best album, Monoliths \u0026 Dimensions. Sure, these 17 minutes are loud and torpid, easing from one note to another, distortion dripping from each new intonation. But \"Alice\" finds Sunn O))) exploiting a newfound spaciousness and elegance. As its founders, Greg Anderson and Stephen OMalley, crawl across a loose blues progression that mirrors those of slow metal fountainhead Earth, a swell of French and English horns, violin and viola, harp and light percussion rises. Surrounding the guitars, theyre like the perfect summer haze, refracting and softening the seasons relentless sunlight. \"Alice\" ends with a fanfare of sorts for this small orchestra. Its long tones are light and lifting, a little like Stars of the Lid commissioning Igor Stravinsky. More Fluorescent One than Black Two, its completely unexpected, mesmerizing, and beautiful.\nWell, not completely unexpected: Like the rest of Monoliths \u0026 Dimensions, \"Alice\" offers a culmination of most everything Sunn O))) have done right during their decade of volume-based plunder. Anderson and OMalley have long rendered rock riffs with painstaking deliberation, consistently adding the ideas of elite collaborators and occasional no-explanation experiments. The Grimm Robe Demos took to early Earth, while Black One ground an Immortal black metal burst into one 10-minute tectonic motion. Merzbow, Xasthurs Malefic, Thrones Joe Preston, and Mayhems Attila Csihar stood among high-ranking contributors. Pieces like \"bassALIENS\" (23 minutes of electric bass tone exploration) and \"My Wall\" (25 minutes of Julian Cope verbiage battered by cascades of amplifier hum) ensured that Sunn O))) was doing more than swapping chords for feedback.\nMonoliths \u0026 Dimensions takes the idea even further, gathering collaborators-- from Csihar and Earths Dylan Carlson to Australian drone master Oren Ambarchi and vocalist Jessika Kenney, who sang so well on Wolves in the Throne Rooms Two Hunters-- for four tracks that push Sunn O))) in directions unforeseen: Riffs come wrapped in strings. Conch shells share space with upright bass fleets. Both an operatic female choir and Portland noise nut Daniel Menche sing opposite the Mayhem frontman. All told, as on 2007s revelatory Black One, Monoliths \u0026 Dimensions indicates that Sunn O))) and the possibilities of its slow music stretch beyond what we imagined.\nAbout three-dozen people contribute to Monoliths four cuts. Two of these tracks exceed 16 minutes, while their counterparts either approach or encroach on the 10-minute mark. It might seem that only size matters for Sunn O))) here, but thats just the surface. None of these pieces are big for bigness sake. Rather, they all bear intricacies that erode them from within. A given pieces size becomes its fatal flaw. The strings and synthesizers ascend through the gaps in the sluggish riffs of \"Alice\", for instance, composer Eyvind Kang arranging the parts to crack and cover their host. By tracks end, the guitars are gone, ruins eviscerated by a new growth of ivy.\nThen theres \"Big Church\". The female choir led by Kinney, a four-guitar army including Ambarchi and Carlson, and the manipulated Middle Earth incantations of Csihar clash during three three-minute sections. The guitars or the voices invoke each third, and their parts slip by one another like the pieces of an amoeboid jigsaw puzzle. Csihar always overruns them, though, pushing each section into a chaotic climax. On \"Hunting and Gathering (Cydonia)\", Csihar cloaks some of the albums most literal lyrics-- \"They take the world and the earth, breathing fire on the endless oil seas\"-- in his native Hungarian, but the music makes the message clear. Each time Csihar finishes a set of imprecations, a triumph of vocals and horns rises and exalts while the electric riff subsides. This is a new battle hymn.\nAnd theres the albums other giant, opener \"Aghartha\". As close as Monoliths gets to the classic drone of Sunn O)))s past, OMalley and Anderson paw at chords on perfectly engineered electric bass and guitar. Again, a de facto chamber ensemble joins, as a droning Tibetan horn (the two-player Dung Chen) displaces the air beneath the guitars and sharp piano chords splinter whatever they encounter. These sounds sublimate into one drone, forcing the guitars out of the frame before fading into silence themselves. Only the sound of rushing water washes beneath Csihars daunting voice, as he speaks of \"a tunnel [that] gouges in the shapes of the stream in the great abyss of the sky\" in booming, broken English. Hes looking for new sparks to destroy the old order, for fresh energy to upset the established form. And thats exactly what Monoliths \u0026 Dimensions does: It takes one of the worlds most lauded loud bands and rearranges its game with an inspiring cycle of risk and reward.\nPerhaps Black One came with a caveat emptor or two. Youd better like your music dark and relentless, and contextual understandings of Sunn O))) and black metal and drone helped. Lacking those things, perhaps you suspended your disbelief enough to appreciate Malfeics scorched voice or, unfortunately, dismissed it outright as two self-serious dudes and their fucked-up friends dicking around with darkness. Incorrect, I think, but understandable. Monoliths \u0026 Dimensions requires no such warnings. Per Sunn O)))s long-standing dogma, \"Maximum volume [still] yields maximum results.\" But this time, theres enough musical range and temperance to usher even the most resolute naysayer into this intricate wonderland.",

        "article_text": "Among critics and fans, the Nationals third album Alligator has become synonymous with the term grower. Released to minor acclaim early in 2005, the album has since quietly and steadily built up a large, avid listenership. Matt Berningers lyrics-- initially off-putting and seemingly obtuse in their non sequiturs and stray details-- proved unpretentiously poetic over time. His sober baritone and dogged repetition of phrases and passages made it sound like he was trying to figure the songs out in tandem with the listener. The band, meanwhile, played around the hooks instead of hard-selling them, so that in a sense, despite two previous albums and a killer EP, we all pretty much learned how to listen to the National on Alligator, eventually finding deeper shades of meanings in the words, sympathizing with Berningers anxieties, laughing at his grim jokes, and tapping out the bands complex rhythms on desktops and steering wheels.\nIts a testament to the good will engendered by Alligator that fans are now likewise calling the Nationals follow-up, Boxer, a grower. Despite the scrutiny greeting its release (brought on by the inevitable leaks), many listeners seem to be approaching these songs patiently, giving Boxer the space and time to reveal its dark, asymmetrical passageways. In a sense, the album demands it. The same elements that kept listeners returning to Alligator (Berningers clever turns of phrase, the bands dramatic intensity) are present on Boxer, but are now more restrained and controlled.\nFrom the first piano chords on opener \"Fake Empire\", the National create a late-night, empty-city-street mood, slightly menacing but mostly isolated. The 10 tracks that follow sustain and even amplify that feeling, revealing the bands range as they play close to the vest. Aaron and Bryce Dessners twin guitars dont so much battle one another as create a unified layer that acts as a full backdrop for the other instruments, while touring member Padma Newsomes string and horn arrangements infuse songs like \"Mistaken for Strangers\" and the stand-out \"Ada\" (featuring Sufjan Stevens on piano) with subtle drama. But Boxer is a drummers album: Bryan Devendorf becomes a main player here, never merely keeping time but actively pushing the songs around. With machine precision, his fluttering tom rhythms add a heartbeat to \"Squalor Victoria\" and give \"Brainy\" its stalker tension. In fact, the title Boxer could conceivably be a reference to the way his rhythms casually spar with Berningers vocal melodies, jabbing and swinging at the singers empathies and emotions.\nDespite this implied violence, Boxer doesnt have the same aggressive self-reckoning and psychological damage assessment of Alligator. Here, Berninger sounds like hes able to look outward from that mental space instead of further inward. He observes the people around him-- friends, lovers, passersby-- alternately addressing them directly and imagining himself in their minds. Or, as he sings on \"Green Gloves\", \"Get inside their clothes with my green gloves/ Watch their videos, in their chairs.\" He sounds more genuinely empathetic than previously (the accusatory you from the first two albums is thankfully absent), toying with ambiguity and backing away from outright satire. Certain themes continue to prevail: He maintains a fear of white-collar assimilation, addressing \"Squalor Victoria\" and \"Racing Like a Pro\" to upwardly mobile hipster-yuppies (\"Underline everything/ Im a professional/ In my beloved white shirt\"), and clings to his American angst (\"Were half awake in a fake empire\"), as though recognizing the worlds craziness makes him more sane.\nBetter even than these songs are the three mid-album tracks that toy with a love = war metaphor that miraculously avoids the obviousness that implies. On \"Slow Show\", over background guitar drones and a piano theme that echoes U2s \"New Years Day\", he daydreams, \"I want to hurry home to you/ Put on a slow dumb show for you/ Crack you up.\" But the capper is in the coda: \"You know I dreamed about you for 29 years before I saw you.\" That hard-won contentment begins to crumble in \"Apartment Story\", in which the world invades the couples shared space, and in \"Start a War\", where the possibility of loss looms threateningly. \"Walk away now and youre gonna start a war,\" Berninger sings against the bands simple, uncomfortably insistent rhythm, his concrete fears giving the song the extra heft of the personal.\nObviously, its pretty easy to read a lot into the Nationals music and especially into Berningers lyrics, but that shouldnt imply that Boxer is a willfully difficult or overly academic work. Like those on their last album, these songs reveal themselves gradually but surely, building to the inevitable moment when they hit you in the gut. Its the rare album that gives back whatever you put into it.",

        "article_text": "In 1984s The Friday Book, writer John Barth offers a salvo about epigraphs, calling the bits of quoted material \"hokey... one more bit of window-dressing before we get to the goods.\" I disagree. But then, Ive always tended towards indulgence, and I like it when authors (or bands or artists) layer a bunch of other peoples words atop their own text, offering various paths to their own creation.\nThankfully, the Panthers are similarly unafraid of affixing disparate textual voices to their work. No matter which member you tap, the Brooklyn-based band has all sorts of rock pedigree: Justin Chearno was in Turing Machine and Pitchblende (and he did some stuff with Unrest, too) and Kip Uhlhorn was a member of The Red Scare. But if you asked me to choose which parent the band resembles most, Id have to point at vocalist Jayson Green, guitarist Geoff Garlock, and drummer Jeff Salene, all ex-members of Orchid, a band that carried (and tossed) the flames of Guy Debord and Born Against into the late 1990s.\nSure, some people found Orchid heavy-handed. Why not? They quoted lengthily from Albert Camus and Jacques Attali. They peppered song titles with references to intellectual movements (\"Snow Delay at the Frankfurt School\"), applied theories to the lives of angry, good-humored punk-rock kids (\"Lets Commodify Sexuality\", \"Discourse of Desire\"), and the lyrics themselves were engagingly over-the-top: \"I kiss the girls that speak Marcuse/ I kiss the boys that speak Foucault\" (\"Tigers\"). As inspired and fun as I found Greens rants, the thing about Orchid that really allowed them to transcend the label of unsmiling crusty anarchists were their love/sex songs, their humor, and their desire to get folks dancing. And this is where the Panthers pick up the ball and start jogging on Lets Get Serious.\nYeah, they jog. Perhaps taking their name from John Sinclairs White Panther movement, or maybe the Black Panthers, or even the pink bastard himself, the Panthers still toss around epigraphs by French theorists, gangster rappers, and Situationist poets galore; and Green is still on about sexism, fascism, fucking, and being a dick; but the lyrics (and overall political approach) seem less confrontational. Its like the emotive angst of the early years has given way to a bit too much rhetoric. More sinuous and less angry than last years Are You Down?, the new songs manage to move beyond the pit and onto the dancefloor, yet, through the tepid lyrical flow, it sometimes seems like the revolution itself has become a nervous wallflower.\n\"Thank Me with Your Hands\", the first and strongest track here, is David Yow in a romantic mood. Somehow it also cops a slight feel from George Michaels \"Monkey\" (trust me on this). Its a warped, multi-layered MC5 shouting spree with some nice shit about slang and sleeping: \"I was thinking we should sleep in separate beds, but the heats gone to my head/ Lets get tired at the same time (tonight).\" More blues than Orchid ever mustered, its the Laughing Hyenas or some Am Rep band from back in the day; each guitar lines a trampoline, lifting the song to higher levels until things explode into total rock-out ballistics.\nEqually rich, \"Its Not the Heat Its the Humility\" is noteworthy for a weird drum fill that sounds like a violent beatdown and the placement of Notorious B.I.G.s \"I dont know whats more important: my ego or yours\" just above it. The vocal line and lyrics are a bit tired (some late-80s battle of theory and praxis, indeterminability, and death of the author), but the guitars, again, totally rock. Theres also a change during the last minute that brings overdriven Moog and vibraphone to the fore: somewhere amid the sheet of noise theres baritone sax, trumpet, and tenor sax. Fuck Rye Coalition, son, this is what the excess of the 1970s shouldve led us towards!\n\"Post-Fascist Fantasies\", which again has fairly throwaway lyrics, offers (to draw further parallels with The Jesus Lizard) an angular guitar line straight from the book of Duane Denison and, as with the other tracks, plenty of percussion (feedback, hand claps, and shakers). On \"Sexist Not Sexy\" the guitar tracks are upfront, kicking things through the wall and floor-- plus, theres pretty noise at the end: twisting buzzes stop and start, panning in the left speaker, and then tear the sheetrock into powder. Meanwhile, the final track, \"Dont Be a Dick\", offers this: \"My trousers have a nice pleat/ And I enjoy my method of self-defeat/ It suits me...\" The record needs more personalized flourishes like that.\nAll in all, Lets Get Serious is grimy, fuzzed-out goodness, and while the aural trumps the textual time and again (I found myself caring less what the songs were about, and for a band like this thats a crucial slip), its notable that the Panthers can coast by on rock alone: this is, after all, a mighty rad rock record. Still, they have the depth of thought to take it further than this. Maybe next time, if they amp the political angst as loudly as the guitars, the revolution of the everyday will finally have its proper soundtrack.\n ",

        "article_text": "Annie Clarks bold and almost jarringly confident fourth record, St. Vincent, does not sound like it was recorded here on Earth. Its songs sprout with their own strange, squiggly lifeforms and are governed by unfamiliar laws of gravity. Check out the first one, \"Rattlesnake\", a song thats bare, Kraftwerky, and full of imagery that is somehow both Edenic and post-apocalyptic. Clark glances around: \"Am I the only one in the only world?\" She spots the title creature, gasps, and then comes this songs idea of a chorus, like melodic gagging, or distress expressed in an 8-bit video game: \"AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH AHH AHH/ AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH AHH AHH.\" You often get the sense in a St. Vincent song that Clark has touched down on a desolate, previously unexplored planet without an air supply and is showing off the fact that—for the moment at least—she can still breathe.\nGiven the fangs she bares on St. Vincent, it seems like Clark could take that snake, easily. Over the course of four albums, many early-career guest spots, and a 2012 collaboration with David Byrne, Clark has been focusing her vision and sharpening her musics edges; were it not for Google image search, it would be easy to convince yourself that you merely dreamed those days when she wore butterfly wings with Sufjan Stevens and blithely flowing robes with the Polyphonic Spree. With each release, Clark sounds less like anybody but herself, and more forcefully embraces a darkness that was quietly stirring in even her earliest songs. \"You dont mean that, say youre sorry,\" she chimed in a creepy, Bride of Chucky voice on her still-magnificent debut single, \"Now, Now\". But the smirking overlord that stares out from the cover of St. Vincent does not apologize, not for any of the unpleasantries she utters through gritted teeth, nor the much nastier things she blurts out her fingers.\nSt. Vincent continues Clarks run as one of the past decades most distinct and innovative guitarists, though shes never one to showboat. Her harmonic-filled style bears the influence of jazz (she picked up a lot of her signature tricks from her uncle, the jazz guitarist Tuck Andress) and prog rock, two genres known to embrace sprawl. But Clarks freak-outs are tidy, modular and architecturally compact—like King Crimson rewritten by Le Corbusier. Even at its most spazzy, theres always something efficient about St. Vincent. The stark, spring-wound single \"Birth in Reverse\" doesnt waste a second on superfluous sounds, and the same goes for the corrosive crunch of \"Regret\", which sounds like a classic rock song pared down to its most essential elements. All the negative space in that last one makes Clarks riffs hit that much harder, especially when—in one of the most thrilling moments on the album—a solo strikes down out of nowhere like a cartoon lightning bolt.\nCritics of St. Vincent call her pretentious. Fair enough—these are the sorts of songs that dare take themselves seriously and tack on easy suffixes like \"in America\" when they want to let you know they are Making a Statement. But theres an under-appreciated playfulness about Clarks music that balances this out. I cant think of much contemporary guitar-based music that has this much fun with texture—the rubbery whiplash percussion on \"Prince Johnny\", the stretched-taffy vocals on \"Bring Me Your Loves\", the gleefully synthetic-on-purpose sheen of \"Digital Witness\". At best, St. Vincent has a mischievous curiosity about texture (and explosions) that feels almost childlike. Recently my 8 year-old cousin asked me, with a wicked twinkle in his eye, if Id ever microwaved a banana. Im terrified to try, but Im sure whatever happens—splattering, abrupt, radioactive—sounds exactly like an Annie Clark guitar solo.\n\"Whats the point in even sleeping/ If I cant show, if you cant see me?\" Clark asks on the single \"Digital Witness\", a rather on-the-nose critique of our hyper-transparent, Instagram-your-every-meal culture. Its tempting to label St. Vincent Clarks anti-internet album, but that wouldnt be quite right—it knows too well what a life mediated through screens feels and sounds like to be sending it up entirely. (In fact, digital life may have influenced her concise, anti-jam style: \"I have some restless ears, and I now have a fractured attention span because Im like living in the modern world,\" she said in a recent interview. \"So Im like, how do I make this sound interesting to myself?\") \"Huey Newton\" is maybe one of the best songs ever written about falling down a late-night, vaguely depressive internet k-hole (\"Pleasure dot loathing dot Huey dot Newton/ Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter\"); seemingly stream-of-conscious references to Black Panthers, Byzantine architecture, and the Heavens Gate cult flicker by like puzzlingly connected Wikipedia pages. The common threads emerge if you look closely. From the self-coronated Prince Johnny to the \"near-future cult leader\" Clark has fashioned herself on the album cover, theres a fascination with power, faith, and mind-control running through these songs—learning how to sell yourself your own lines well enough to sell them back to other people, too.\n\"I was reading Miles Davis biography,\" Clark says of her Beyoncé-like decision to self-title a record this late in her career, \"and he says that the hardest thing for a musician to do is sound like yourself.\" In that sense, its a perfect title. St. Vincent is the Platonic ideal of a St. Vincent record, executing with perfect poise everything we already know she can do. But this also is why it falls just short of being her best. That honor still goes to Strange Mercy, which had a capacity to surprise and defy expectations in a way that this record does not. Strange Mercy was easier to connect to emotionally (\"If I ever meet the dirty police man who roughed you up,\" she cooed on the title track, a line that was as jarring for its tenderness as it was for its violence) and gave Clark a little more room to stretch her legs in the grooves. The pixelated shredding on \"Huey Newton\" and \"Regret\" are great, but nothing here feels as unhinged as the borealis chaos of at the end of \"Northern Lights\" or the razor-sharp coda of \"Surgeon\". The Bowie-esque metamorphosis suggested by the cover image doesn’t mean she’s reinvented her sound. Of course its not the worst problem for an artist to have, but Clarks become so good at being St. Vincent that, on future releases, she risks boxing herself in. You hope the next album finds her coloring outside the lines shes so meticulously drawn for herself.\nStill, it’s hard to ask too much more from an album that boasts melodies as lovely as  \"Prince Johnny\" and \"Severed Crossed Fingers\". That last one is the best closing song on a St. Vincent album yet—a self-deprecating, slow-motion parade of a ballad that sounds like if Lorrie Moore had written the non-existent lyrics to “Here Come the Warm Jets”. (This song and “Birth in Reverse” both take their wry titles from Moore’s great short story collection Birds of America.) It’s a moment of vulnerability and bleak hope rounding out Clark’s hardest, tightest, and most confident record to date—a vaguely ominous promise of better days ahead. \"We’ll be heroes on every bar stool,\" she vows, sounding so sure of herself that you’re liable to follow her to whatever planet she’s headed.",

        "article_text": "Bradford Cox knows a thing or two about creating a schism between his everyday self and the one he presents on record. In interviews hes garrulous and outspoken, ostensibly brimming with confidence, yet plagued by insecurity. All that self-doubt manifests itself in his solo project, Atlas Sound, where he often sounds small, alone, and cut adrift from the world. At times Cox seems at odds with himself, but dig deeper and theres usually a thread running through his real-world activities and the ideas he obsesses over when recording.\nAnd hes always recording. Last year, Cox released four albums of Atlas Sound demos as the free-download Bedroom Databank series. Its a wonder he can keep track of all his work, but one of his biggest talents-- aside from his rich vein of form as a songwriter-- is as an editor. Not only does he know exactly what to release officially and what to preserve as a blog-only treat for fans, hes also intuitively adept at compartmentalizing material into his Deerhunter and Atlas Sound worlds.\nDespite the separation, those two modes arent mutually exclusive, and its always interesting to see how Coxs two guises feed off each other while retaining strong individual identities. The last Deerhunter album, Halcyon Digest, ended with \"He Would Have Laughed\", built around a spaghetti-like loop of synthesized noise. It mirrors a trick thats revisited just a few songs into Parallax, on \"Te Amo\". Here, Cox leans on a repeating pattern, then pulls away from it by testing the elasticity of his vocal range, stretching into a gruff register hes rarely tried out before. Atlas Sound often functions this way, taking baby steps on the road to evolution and leaving traces of previous material to ground the listener. The two constants are Coxs fascination with ambient music and the unabashed sadness at the heart of his writing. \"When youre down, youre always down,\" he croons on \"Te Amo\".\nCrooning has held Coxs interest for a while now. Versions of Hank Williams \"Im So Lonesome I Could Cry\" and the Rodgers and Hart standard \"Blue Moon\" appeared on his blog back in 2008, and his cover of Joe Meeks \"Valley of the Saroos\" is one of his most impressive giveaways. Lately, Cox has been playing around with image, something he hasnt attempted much since his early dress-wearing days in Deerhunter, and he appears to have settled on a hybrid of Meek-ian high hair and David Bowies plastic emulation of the rocknroll era circa Lets Dance. On the Mick Rock-shot cover of Parallax hes even depicted clutching a vintage 1950s microphone. So its appropriate that this record begins with \"The Shakes\", where Cox casts himself as an idol whos grown bored of fame, money, and hangers-on masquerading as friends. It echoes Bowies weary exasperation at the clamor for fame in the documentary Cracked Actor, where he rides around middle America in a limo and compares himself to a fly swimming around in his glass of milk.\nThat link to Bowie loops back to the Young Americans-style sax solo on \"Coronado\" from Halcyon Digest, further indicating how one Cox project informs his others. But his omnivorous approach to music history, and the restraint that keeps him from drawing too much from his heroes own sounds, makes Parallax a constantly shifting delight. In the past, Coxs affinity for masked vocals allowed him to keep his guard up, stopping listeners from encroaching on his malaise. Here, he uses fewer vocal effects, and the gentle balladry of \"Modern Aquatic Nightsongs\" and \"Terra Incognita\" benefit greatly from it. This cleaner approach to his art demonstrates his growing confidence as a singer and songwriter and feels more involving.\nBut thats only part of the picture. Because Cox likes to confound, surprise, and keep his audience guessing, one of his shiniest pop moments yet lies at the center of this record. \"Mona Lisa\" is a jaunty piece of melancholia-tinged guitar rock, hung up somewhere between the livelier moments on R.E.M.s Green and the rural tug at the heart of the Kinks best material. Comparing this track with the deliberately jaded lyrical framework of \"The Shakes\" highlights one of the most fascinating juxtapositions about Cox; hes so well versed in music history that he knows hell hate the pitfalls that await him if proper fame comes beckoning, and yet his inclination toward deeply accessibile songwriting and infernally catchy pop melodies might drive him in that direction anyway. Theres also more bridge-building on \"Mona Lisa\" and the garage-y \"My Angel Is Broken\", where he sounds confident and vulnerable at the same time, drawing some of that swagger he possesses in real life into his art.\nParallax feels like a more complete work than any other Atlas Sound record, with the differences between the songs less distinct and everything flowing together more naturally. \"Quick Canal\" was a standout on Logos but it also stood alone, feeling like a neat one-off collaboration with a hero (in that case, Stereolab singer Laetitia Sadier) that didnt readily come into focus in the overall picture. There are no such loose strands here, and the closing \"Lightworks\" ends the album wonderfully with a tremoloed guitar shuddering against Coxs hankering vocal line and uncanny pop nouse. Its another testament to his editing skills; he can effortlessly balance a sizable load of contrasting styles and slot them together like its the most natural thing in the world. That lightness of touch is on display throughout this album, providing greater gravitas to Coxs brittle self-examination. Parallax still makes him sound small, alone, and cut adrift from the world, but the way these songs breathe suggests hes more comfortable in his own skin, allowing him to draw his audience closer than ever.",

        "article_text": "Despite the constant influx of catchphrase-coordinated marketing campaigns that would lead you to believe that life-affirming records are released daily, its forever rare to stumble upon one as consistently mind-blowing and aesthetically far-reaching as Dungens Ta Det Lugnt. Because of this scarcity, when such an unexpected (and immediate) discovery does take place, its like being struck by indescribable melodic lightning: Unlike discs that warrant facile disses or mediocre passing grades, the countless reasons for its boundless successes remain ineffable and shadowy despite repeat late-night close-listening sessions.\nSimply put, Dungen exhibit all the signs of legitimate, hard-won staying power. Ta Det Lugnt is an exceedingly triumphant psych-pop oddity that evokes Keith Moons drum fills on The Who Sell Out, the wraiths of unsung bedroom psyche celebrants, and the acoustic sustain and harmonizing of The Byrds Younger Than Yesterday, Ta Det Lugnt feels less like a new release than some ancient tome, a fully formed masterpiece dropped unexpectedly on corduroy laps from some blue-brown sky. Its so aesthetically tight, jangly verdant, and musty that even carbon dating insists that it could not be post-millennial.\nTo be sure, theres a major difference between retro and somehow embodying your parents vintage zeitgeist: Its damn-near impossible to believe that the humming tubes, crackling drums, smoky backdrop, and complexly interwoven melodies on Ta Det Lugnt were birthed in a quick-fix iPod age. But perhaps even more impressive is that, despite the musics headiness and intricacy, its anachronistic results feel unusually effortless, earnest, and unpretentious: Dungen seem driven to this sound not for bloodless cred points, but out of a very sincere devotion to the music from a bygone era.\nAccomplished beyond his years, 24-year-old Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gustav Ejstes is the pin-up mastermind behind Dungens vibrant polish. For the full duration of his third albums 13 bracing tracks, he perfectly inhabits-- and then expands upon-- his homelands late-60s/early-70s acid-rock scene. Ta Det Lugnt particularly taps into the expansiveness of his Swedish psych predecessors, Pärson Sound, while maintaining a murky rocker edge: Imagine that band colliding with The Kinks, or Amon Düül II with Olivia Tremor Control, or Comets on Fire with The Zombies on their way to Terrastock.\nInterested in pushing pop glitter to its limits, Ejstes doesnt go as far afield into psych-pop cliches like chirping birds and hippie atmospherics as his elder brethren, but his equally vintage garage sound allows a definite space for ethereality in the form of funereal dew-drop strings, free jazz breakdowns, brief whiffs of AM radio tuning, flute minuets, lushly cascading pianos, prog time changes, florid medieval chimes, sky-melting freakouts, church organs, fuzz-guitar jousts, doubled mountain-top whistles, roaring six-string solos, and autumnal instrumental interludes. Its obvious his songs are painstakingly arranged with a sense of depth, gradations, and tonal three-dimensionality redolent of something as off the charts as Pet Sounds.\nContinually, theres a perfect push-and-pull between catchy melodies, roaring solos, and spaced-out dramaturgy-- the bands output is consistently upbeat even when heartbreakingly tranquil and melancholy. \"Gjort Bort Sig\" flutters and drifts, reaching for the outer realms, before catching a subtle hurricane of quicksand spirals behind doubled astronaut vocals. The sweet arboreal folk of \"Festival\" appears straightforward until it unleashes an echo-chamber bridge that absolutely shimmers. And the title track feels like chamber-pop expanded to include a psych history lesson.\nBecause I took Latin and not Swedish in high school, I have no idea what Ejstes is singing about, but I like the verbal opacity-- the way syllables meld to the Hammond, flute, violin, bass, drums, guitars, and the way it masks any potentially subpar lyric that might detract from such brilliant arrangements. Indeed, as the summer finally turns to dying leaves, Dungens lush palette of mystical earth tones and trade winds seems the ideal soundscape. This has been one hell of a year for psych, folk, et. al., but even with such fine releases as Animal Collectives Sung Tongs and Comets on Fires Blue Cathedral, I doubt 2004 will birth a more blissful sonic encounter than Ta Det Lugnt.",

        "article_text": "How? Its a question elicited by any great album, but one that accompanied Sonic Youths 2002 return to glory, Murray Street, in particular, and will likely arise in response to any remotely decent effort from the group herein. It might have dawned on some fans only after hearing Murray Street that Sonic Youths mean age was then roughly 45, and that the group arguably hadnt produced a record of such caliber since they were in their late 20s. And while age is certainly unavoidable, as sensitive fifty-something poets constantly remind us, it shouldnt come as any great surprise that the band still pack some alternately-tuned potency in their aging physiognomies: There are manifold examples of musicians in most every genre, besides younglings rock and hip-hop, who have continued playing, if not composing, masterfully, well into their 70s.\nLike the best jazz musicians, Sonic Youth have turned their love for experimental rock into a habit; perhaps more so than any other band, theyve transcended the temporality of quality output in rock music. While bands like the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead continue to take the stage in a larkish clamber, Sonic Youth are still alive in the studio, where the process of making music is somewhat more draining than regurgitating old hits every once in a well-publicized while. With centenarianism becoming more of an improbable reality and less of a tall tale, its no longer inconceivable that rock composers might thrive into their latter days, especially now that the relatively young genre has been given time to produce a few elder masters. In short, Sonic Youth arent an exception; theyre a pioneer example of a nascent rule.\nThat said, while Sonic Nurse isnt quite as strong as its predecessor, its equally as imbued with instrumental dexterity and impressively coherent ideas. Unlike Murray Street, the album isnt so much an expansion of form as a return to it: Here, Sonic Youth harken back to the noisome atmospherics of their late-80s work, only handing it a more crystalline production treatment that smacks of more recent releases like A Thousand Leaves. Whether the implications of the line are intentional or not is difficult to say, but when, on \"Paper Cup Exit\", Lee Ranaldo sings, \"Its later than it seems,\" the band seem to be keenly aware of their age and relevance. That self-awareness, both of an appreciably long canon and the four lives it has traversed, makes Sonic Nurse all the more remarkable.\nThroughout their career, Sonic Youth have indulged in as much avant-garde experimentation as they have ground out formal studio albums. If anything, the lesson taught by mishaps such as the infamous NYC Ghosts \u0026 Flowers is that Sonic Youth are best at being themselves. Fortunately, that \"self\" is an enormously vibrant and sophisticated entity, capable of evoking a broad range of moods and tones, and continually learning from its mistakes. As atrocious as NYC Ghosts \u0026 Flowers was, they never repeated its missteps, and for that it can be conveniently forgotten. Conversely, when the group hits their stride, they know to run with it, as they do here, swimmingly riding the ample momentum generated by Murray Street.\n\"Pattern Recognition\" opens, touching down on a well-trodden playing field of heady, arpeggiated riffage. After a brief, almost proggy intro, the song descends into a perilous odd-time build redolent of \"Candle\", as Kim Gordon brays \"youre the one\" in wontedly Daydream fashion, forgoing the bloodless beat poetry whining that often made her presence an annoyance in recent years. 16 years later, her pipes are still as seductively smoke-tinged as they were on \"Kissability\", and the opener marks the first of several pleasant appearances by Gordon on Nurse. \"Unmade Bed\", the records only sub-four-minute endeavor, recalls the nocturnal second half of Murray Street, casting beacons of beautifully melodic guitar as it builds to a gloriously intertwined climax. As with many of the bands best songs, it takes a few listens for the riffs to sink in, but once they have, theyre indelible.\nDynamically, however, not every track on Sonic Nurse is as striking as the band have proved themselves capable. Murray Streets \"Rain on Tin\" was a euphoric rollercoaster ride that seemed to capsulize to the bands entire career. \"Stones\", perhaps this albums closest parallel to that song, erupts with an insurgent guitar melody after a rocky climb, and features more than its fair share of strong riffs. Yet, while doubtless a strong number, the track isnt nearly as dramatic as career highlights like \"Washing Machine\" and \"Expressway to Yr Skull\". Additionally, \"Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Handcream\" is a more traditional Kim Gordon screed that extends about two minutes too long in its monotonous din to be as effective as Murray Streets similar \"Plastic Sun\".\nHowever, while those tracks do belabor the flow of the record slightly, their impotency is more accurately attributable to Sonic Nurses questionable sequencing. While many of these songs exemplify the band in top form, theyre sometimes inhibited by the records somewhat scatterbrained narrative arch. \"Peace Attack\", in particular, suffers from mishandling. Played in isolation, the track is clever and wistful, but in its role as closing song, it feels awkwardly contrived and anticlimactic. Meanwhile, \"Pattern Recognition\", another one of the bands finest recent tracks, seems too bold an opening statement for this deeply cogitative collection. And unlike Murray Street, which was anchored by the towering middle track, \"Karen Revisited\", this issue lacks a similar axis to corral the disparate tones and give them direction.\nOf course, considering these minor bones of contention, Sonic Nurse is hardly what one might call a disappointment. \"The Dripping Dream\" adheres to the familiar tension/release/jam formula typified by \"Rain on Tin\", but manages to keep fresh with a reliably brilliant guitar apex before receding into a hazy wash that recalls the deliquescent waning minutes of \"The Sprawl\". \"I Love Golden Blue\" features a formless, protracted intro that points to the bands one-time relationship with seminal avant-garde composer/no-wave icon Glenn Branca. And \"Peace Attack\", despite its placement, is quietly poignant in contrast with erstwhile monoliths such as \"Trilogy\" and \"The Diamond Sea\".\nEven the staunchest pundits should find something to like on Sonic Nurse, while steadfast devotees are well accounted for by the records sheer canonical breadth. Though its ultimate placement in the bands legacy is a debate waiting to happen, Sonic Nurse is certainly on a plane with some of Sonic Youths better work. Indeed, it is later than it seems. And for a band to live up to that proclamation on its 19th album is awesome.",

        "article_text": "When attempting to encapsulate the essence of Paris in a word, Evelyn Waugh endearingly deemed the city \"bogus.\" In his travelogue, Labels, he wrote, \"It seems to me this scrap of jargon, in every gradation of meaning... gives a very adequate expression of the essence of modern Paris.\" Thanks mostly to San Dimas High School, in the seventy sum years since Waughs trip, the term-- and bogus journeys, in general-- has evolved into a firm negative. Waugh, however, enjoyed Parisians ability to dismiss nostalgia in art and revel in the present without regard to the future, past, or public reception. In so few words, the French dont give a fuck.\nBecause of this, American audiences continually underestimate French music, assuming our rigid filters of \"authentic\" or \"ironic\" apply. Admittedly, the cultural barrier is difficult to overcome: Daft Punks masked robot disco, Gainsbourgs reggae, and Phoenixs flying-V Steely Dan tribute seem cute and studied when compared to the supposed bleeding-on-wax of our idolized Kurts and Jimis. As such, investing emotionally in \"Sexy Boy\" was akin to a Cubs fan buying playoff tickets. Airs revered debut hit cosmetic commercials within weeks of its release and goes great with a dry Chardonnay. 10,000 Hz Legend opened with synthetic voices proclaiming, \"We are electronic performers,\" before 10cc choruses toyingly queried, \"How does it make you feel?\"\nWhich makes the overwhelming beauty and longing of Talkie Walkie that much more stunning. No longer are Airs sincerities lost in translation. The album title (no, theyre not being cute, thats just how they say it in French) knowingly acknowledges this fact. Like the communication devices, Talkie Walkie sounds intimate, yet distant and distorted. Hope Sandoval nailed \"Cherry Blossom Girl\" on a demo, yet in forgoing guest vocalists for the first time, Air unerringly personalize their songwriting. Stomping piano and opiated gospel handclaps march \"Venus\" in a brutal funereal pace through keyboards that break like dead, pale winter sunlight and falling ice. Tolling bells and crickets take the song into twilight. Somehow its numbingly romantic. Atonal music boxes, Plutonian pings, and digital fugues create a Side One that evokes purgatorial drifting, running out of oxygen, and passing into the light after a Space Walk disaster.\nThe second half with the propulsive \"Surfin on a Rocket\", whistling \"Alpha Beta Gaga\", banjo-laced \"Biological\", and the Japanese imperial garden suite, \"Alone in Kyoto\", reconstitute Brian Wilsons surfing symphonies through Bowie and Enos Berlin flipsides. Nigel Godrich, rather than supplying his default clean, shimmering production that can homogenize artists such as Beck, Travis, and The Divine Comedy, betters some of his Radiohead A-game here. The albums chilling resonance is due in part to Godrichs anagogical recording of minimal instrumentation and digitally etiolated detail.\nBeing the good Parisians of Waughs estimation, Air load Talkie Walkie with images of moonbase love and alien encounters that neither mocks the comically misjudged visions of yellowed science fiction, nor longs for some utopian future. Air creates the alternate now, an environment that begs escapism without denying humanity. Talkie Walkie may mollify Airs overt Frenchness, but should in no way be deemed a sudden opening of the soul. In their insular way, Air have always been soul. Theyve simply grown more cosmopolitan, and not just in their solubility with vodka, Cointreau and cranberry.",

        "article_text": "At some point it became clear that one of the themes for the first quarter of 2015 would be The Return of the Male Piano Balladeer. Upcoming records from Father John Misty, Matthew E. White, and new kid/not-kid Tobias Jesso Jr. (he’s 29) would all center on an archetype now associated mostly with the 1970s: the weary dude, wise beyond his years, spinning tales of love and loss from his piano bench before moving over to a barstool. It’s an image that took hold during the 60s hangover, when baby boomers traded youthful dreams and started becoming their parents, a little less certain with each new season that they were, in fact, still crazy after all these years. This highly personal, smaller-scale music was less about The World and more about the geography of a wounded heart. Jesso, Misty and White, in their own ways, are all drawn to a similar directness, a love of the well-written song composed and performed solo. \nHearing Tobias Jesso Jr.’s album, Goon, it turns out he has less in common with his peers than we thought. Father John Misty’s J. Tillman is by far the most literate and complicated of the three songwriters, using a fictional persona to plumb the depths of his own desires and self-loathing. Matthew E. White is more producer and arranger than singer-songwriter, someone who lets the horn arrangements and mic placement do the talking. And Tobias Jesso Jr. is ultimately more of a wide-eyed innocent, a songwriter with a naturally expressive voice who has a McCartney-like propensity for melody and an innate drive toward simplicity.\nIn the late 60s and early 70s, L.A. singer-songwriters like Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, and Tom Waits got their start by writing songs for others, playing small clubs on Sunset, and skulking around record label offices. Jesso did try writing for others, but his rise could only happen on the Internet: Some songs posted to YouTube, an exchange with an admired producer (in the case of Jesso, Girls JR White), a debut record on a hip label, and a \"The Tonight Show\" appearance before the LP even comes out. This isn’t just luck, of course—Jesso already had some connections from his time living and working in music in Los Angeles and a few famous friends, and his little label is part of the indie juggernaut Beggars Group. But if his quick ascent owes a lot to living in a networked world, his music sounds as natural as breathing. Jesso has a knack for writing songs that you feel like you’ve heard before, even if you can’t quite pin down a precise antecedent. Which is another way of saying he writes songs that sound \"classic\" in the best sense of the word.\nThe highlights here sound like songs that could be covered and interpreted any number of ways by other vocalists, with a rock-solid melodic and harmonic foundation. \"How Could You Babe\" is among them, moving from slow, halting verses that build tension until the glorious release of the chorus. On the last refrain, Jesso pushes his voice in its upper register to the point where it cracks, a clever suggestion of desperation that speaks to his intuitive sense of phrasing. \"The Wait\" is a two-minute acoustic pop confection featuring Jesso on guitar, a weightless gem that floats by like a freshly blown dandelion seed. A pair of songs, \"Hollywood\" and \"Leaving LA\", hint at Jesso’s background as a journeyman musician in Los Angeles, but the main idea behind virtually every song is the precariousness of love and affection.\nFans of those YouTube demos had to wonder how Jesso’s intimate music might hold up to studio glare, but Jesso’s producers (White handled eight songs, Pat Carney of Black Keys two, and Ariel Rechtshaid one) treat his music with a simplicity that suggests utter confidence in the material. The songwriter’s voice, piano chords, and plucked acoustic are the focus, and bits of light drumming and the odd back-up vocal are often the only augmentation. The approach leads to songs that feel unusually whole. You couldnt imagine taking anything away from these songs, and its equally hard to imagine adding anything. \"Leaving LA\" is a masterpiece of sonic understatement, moving between solo piano and a blissful interlude of voices and what sounds like harpsichord. \"Bad Words\" finds Jesso’s voice pinched and distant next to a Fender Rhodes and subtle drumming. His vocal line and piano move in unison on \"For You\" as a violin saws away in the background; it all bleeds together until it feels like a single, intricately textured sound.\nIf Jesso seems to have a Burt Bacharach-like command of how verses, choruses, and bridges can add up to more than the sum of their parts, he’s got a ways to go before giving Hal David a run for his money with the pen. The words are here to serve the music, to fit the rhythm and cadence of the tune rather than the other way around. In a couple of places (\"Crocodile Tears\" and \"Can We Still Be Friends\", which sounds disconcertingly like the theme song from \"Cheers\") that can lead to rhyme schemes so predictable in their girl/world obviousness as to become a distraction. But these moments are few, and Jesso overcomes them as McCartney did—with the sweetness of his voice. \"There’s a thing called hate/ And a thing called love, too/ Like the love I have for your Mom/ And for you\" reads awkwardly on the page, but Jesso’s smooth musical diction makes it sound almost wise. His voice couldn’t be any more suited to this kind of music if it was created in a lab, but beyond just hitting the notes he also has a great feel for inflection, how to squeeze the most out of every syllable and transition.\nWith its clear debt to a specific era, Goon has a meta quality, an album of music that illustrates the power of music. While the songs are almost all about heartbreak, they could be more likely to have you ruminating about the role music plays in heartbreak instead of the emotional pain itself, but this distancing effect, in which the songs unfold so patiently, doesn’t diminish the record’s pleasures. Of the trio of 2015 songwriters mentioned above, Jesso sounds the most like Nilsson, in terms of the grain of his voice and his ability to sound wounded while also floating just above his travails, but his music is very different in spirit; Jesso’s approach is to state things plainly, dress them up in a gorgeous tune, and sit down and deliver it in the most spare and economical manner possible. Goon isn’t an album of layers; what you hear is what you get, which in this case turns out to be something special.",

        "article_text": "Now is the time: breaking the decade of relative silence that followed Sleater-Kinneys prodigious supposed finale, 2005s The Woods, the girls are back in town. We have arrived at the critical reappraisal and celebrated comeback of musics most revered feminist saviors of American rocknroll. It is 2015 and we are staring down Sleater-Kinneys wise eighth album—exactly 50 years removed from the birth of \"R-e-s-p-e-c-t\", exactly 40 years removed from the birth of Horses, exactly 30 years removed from when Kim Gordon first yells \"brave men run away from me\" in the Mojave desert, exactly 20 years removed from Sleater-Kinney, a primal, insurrectionist warning shot from the margins. Ever since, we have had Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein, and Janet Weiss to soundtrack our societal chaos and progressing zeitgeist: tangled agitation, pummeled norms, principled wit, sublimity, sadness, friction, kicks.\nNowadays, there is a prevailing notion that we ought not want such epochal bands as Sleater-Kinney to reunite, because why tarnish the legend of \"Best Band in the World\" acclaim and a perfectly ascendant seven-album streak? But if any band in the past two decades has proved theyve got the intellect, skepticism, and emotional capacity to deserve this—to keep living—its Sleater-Kinney. No Cities to Love is a disarming, liberationist force befitting the Sleater-Kinney canon. Fervent political leftism has been implicit to this Olympia-born trio since they first inverted Bostons \"More Than a Feeling\" on a 1994 comp and that goes on here as well; we desperately need it. It is astonishing that a radical DIY punk band could grow up and keep going with this much dignity and this many impossibly chiseled choruses. No Pistol, Ramone, or unfortunate mutation of Black Flag could have done this.\nThe necessity of change—the creative virtue of ripping it up and starting again—remains a crucial strand of Sleater-Kinneys DNA. This is still them: low-tuned classic rock tropes resuscitated with punk urgency, raw and jagged like Wire compressing crystalline Marquee Moon coils. Weiss massive swoop is still the bands throbbing heart, pumping Sleater-Kinneys blood. But Brownstein has said they set out to find \"a new approach to the band\" and that is true of No Cities to Love. It is no less emphatic and corporeal than punk classics Call the Doctor and Dig Me Out. But unlike their last two albums of monstrous combat rock, No Cities to Love keeps only the most addictive elements—if Sleater-Kinney are still taking Joey Ramone as a spiritual guide, this is their mature, honed, and clean-sounding Rocket to Russia. Catchy as all-clashing hell, its Sleater-Kinneys most front-to-back accessible album, amping their omnipresent love of new wave pop with aerodynamic choruses that reel and reel, enormously shouted and gasped and sung with a dead-cool drawl. The album has the particular aliveness of music being created and torn from a group at this very moment—tempered, but with the wild-paced abandon that comes with being caged and then free.\nAs ever, empathy is Sleater-Kinneys renewable energy source. They have always made a kind of folk music—songs of real people—and opener \"Price Tag\" is an honest example of this, fueled by Tuckers motherly responsibility. In concrete detail, it describes the struggle of a working class family in the context of American capitalism and financial crisis (it rings of the high cost of low prices). Real life power dynamics permeate No Cities, among the rubbery synth lines of the otherwise venomous \"Fangless\" (which I know will frighten off a couple to-the-bone punk purists, like garlic wards off evil) and the anxious post-hardcore lurch of \"No Anthems\", which Albini could have produced. On the glammy \"Gimme Love\", Tucker plainly wants more of that four-letter-word for girls and outsiders (she seems to wish, in the words of de Beauvoir, \"that every human life might be pure transparent freedom\"). Brownstein, meanwhile, sings some of the most elliptical and oblique lyrics of her career: \"I was lured by the devil... Ill choose sin til I leave,\" she hollers like a Bad Seed, clenched and possessed. In lighter moments, its heartening to hear Tucker and Brownstein in unison at the records sing-song center: \"No outline will ever hold us/ Its not a new wave/ Its just you and me.\"\nSleater-Kinney began work on No Cities in earnest around May 2012, they have said, but especially on the anthemic title track and \"Hey Darling\"—the first two songs they wrote—you can hear echoes of that decade of pause, an airing out of just why. The titular phrase is abstract enough, but considering Brownsteins vocal incompatibility with the van-show-van-show tour-life void—and her lines, here, about \"a ritual of emptiness\"—it plays like a direct take on the complicated reality of the rootless rock band and its scattered tribe. On \"Hey Darling\", one of Tuckers gummiest melodies becomes a letter to fans, reasoning her hiding: \"It seems to me the only thing/ That comes from fame is mediocrity,\" and then, \"Sometimes the shout of the room/ Makes me feel so alone.\" The slow-burn of \"Fade\", the closer, also takes on Sleater-Kinneys hiatus. Tucker is like a Robert Plant putting her supernatural quasi-operatic range on display over epic, minor-key hard rock, switching from sly-voiced ballad to high-pitched inflection: \"If theres no tomorrow/ You better live,\" she sings of a dimming spotlight, her slipping self-perception. Its the closest No Cities gets to The Woods feminist rewrite of 70s rock grandeur, and yet sounds like nothing on that record. Sleater-Kinneys discography is full of songs delivering meta-commentaries on what it means to be women playing rock; No Cities is more purely personal and explicitly political, evidence enough that in the context of family, middle-age, and multiple careers, it is possible to have everything.\nFor the first time in 21 years, Sleater-Kinney have written an album without a proper stomach-twisting tearjerker; no wistful confessions, breathless breakups, or dying lovers, no \"Good Things\", \"One More Hour\", or \"The Size of Our Love\". But I predict Sleater-Kinney will be making more people cry this year than ever before—maybe Lena Dunham, maybe Perfect Pussys Meredith Graves, definitely Fred Armisen (tears are highly subjective, and yet my claim is substantiated). \"We tell ourselves stories in order to live,\" Joan Didion famously wrote, and we align ourselves with the potent narratives of great bands for the same reason. Their songs guide us through the restless process of figuring out who we are. We search for meaning in rhythm and couplets and distortion, and if a band is grounded with as much purpose as Sleater-Kinney, they charge our consciousness, occupy space in our relationships, symbolize what we want to become. Sleater-Kinneys music still does this. It tells us—women or anyone who has ever felt small and othered—the truth, that even when the world seems to deny it, we are never powerless. Now the story goes on longer; it didnt have to end.",

        "article_text": "Deerhunter is one of the most fascinating bands going because theyre a democracy functioning the way most of us experience democracy, whether in politics or the workplace: fully participatory, but with a wildly disproportionate power structure. With Bradford Cox fronting the group as one of rocks most dominant personalities, its easy to view Lockett Pundt as following in the lineage of reclusive guitar wizards who serve as a necessary counterbalance.  Whether or not Cox goes off the grid any given night, you can catch Pundt standing catatonically still and staring off into the distance when his gaze isnt intently focused on an armada of effects pedals. \nBased on that persona, no one couldve been surprised by his solo bow as Lotus Plaza, 2009s The Floodlight Collective. A mélange of looped guitar and amorphous vocals slathered in amniotic goo, it wouldnt have stood out in any year, and released smack dab in the midst of indies deadbeat summer, it was the kind of solo record that could only be the result of a guy who goes to the greatest lengths possible to not get noticed. But even if he gets approximately 0% of the good quotes in any Deerhunter interview, the relatively egalitarian division of the bands songwriting labor makes Spooky Action At A Distance every bit as unsurprising as its predecessor. In an infinitely more rewarding way, of course: save for a minute-long intro that recalls Floodlight, these are nine reminders that Pundt also is responsible for soft-focus beauty of \"Agoraphobia\", \"Neither of Us, Uncertainly\", and the juggernaut centerpiece of Halcyon Digest, \"Desire Lines\". This consistency means Spooky Action lacks the galvanizing force of Deerhunter and the unpredictability of Atlas Sound, but in fully realizing its comparatively modest ambitions, its one of the strongest indie rock records of the year so far.\nComparing how Cox and Pundt function in their solo ventures tempts a needless quarterback controversy, but nonetheless, it is helpful to see how theyre complementary. While Atlas Sound allows Cox to indulge in genres, collaborations, and haircuts that wouldnt vibe with Deerhunter, Pundt tends to find inspiration in limitations, patterns and forms. Pundt prefers echoing guitar, slow-moving vocal melodies, and distorted washes that generally signify qualifiers like \"shoegaze\" and \"dream-pop,\" but neither of those really sit well with me. The \"dream\" part implies exaggeration or illogic, while nearly all of Spooky Distance is handcrafted, thriving on structure and restraint-- a constant, kraut-like pulse, strict patterns of verses and choruses broken down into repeating chord progressions, loops, loops, and more loops. \nMoreover, along the lines of Real Estate and especially the War On Drugs, Pundt embodies a wakeful, meditative state associated with various forms of transit: your physical being stays relatively still while being in motion, a symbiosis between human and mechanical effort. I cant help but think of each song here as having some sort of vehicular spirit animal, so to speak. As with \"Desire Lines\", the anti-flash \"solo\" that breaks from the casually soaring chorus of \"Strangers\" could be visually represented as medians on a deserted open road, and the anticipatory effect of its repetition brings the relief of arrival during the final minute of decrescendo. Meanwhile, the timbres on \"Out of Touch\" are fit for a vigorous bike ride, sleigh bells and metallic guitar loops jangling rhythmically over a cyclical kick drum pattern. The shambling acoustic closer \"Black Buzz\" feels just right for foot traffic, and \"Jet Out of the Tundra\" cruises at speed like its namesake, the same handful of chords repeating throughout a remarkably brisk seven minutes while Pundt seamlessly adds and removes trebly acoustic strums, Superball bass riffs, and a gorgeous, one-finger piano melody like hes slowly pulling levers in the cockpit. Spooky Action then plays out like ten self-contained, daily commutes where familiarity brings not contempt but a private joy in recognizing the landmarks and shortcuts.\nLest it seem like Spooky Action is an overly subtle work, its worth reiterating that its 44 minutes are unerringly tuneful and immediate, the sort of thing that seems unambitious until you step back and ask yourself just how many records out there manage to actually pull it off. And Pundts means of cranking out one instantly memorable chorus after another brings to mind someone whos incredibly good at sports wagering: theres surely some intuition and luck involved, but Pundts a guy whos figured out how certain mismatches and trends work to his advantage. To get specific: the hyperextended guitar bends that push \"White Galactic One\" are technically a slight bit off, yet its that serration that demonstrates why things like these are called \"hooks.\" Where a specific minor chord might be more harmonically congruent, Pundt inserts a major and the result finds \"Monoliths\" and \"Strangers\" stocked with ear-turning melodies as opposed to folky familiarity. Heck, its likely the greatest testament to Pundts abilities that Spooky Action is in a major key and dedicated to simple pleasures of escape and memory more often than your typical \"power-pop\" record, and yet it always comes off as warm and generous rather than cloying.\nAnd so while Lotus Plaza is truly a solo project for Pundt, I hear more purposeful solitude than isolation-- like reading a book or swimming laps, \"antisocial\" with all the pejorative connotations removed. Maybe Im reading too much into things, but in light of Deerhunters notoriously volatile personnel dynamic preceding Halcyon Digest, its tempting to hear Lotus Plaza as Pundts platonic ideal for a band, where people are as predictable and helpful as loops and are united in their pursuit of the kind of reverberant pop music that makes perfect sense for the times you most enjoy getting caught up in your own thoughts. Its a common ambition for artists to capture the music that plays out in their head and if Spooky Action is really what Pundts hearing, you cant really blame him for looking so lost within himself all the time.",

        "article_text": "You and I listen to more music than anyone in the history of civilization. I dont mean more than your friend or that guy on that message board who seems to know about every buzz-worthy leaked CD before anyone else, but rather, more than any previous generation of active music fans. Think about all our MP3s and CDRs, the stuff we actually buy, and then add in the music we hear once and immediately declare isnt worth the 45 seconds we spent with it. It almost seems ridiculous, because ultimately, few of us would be willing to recommend more than but a few songs (let alone albums) to anyone outside our close-knit music circles. Digital media was supposed to satisfy the audiophiles with better sound and the businessmen with yet another kind of product to convince us we werent getting everything we could out of music/life. However, its primary effect has been to level musics impact to a similar scale as any other commodity-- outside those few songs we cling to like family, most of it ends up being used as trade-bait, rep maintenance, decoration and garbage.\nIts easy to blame this on the digital age, but then, it seems to have been going on longer than MP3s and file-sharing. Kids have been comparing and competing with record collections for as long as I can remember-- probably as long as my mom can remember, too-- but there must have been a time when our hallowed few songs were the only ones that mattered at all. Maybe during the days when people were more worried about war or disease or how they were going to eat in the winter; was it \"folk music\" they were hearing and singing? I imagine \"entertainment\" and \"self-expression\" werent as valuable as functionality and therapeutic relevance in music.\nDevendra Banharts second full-length (and first of two planned 2004 releases), Rejoicing in the Hands, harkens back to a time before music had so many cultural roles. Its not necessarily an \"old-fashioned\" record, insofar as his performances or songs are concerned. Banharts lyrics are as often seemingly nonsensical as they are evocative or descriptive, and his songs defy almost any conventional form you care to introduce. There are references to traditional American folk and blues, as well as hints of British acoustic folk along the lines of Fairport Convention, Bert Jansch and Banhart favorite Vashti Bunyan (who sings on the title track). However, for the most part, Rejoicing in the Hands is a record concerned with the absolute smallest things in life-- which usually end up being the most important-- helping pass the time when time is the only thing going anywhere. Its unconcerned with the past or the future, and is only too ready to supply songs you could sing after dinner or first thing in the morning. It seems valuable to hear something like \"we have a choice, we chose rejoice\" coming from a new CD, as if that was the only kind of value music was ever supposed to have.\nUnlike Banharts 2002 debut, Oh Me Oh My, Rejoicing in the Hands was professionally recorded, and a few tracks feature backing musicians (including Angels of Light alums Thor Harris, Joe McGinty and Siobahn Duffy). Its far from slick, though, reeking of rustic, homemade charm. Furthermore, it surpasses Oh Me Oh My in both songwriting and Banharts singing. His songs no longer veer into bizarro cadences or witchy vocal overdubs; Young Gods Michael Gira remarks that he didnt want to pigeonhole Banhart as a lo-fi eccentric, and consequently, the singers range of expression (and surprising delicacy) is given full justice.\nOpener \"This Is the Way\" sets forth the unhurried charge, confident in its own idiosyncrasy. Banharts wordless count-off to his subtly accomplished fingerpicked guitar work betrays a casual ideal, even as couplets like, \"I knew, I knew I could stand tall/ I could lay low,\" seem typically Banhartian in their benign whimsy. Likewise, the short guitar instrumental \"Tit Smoking in the Temple of Artesan Mimicry\" seems strangely familiar in its relaxed, uncomplicated feel, as Banharts deceptively intricate lines cross one another like dueling minstrels on the road to nowhere. \"Todo Los Dolores\" even stops down as Banhart forgets the lyrics and has to begin again, much to the chagrin and amusement of a studio companion. If nothing else, Rejoicing in the Hands celebrates the informal and comfortable.\nOther songs seem weightier. \"When the Sun Shone on Vetiver\" features Banhart accompanying his acoustic with angelic slide guitar, and a ghostly violin harmonizing his lead vocal. The midtempo, folky drone underneath his pseudo-psychedelic melodic vocal phrasing contributes to an unearthly ambience. \"Will Is My Friend\" features plaintive piano and double bass accompaniment, and comes off as a midnight country-blues lament for \"Going Back to California\". Closer \"Autumns Child\" forgoes guitar almost entirely, featuring Banharts quivering vocal over a soft, minor-chord piano dirge. Lines like, \"She wanted to leave it, but she could not because it was her own child,\" sound melodramatic on the page, but over the course of song, seem almost offhandedly frank.\nRejoicing in the Hands establishes Banhart as a major voice in new folk music. Not only does it improve on the promise of his earlier releases; it effortlessly removes the listener from the context of the recording. That is, it doesnt seem like an album so much as a collection of road hymns and journals, and small tributes to smaller pleasures. If some people miss the appeal of this stuff in an attempt to digest it as any other product, all the better knowing Banhart will probably keep on rejoicing until forever.",

        "article_text": "In an early scene in the still-fascinating, delightfully bizarre 1958 MGM musical Gigi, a few characters enter a restaurant called Maxim’s. The vibe is Moulin Rouge meets Cheers: a frenetic, turn-of-the-century Parisian haunt where, for better or worse, everybody knows your name. When each couple enters Maxim’s-- yes, couple; somehow you get the sense that it would be social suicide for a respectable lady of the time to step foot in the place unaccompanied-- a crowd of patrons begins to chant in a hushed, gossipy tone. As they whisper the kinds of things that people rarely say aloud (even when they’re thinking them), and the scene draws a bleak, ironic contrast between people’s private thoughts and the outward demands of polite society. “Isn’t she a mess? Isn’t she a sight?” they say as one pair enters. “Let’s invite them out tomorrow night!”\n“There’s something kind of creepy about that scene that I wanted to bring out,” L.A. avant-pop musician Julia Holter said in a recent interview, talking about “Maxim’s I \u0026 II”, a gorgeous (if slightly sinister) pair of songs that appear on her mesmerizing third album, Loud City Song. Holter’s said that the album is her own loose interpretation of Gigi-- both the musical and the original 1944 novella by the French writer Colette (the plot, in the expert, proto-Twitter brevity of a Turner Classic Movie blurb: “A Parisian girl is raised to be a kept woman but dreams of love and marriage.”).\nPlenty of other songwriters might fumble or stiffen when drawing on source material from decades before they were born, but not Holter. Maybe it’s because making a record based on a 1950s MGM musical is actually her idea of keeping things new-school: Tragedy, her 2011 debut, was an ambitious yet intimate meditation on ancient Greek playwright Euripides’ Hippolytus, while her dreamily crystalline follow-up Ekstasis (also a nod to ancient Greece) sounded like bedroom pop made by somebody with pin-ups of Heidegger and Virginia Woolf (and also maybe Laurie Anderson) papering the walls. Holter’s music is learned (she studied musical composition at CalArts) and proudly erudite, and yet not in a way that feels like it’s talking down to the listener. Still, she’s never made a record quite as inviting as Loud City Song-- her first album for Domino and the one most likely to turn skeptics to believers. From the panoramic ballroom swoon of “Maxim’s I” to the twinkling, kinetic chatter of its sequel, there’s an energy coursing through Loud City Song that makes it feel-- more than anything she’d done so far-- breezy, contemporarily resonant, and at all times flutteringly alive.\nLoud City Song is the first album that Holter recorded outside of her bedroom, and-- like a 19th century French literary heroine seeking the therapeutic air of a seaside vacation-- the change in scenery seems to have loosened her up a bit. If Ekstasis had the serene intimacy of home recordings made with the apartment curtains drawn, Loud City Song finds her flinging open the drapes and taking rhythmic cues from the bustle of people below. Much of this newfound dynamism comes from adding new collaborators (and returning to trusted old ones: like Ekstasis, the record was mixed and co-produced by Ariel Pink collaborator Cole Mardsen Greif-Neill) and embracing a more jazz-oriented instrumentation-- trombones, strings, and a double bass all add a little drama, agility, and even playfulness to her sound.\nHolter name-checks old Parisian landmarks like Maxim’s and says she was also inspired by the disconnectedness and buzzing anonymity of her hometown (\"In L.A., its like everyones invisible. Thats why I like it here.\"). But what gives these songs an emotional resonance beyond the confines of her own imagination is the way they capture something universal about the joys and anxieties of living in any modern city. As Holters nimble voice skips between her siren-song falsetto and a more percussive delivery closer to spoken word, the mood of the album is in constant flux: in the menacing “Horns Surrounding Me” the brisk footfall of her fellow passersby evokes claustrophobia, danger and paranoia (is she being chased? Or is it all in her head?), but by the next song, the playful pop-cabaret “In the Green Wild”, she’s looking at her fellow pavement-pounders with a sense of bemused wonder.\nStill, it’s the album’s centerpiece, a hypnotizing six-and-a-half minute rendition of Barbara Lewis “Hello Stranger”, that might just be the most uncomplicatedly gorgeous thing Holter’s ever done. It’s risky to tackle a tune that’s been covered enough times to make it feel like a modern-day standard, but Holter’s atmospheric take finds a particular strain of longing and serenity in the song. Its a heart-stopper. Amidst the rest of Loud City Song’s chatty, high-concept vitality, “Hello Stranger” is a moment of comfort and instant connection, like suddenly spotting a familiar face on a busy street.\nThough there’s definitely a narrative arc to the record, it doesn’t stick so close to the Gigi script to become tedious; Loud City Song moves with an internal logic that’s more impressionistic than literal. Some of its pieces do stand sturdily on their own, but taken in one sitting the album unfurls like one long, thoughtfully arranged composition-- lyrics and images recur, and characters gradually evolve. The narrator at the center (Gigi? Holter? Some kind of poetic hybrid of the two?) begins as a detached, observant outsider-- just another anonymous face gazing curiously at the city below from the perch of her fifth-floor walk-up (\"I dont how why I wear a hat so much,\" Holter sings beneath the sparse groan of a cello on the opening song, \"World\", \"The city cant see my eyes under the brim.\") But by the end-- the second-to-last track, “This Is a True Heart” prances like a lazy-Sunday carousel ride-- she sounds not only more vulnerable but lighter, too. In a way, the arc of Loud City Song mirrors Holter’s artistic evolution: Ekstasis found kindred spirits in statues and goddesses (“I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry,” she repeated on “Goddess Eyes II”, cloaked in a vocoder), but the psychologically complex narrator at the heart of Loud City Song moves like flesh and blood.\n“There’s a flavor to the sound of walking no one ever noticed before,\" Holter chants in a rapt whisper throughout \"In the Green Wild\". Its a telling line: Loud City Song is one of those records so full of un-jaded wonder and attuned to the secret music of ordinary things that the world looks a little bit different while its playing. I dont think I fully appreciated it until I listened to the whole thing while looking out a second-story window onto a crowded street during rush hour, watching an endless procession of people with eyes hidden to the city under the brims of hats (or, to update Holters image, staring down at their iPhones). To the tune of \"World\", I started wondering who they all were, where they were rushing, and what they were thinking. Though it draws upon the distant past, Julia Holters made a timeless people-watching soundtrack: an acutely felt ode to the mysteries of a million passersby, all the stars of their own silent musicals.",

        "article_text": "\"These zooted brown weirdos is wildin but they can really rap/ Saw the cover of the tape, figured its pretty wack/ Later on eventually admitted that its pretty crack.\" Thats one of the most pedestrian lyrics on the dense, witty, complex Sit Down, Man but its a good summary of the 180-degree turn Das Racist have pulled in 2010. Sure, plenty of people liked \"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell\", but when you lead with a presumed novelty song, the bar for your career tends to be set pretty low. But the trio followed that with the slept-on Shut Up, Dude mixtape and all of a sudden lowbrow humor gives way to subversive social commentary and a culturally literate wit that was too hilarious to immediately draw attention to how really fucking smart it was.\nJudging by Sit Down, Mans impressive production roster, a lot of fellow artists embraced the Shut Up mixtape. The sheer variety and quality of those producers arent just important co-signs, however; they provide a context for Das Racist to bring their best.  It also opens them up to the fruits of collaboration and, over 80 minutes, diversifies their sound. Despite the range of collaborators, Das Racist never have to break character, whether going abstract and abrasive with El-P, bareknuckle street brawling with Roc Marciano, counting major label young money with Boi-1da, or canoodling to Teengirl Fantasys wobbly R\u0026B.\nThe stars of the show though are clearly MCs Kool A.D. and Heems, who here blow their previous work out of the water. Heems told The Village Voice he chooses beats \"so Talib Kweli fans wouldnt like it,\" but while Das Racist go great lengths to separate themselves from the pejorative connotations of \"lyrical hip-hop,\" the main draw are the lyrics. Das Racist turn rap into Calvinball, making and breaking the ground rules with no warning whatsoever: One moment, theyll be calling Mobb Deeps Prodigy \"more Picasso than Schnabel,\" and the next theyll be doing cold-rock-a-party Q\u0026A-- \"you puff herb?\" \"Dog, I smoke weed too!\" Or, in what I guess could be a one-line summary of Das Racists mindset: \"Im counting Jacksons with black friends/ Im counting tens in Benzes with white friends/ Wonderin if suicides a largely white trend/ Google it later and confirm that, aight then.\"\nTheres precedent in the hyper-referential raps of Beastie Boys and MF Doom as well as the abstract-gone-mainstream wordplay of Dipset and Lil Wayne, but Das Racist are a singular act. Google and Wikipedia get several shoutouts, and it makes sense since everything under the sun is fair game for these guys, but they never rhyme for the sake of riddlin. The lyrics themselves have an orderly and logical nature about them, pop culture crosswords that draw connections between completely unrelated objects. Listening to their music doesnt require deep cultural or musical knowledge to enjoy it-- its pretty damn enjoyable purely as pop-- but youll get more of a charge from it the more often you decode it. In that sense, Das Racists music feels closer to Girl Talks than any other current rapper.\nDas Racist could stand accused of sinking into trivia as a means of obscuring a certain sort of modern emptiness, but in between all the proper nouns are some disarmingly humane moments. The Brooklyn group Keepaway lends \"Amazing\" a sparkly, champagne-spilling luxury as Heems gives a tender, relatable treatise on the effects of soft substance abuse. Though he notes that fan interaction tends to be way friendlier when you rap about weed, he reminisces about a youth of \"Yo! MTV Raps\" cards and Nautica sweatshirts and realizes \"we used to play basketball, then we started drinking.\" Meanwhile, on the Diplo-produced \"You Can Sell Anything\", A.D. bemusedly imagines a record exec thinking, \"maybe we can cake off the weirdos,\" while Heems kicks a bravely honest and timely verse where he \"celebrate[s] the fact I moved back into my moms basement,\" seeing the bright side of having no rent and the freedom to \"sell old books for new ones,\" do shows, and hang with guys like Diplo.\nAnd yet, although the upgrade in production and increased confidence in their lyrics are certainly a big part of Sit Down, Man, the most important growth for Das Racist is that theyre learning how to write songs instead of just rap for four minutes at a time. Most people whove enjoyed Das Racist to this point probably wouldnt mind if they stuck with the latter, but for people who dont share their encyclopedic knowledge of turn-of-the-century mainstream rap, the sheer density of that would understandably be exhausting. Sit Down, Man works every bit as well in a house party as it does for a solitary geek-out session: the coked-out couture-rap of \"Fashion Party\" shows surprisingly easy chemistry with indie mystics Chairlift and should be appreciated by anyone whos ever felt odd at a gallery event but enjoyed the free booze.  And while theres plenty of recognizable interpolations (Jay-Zs \"Run This Town\", \"Days of Our Lives\", the Very Bests \"Julia\", \"We Are Family\", \"People Are Strange\", \"Addams Groove\"), perhaps the best is where they feed Enigma a couple of Irish car bombs and turn \"Return to Innocence\" into a drunken singalong.\nSome may still resist embracing Das Racist, but I imagine its not so much a matter of race or privilege, though they do have a lot of fun playing with those two issues. Its more reflected in their hook from \"hahahaha jk?\"-- \"were not joking, just joking, we are joking, just joking, were not joking.\" Its always difficult to convince someone that a rappers the real deal with \"theyre really funny\" as the selling point, since it gives the impression that neither you nor the artist appreciates the daunting cultural import of hip-hop. Its the same reason a lot of us would reserve a circle of hell for \"comedy rappers,\" who figure that the mere medium of rapping is funny and let that do the heavy lifting. Thats not how Das Racist roll: They kid because they are deeply and madly in love with hip-hop, and Sit Down, Man is an infinitely entertaining result of extreme reverence toward rap and irreverence toward everything else, themselves included.",

        "article_text": "Before Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian assumed fame as a feudal right, Angelyne cruised Los Angeles in her flamingo pink Corvette. License plate: ANGELNN. If her teased platinum wig or volleyball breasts led you to mistake her for a pornographic Dolly Parton, her true identity could be confirmed by the ubiquitous advertisements for herself that she purchased on billboards and bus shelters. Even though practically no one could tell you what she did or had done, she became an 80s Southern California fixture as iconic and purely ornamental as the palm trees—the sunshine daydream to Elvira’s ghoulish noir.  The tragedy is that she peaked before Bravo. Without a reality show to channel the day-to-day eccentricities of Angelyne and her candy-dyed Maltese, the O.G. avatar of \"famous for being famous\" had to settle for a bit part in Earth Girls Are Easy, a brief gubernatorial run, and a self-released album on her Pink Kitten imprint.  \nIn a city where Mr. Incredible brawls with Batgirl while Chewbacca and Freddy Krueger vainly break it up, Angelyne naturally still finds work in the meet-n-greet racket. Her most recent appearance was yesterday at Origami Records in Echo Park, as part of Ariel Pink’s \"Tantalising [sic] Tinsel-Town Take Over.\" Should you have missed the mass email, the promotional docket for Ariel Pink’s latest schlock-opus Pom Pom included \"Delicious Donuts and Delectable Ditties\"; \"Pretty in Pink. Permanently\" (where \"L.A.’s top manicure artists\" did nails in only pink); and the \"Luxuriously L.A. Limo Listening Luau\". The latter offered a \"ride in style\" to \"enjoy L.A.s finest sites\" in a \"pink stretch job.\" RSVP did not guarantee entrance. \nIt’s usually over-simplistic to extrapolate from a marketing scheme, but in Ariel Pink as with Angelyne, the medium is the message. The campy flair, smirking irony, and deliberately \"retrolicious\" alliteration matches the scarecrow-genius of his new album, Pom Pom. By wheeling out the inflatable mummy of Angelyne, the former Ariel Rosenberg wryly casts himself as her timeless prom date in the Hollywood Babylon of conniving prophets, sexualized excess, and sterling self-mythologizers.  \nA decade ago, Pink crept out of his rented room in an ashram off Crenshaw with reels of spindly, self-destructing love songs. Issued on Animal Collective’s Paw Tracks imprint, The Doldrums (and later Worn Copy) inspired chillwave and a lo-fi revival, as well as altering the perception of L.A. as an indie-rock backwater. Pink was the sunshine and noir dialect rolled into one, writing gorgeous heat-warped AM pop made to soundtrack driving off of a cliff on Mulholland or save an animal from drowning in a shimmering David Hockney swimming pool. \nThe intervening years have seen him transform from wraith to wolf. The romantic cult hero fantasies have given way to headlines that he’s the \"most hated man in indie rock.\" The analog necessity of his early work has been replaced by studio sheen, alienating those inclined towards the cassette hiss and rawness of his first wave. Pink’s compared social media vilification to the Rwandan genocide, dated porn stars, called Grimes \"stupid and retarded\" and scored a werewolf film—inevitably empathizing with the antagonist.\nIf you hate Ariel Pink, nothing in this review can possibly alter your opinion. You’ll scour the record for misogyny, say it’s too long, and roll your eyes at the helium disco-grooves about getting white freckles at the tanning salon and the amphetamine jingles for Jell-O. You think he’s funny or you don’t. If you do, the best engagement is one of suspended disbelief. After all, the CalArts alumnus remains the stylistic next-of-kin to Frank Zappa: satirical, divisive, and more interested in terraforming genres than neatly deconstructing them. \nBut for all the arch humor and affectation, Pink writes some of most wistful and peculiarly moving songs in contemporary music. \"Put Your Number in My Phone\" feels like David Crosby covering 2Pac’s \"What’z Ya Phone #\". Despite the 60s Sunset Strip jangle, the terrain shifts to the Eastside, a Silver Lake taco truck where Pink sweetly begs for the chance to get to know a girl better, before promptly blowing her off—which we hear in uncomfortably Drake-ian Voicemail detail. It’s the paradox at the heart of the collection and what ultimately makes it so compelling. Beyond catchy melodies, there’s a constant agitation between Pink’s moonlit dreams and everyday pessimism. He wants to be the romantic lover of fiction, but turns out to be just another undependable disappointment—but at least he admits it.\nThere’s \"Sexual Athletics\", where the sleazoid of the first half makes preposterous pull-your-dick-out boasts about being the \"Sex King on a velvet swing/ Waiting for my Alice in Wonderland.\" The coda descends into lo-fi clatter and a tender, Four Seasons-falsetto about his life-long desire for a girlfriend. The ironic shell is always there, lest you get too close to treating the songs like journal entries, but the emotions remain conflicted and unconcealed. \nIf 2012’s Mature Themes found him recovering from a break-up by concocting Kinski Assassin Who Shagged Me daydreams during hungover wanderings to the Highland Park Wienerschnitzel, Pom Pom is Pink on the prowl—with its attendant sexploits and screwups. Sometimes, the tales are in villainous character. \"Four Shadows\" recasts Station to Station-era David Bowie as a comically morbid goth. \"Black Ballerina\" chronicles the night that \"One-Eyed Willie\" took \"Shotgun Billy\" to L.A.’s finest strip club for his first (short-lived) exotic dance experience. \"Lipstick\" concerns a predatory pick-up artist flashing his teeth and threatening to suck a girl into his darkness. There are new wave synthesizers, demands to be showered in blood, and Pink’s best \"Hey Little Girl\" baritone. It might be the finest Cure song since \"Friday I’m in Love\".\nOther times, there’s no need for subterfuge. The album’s finale, \"Dayzed Inn Daydreams\", refurbishes an old track from Odditties Sodomies Vol. 1 with unnatural poignancy. The goofy voices and bipolar shifts are jettisoned for a straightforward psych-pop song in the vein of Love’s Forever Changes. It’s difficult not to read as a veiled statement of purpose: an anachronism to when his greatest fear was dying young and anonymous, a musical John Kennedy Toole, with hundreds of unheard songs his only hope for posthumous recognition.  \nThe rest of the songs comprise crooked detours through Pink’s hometown. Fellow passengers include: Kim Fowley, the immemorial L.A. gadfly who played \"hypophone\" on Freak Out!, co-wrote with Warren Zevon, and managed the Runaways; Don Bolles, the drummer from the Germs; novelist Alex Kazemi (\"Not Enough Violence\"), and producer/writer Justin Raisen (Charli XCX, Sky Ferreira).\nBut the zigzags and bizarre pit stops are clearly at Pink’s behest. Opening track \"Plastic Raincoats in the Pig Parade\" finds him hallucinating cocaine banks, Tokyo nights, and Arkansas moons over what sounds like psychedelic Ringling Bros. polka. \"Dinosaur Carebears\" riffs on Syrian wedding music, shifts to a Tweedledum and Tweedledee melody, and then finds Pink role-calling random L.A. neighborhoods: Tarzana, Reseda, the City of Industry, Beverly Hiiiiiiilllls. Finally, the groove switches to a cosmic space dub.\nThis is no haven for conventional logic or normative restraint. \"Negativ Ed\" is pure Zappa homage, a gym class anthem for delinquent rebels in an 80s B-movie. It’s ridiculous and superfluous, but also endearingly whimsical. The same goes for \"Nude Beach a Go-Go\", a time warp to the Malibu surf rock of the Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello era. But unlike the beach blanket bingo wholesomeness of the censored past, Pink reimagines it as the nude mating ritual it probably was.\nOne of Pink’s strongest gifts is making the absurd seem real and the real seem absurd. If this album has a closest predecessor in his catalog, it might be Worn Copy, with its weary refrain that \"life in L.A. is so lonely.\" His coping strategy remains a rich fantasy life, of which he’s occasionally the star and sometimes the sardonic observer. You can see it on \"Picture Me Gone\", a haunting meditation about how digital technology will erase all physical evidence of our pasts. Set in the near future, the narrator’s age keeps changing. Even at his most sincere, there is something protean and shifty. Or as Pink seemingly indicts himself on \"One Summer Night\": \"Fantasies and fallacies/ All fairy tales and lies/ Time is running out yeah/ Better write these lines.\" Or maybe you prefer \"Exile on Frog Street\", in which Pink does his best karaoke of Jim Morrison circa \"Celebration of the Lizard\". The song concerns an \"enchanted frog... waiting for his Princess Charming to come and kiss him on his frog lips.\" When the kiss finally comes, the toad turns into Ariel Pink. You hear the fairy tale magic twinkle of a Disney soundtrack. Then you hear a frog’s ribbit.\nYou can interpret this as another surreal metaphor in his search for enchanted love or chalk it up to a teenaged fixation with the Doors. Maybe a little of both. He can be the frog prince, Shotgun Billy, or ride shotgun in a pink corvette. He can be a rocknroller named Ariel from Beverly Hills, complete with his own billboards. And in a place where delusion, self-reinvention, and wish fulfillment have long been the principal cash crop, who are we to tell him otherwise?",

        "article_text": "Hip-hop, one of Americas last bastions of regionalism, is threatening to exalt itself out of its local roots. Authenticity issues still insist the genre is tied to the street, but where a hip-hop province used to be as compressed as the South Bronx, its now as sprawling as the Dirty South. Even during the dichotomy of the pre-Chronic days, when East almost never met West, entire coasts counted as local wards. Ten years later, hip-hop is pop music in America, and its global reach is arguably greater than rocks has ever been. From Missy and Timbalands tabla to Jay-Zs bhangra beats, The Neptunes Eastern flavor to dj/Ruptures ragga/Nubian/chart-hop mashups and the Diwali-led rise of Jamaican dancehall, U.S. hip-hop is finally engaged in a two-way dialogue with the rest of the world.\nOn his debut album, Boy in Da Corner, 18 year-old Dizzee Rascal instantly stakes a claim that East London is hip-hops next great international outpost. East London: Rascals world is precisely that small, and it returns a sense of rueful perspective to hip-hop lost among the soundtrack tie-ins, Godzilla-aping Bone Crusher videos, and 50 Cent-style mixtape mythmaking. In basic ways, Rascal echoes the wish fulfillment of much of American hip-hop, but hes hardly mimicking their act. Rascal is at ground level, eyes trained on his immediate surroundings. His rhymes, and especially his beats, reflect his areas desperate social, economic and political landscape. Often, this desolation hardens an emcees psyche (Styles gets high every day to combat his mental strain) or delivery: This summers post-ecstasy swing toward punishing sounds and pugnacious looks threatens to bleed the personality, humor, and adventure out of hip-hop. But to wunderkind Rascal, the accelerated disintegration of his immediate world pains him-- absolutely wounds him-- and its the Tupac-esque mix of brio and vulnerability, along with his dexterous cadence and gutter beats, that separates his rhymes from the typical money/cash/hoes triptych.\nOn the opening track, \"Sittin Here\", Rascal concludes, \"I think Im getting weak cause my thoughts are too strong.\" Over ambient sounds of sirens and guns, he laments, \"It was only yesterday/ Life was a touch more sweet.\" Most people Rascals age crave arrested development, but Dizzee already longs for the innocence of childhood. And yet, the boy in da corners emergence from adolescence isnt the start of a self-imposed purgatory-- life on the dole, or at university-- its spent cowering, crouching and ready to pounce, and most of all, watching. Little of what he sees is pleasant: a cycle of teenage pregnancy, police brutality, and friends lost to the lure of crime and cash (if theyre still alive at all). Whats perhaps worse: For all of his concern and meditation, Dizzee himself offers few suggestions and little hope. He can dish bravado with the best emcees, but despite the eloquent boasts, he remains fragile, apprehensive, and consumed by the possibility of failure. \"Ill probably be doing this, probably forever\" is as convincing a career boast as Dizzee can make.\nThe hesitation and anxiety in that claim could also double as a question: whether Rascal will dabble in hostility forever. On \"Brand New Day\", he touchingly wonders if estate violence is youthful folly that he and his mates will outgrow. Over a bittersweet melody that sounds like a blend of an Asian music box and a Lali Puna lullaby, Dizzee asks, \"When we aint kids no more/ Will it still be about what it is right now?\" For someone with enough of a big-picture grasp to announce that hes \"a problem for Antony Blair,\" theres something tragic and poignant about Rascal wondering aloud if settling scores with organized violence is a mere childs game.\nRascals curiosity about adulthood and responsibility doesnt, however, extend to fatherhood. Although he has girls on his mind, theyre approached with suspicion. \"Love talks to everyone/ Money talks more,\" a female emcee insists on \"Wot U On\"; \"Jezebel\" laments the cycle of teen pregnancy, blaming a promiscuous girl for bringing other future Jezebels into the estate. And on \"Round We Go\", a ringing \"hey\" (borrowed, Just Blaze-style, from The More Fire Crew) echoes the repetition and similitude of a series of loveless romantic entanglements sexlessly listed by Dizzee. Most strikingly, his debut single \"I Luv U\"-- recorded at the age of 16-- is a he-said/she-said snipe between an unmoved could-be father and a friend of the girl that could be \"juiced up.\" Its a harsh amalgam of atonal bleeps and blips, washes of gabba sound, and low, harsh bass, fitting for the tracks ultimately selfish approach to the impending consequences (\"Pregnant/ Whatya talkin about?/ 15?/ Shes underage/ Thats raw/ And against the law/ Five years or more\"). Its among the records most captivating, visceral moments.\nIts on \"I Luv U\" that Rascals sound most nods to the hollow shell of UK garages end days, just before the champagne went dry and the world economys bubble burst. UKGs move from feminized, R\u0026B; club music to breakbeats and emcee bravado created a thrilling light/dark duality into which So Solid Crew stepped, and it seemed as if theyd be the ones to put South London on the international hip-hop map. When the press and record buyers began to ignore UKG in droves in 2001, SSCs strength in numbers (their crew has upwards of 20 members) seemed like an urgent plea for attention. They got it: \"21 Seconds\" shot to #1 on the UK charts, which secured for the collective a memorable Top of the Pops appearance, during which almost all of their members were crammed onto the BBC studios bulging stage. Of course, they were aware that the sheer size of their group had benefits as well as limitations: The title \"21 Seconds\" referred to the maximum amount of time any one member could spend at the mic on any given track. This faceless, monolithic look and sound provided their music with a rare and unique power, but was eventually their undoing as well.\nWith UKG seemingly left in tatters, Rascal and pirate radio cohorts crawled into the wreckage, reconstructing its grimiest bits and blending them with RZAs paranoid minor chords, some off-kilter electro-glitch, the low-rent nihilism of Cash Money and No Limit, and the ghosts of ragga-jungle. Sparse and ugly, Rascals record is an icy orchestra of scavenger sounds, owing as much to video games and ringtones as it does to anything more overtly musical. The despairing beats make the lyrical push and pull that much more severe: When Dizzee is venomous, they sharpen his bite; when he gamely searches for the light at the end of the tunnel, admits his failures, laments his unraveling psyche, and battles with depression, they seem like obstacles.\nDespite Boy in Da Corners garage roots, it couldnt rightly be called \"dance music.\" There are still traces of those long-gone days when hyping the crowd or extolling the virtues of the drugs or the music were about all a British emcee would provide, but theyre nods at best. On \"2 Far\", a helium-voiced claim (\"Im the fitness instructor\") tips its hat to a rave emcee leading a crowd through its all-night workout, but now such calls are relegated to the periphery. Instead, the language-- which had often remained subservient to the beat in the UKs previous attempts to grapple with hip-hop (trip-hop, jungle, garage-rap circa 2000)-- is the focus. The point isnt to disconnect from the body, but to train the mind to match the speed of thought with the deceptively high BPMs.\nAfter a cycle of cynicism, dark humor and despair, Rascal closes the album with \"Do It\", Boy in Da Corners answer to The Streets album-closer \"Stay Positive\". Simultaneously, its an apology for his antisocial behavior, a rallying cry, a confession, and a lucid realization that, despite his age, hes already reached the crossroads. His resistance worn, he admits that he wishes he could sleep forever: for days, for years, then \"for good,\" confessing that \"if I had the guts to end it all, I would.\" Like he often does throughout the record, Dizzee sounds as if the only thing nearly as bad as dying is having been born.\nDizzees despairing wail, focused anger, and cutting sonics place him on the front lines in the battle against a stultifying Britain, just as Johnny Rotten, Pete Townshend, and Morrissey have been in the past. The difference between the four (and their claims that \"Theres no future,\" \"I hope I die before I get old,\" \"I dont want to wake up on my own anymore,\" and \"I wish I could sleep forever\") isnt as different as it might appear on the surface: If Rascal grows at a similar rate, its not out of the question that he could leave a comparable legacy.",

        "article_text": "When I head out to purchase Hail to the Thief during my designated lunch break today-- an allowance Thom Yorke would surely turn into a fatalistic, Orwellian meditation on routine and alienation-- Ill mingle with teenagers and CEOs frantic to walk out with their own copy. Because today, Radiohead are U2, Pink Floyd, and Queen-- and they could have been bigger than The Beatles if the success of \"Creep\" hadnt agitated an Oxford-bred guilt complex. As Yorke put it in Meeting People Is Easy: \"English people arent impressed. Theres this automatic assumption that any degree of success means that youve cheated. Or youre full of shit.\"\nThats a cross Thom no longer has to bear, since whatever shit he was full of was beaten out of him-- in his hometown, no less-- one night in 2000. Like Johnny, the more thoroughly bloodied protagonist from Mike Leighs Naked, the assault lent Thom an appreciation of realitys ominous urgency, quite possibly for the first time. Protected from street-level human misery-- first by privilege, then by wit, later by celebrity-- Yorke labored for years under the misguided belief that the world is tangible, that it can be changed, that any dignified person would be miserable to live here. A mild pummeling at the hands of embittered local punters refocused this unparalleled modern songwriter on more immediate and emotionally resonant issues, stuffing him back in boots he was most certainly growing too big for.\nWhich is not to advocate violence, or suggest that any end could justify its employ, but there are tertiary benefits when an artists perspective is forcibly altered. Listen to Kid A, the most remarkably finessed redesign of an established bands sound since U2 recorded Achtung Baby: A reaction to overexposure, the undermining effects of commodification, and the alienation of celebrity, the record hasnt aged a day, though Amnesiac-- a less inspired collection of underdeveloped tunes from the same sessions-- has somewhat dulled its glimmer. The two albums were written and recorded before Thom was attacked, before he became a father, before the world became a lot smaller, when nothing really mattered. Hail to the Thief is almost four years removed from the reality he last wrote about, and for its suspicious title and Yorkes recent political exploits, its thankfully less concerned about third world debt and globalist conspiracy theories than Id expected. Still, the record is not without its simplistic admonitions.\nHail to the Thief doesnt dig up Britpop skeletons from The Bends, and its not OK Computer II, as Yorke christened it in the press. Rather, its a holding pattern; Yorke has confessed as much, and his excusatory remarks only underscore his chief failing: He believes radical change is the best option in all cases, and only feels pride in doing something \"new\" (quotes here, since Eno had ample reason to bristle at Kid A). Yorke cant see that Hail to the Thief is nothing to apologize for, that Radiohead are a band, and that, after a fashion, bands are defined by their music. Much as U2s Zooropa still sounded like U2, anything Radiohead does from here on out will sound like Radiohead.\nThe triumphant \"2 + 2 = 5\" could only work as the sets opener: Its an encompassing declaration of intent, defining the exploratory boundaries of Hail to the Thief as well as the professedly temporary return to \"rocking out,\" something Ed OBriens been wanting to do ever since Kid A was born. As a preface to headier analysis later in the record, Thom deals with his recent political distractions, pointing out the medieval ignorance of inaction in the face of overwhelming odds: \"Are you such a dreamer/ To put the world to rights?/ Ill stay home forever/ Where two and two always makes up five.\" Its a bit grandiose, but he rightly concedes the possible arrogance of his bravado during the tunes neurotically charged finale, \"Go and tell the king that the sky is falling in/ When its not/ Maybe not.\"\nNot as topical-- perhaps even reassuringly vague-- \"Sit Down. Stand Up.\" returns us to those old fears of impotence in the face of global forces at work, but as a new father, Thom has every right to revisit one of the great societal laments in rock history, OK Computer. Juxtaposing a dread spawned by media oversaturation with hands-over-ears denial of the rain falling outside, the track is devastating in its defeated isolation, the thoughts of a medicated droogie drooling in his cell on a Sunday afternoon, bubbling under the skin. Though its compositionally identical to \"2 + 2 = 5\", the darker subject matter and more sinister execution-- in the form of far-off piano melodies, icy xylophone hits and throttling vocal doubling-- reveal a demonic twin caught sideways in a cracked mirror.\nLeading with such an excellent couplet, its something of a disappointment to find that those reactionary barbs about stagnation Yorke is trying to defuse are critically valid, if irrelevant to fans. \"Sail to the Moon\" has the serenity to survive its lamentably tired title and refrain, but for its beauty, its both lyrically and melodically reconstituted from better ballads past, like \"Pyramid Song\", \"How to Disappear Completely\", and \"The Tourist\". For fans, its another wondrous lullaby from Radiohead; for critics, its not only nothing new, its topically ridiculous, as Thom cautions his newborn son: \"Maybe youll be president/ But know right from wrong/ Or in the flood/ Youll build an Ark/ And sail us to the moon.\" Its an apocalyptic vision with all the emotional impact of Steven Spielbergs A.I.\n\"Backdrifts\" is the first beacon signaling that Radiohead havent lost touch with the experimental nature of Kid A and Amnesiac. This carefully attended piece-- a boxed-in, minimal collection of sine waves, gurgling vocal delay and distorted drum machine loops-- is easily overlooked on first listen; in a moment of levity, the band cuts loose with reverse-echoed piano and guitar swipes done up as scratching vinyl. \"Go to Sleep\", a tightened retread of Amnesiacs Smiths tribute \"Knives Out\", drapes Morricone reverb and Perkins twang over hugely panned acoustic guitars. The tune carries through a surprisingly traditional half-time Britpop chorus as Yorke rambles through placeholder lyrics, alternating tossed-off lines like, \"We dont want the loonies taking over,\" with the constant response, \"Over my dead body.\"\nThis worrisome middling leads into \"Where I End and You Begin\", which is the only real low point on the album, as aside from Yorkes vocals, its simply a U2 song. Shuffling snare rolls usher along an admittedly succulent liquid bassline, but these are only drawn out from their terrestrial locus by a hard-panned pair of keyboard tracks, which, for their simplicity, rescue an otherwise unsalvageable track. The finale is more intriguing, with its raspy whispers and excellent melodic interplay, but for the most part, this is chaos stacked high to mask creative nudity underneath.\n\"We Suck Young Blood\" returns to the piano mode the band has explored increasingly since Kid A, a sort of drunken New Orleans death dirge that embodies its vampiric title, creeping along at a measured, sickly pace punctuated only by languid, distanced handclaps. The approach pays off hugely, as Yorkes gorgeous, metallic whinny embraces the stumbling progression with harmony after harmony, and moments of depressed, gentle wistfulness.\nAlong with \"Backdrifts\", \"The Gloaming\" exposes the bands potential future. Simple, looping glitches and obstinate digital blurts dash all expectations, remaining resolutely compact, borrowing huge synthetic reverb plates such that Yorke can sing over his own voice. Its arguably academic in its basic composition-- a theoretical dare-- but \"The Gloaming\" is one of few risks on this relatively sociable record, a wink to the more studious members of their audience.\nWhich is where the advance single \"There There\" picks up, embodying the unification of Radioheads recently mixed aims. Jonny wants to play with analog synths, Ed and Colin want to bash guitars, Thom wants to change music forever, and they finally meet up in this terrifically strange, yet structurally straightforward anthem. \"There There\" builds on more universal lyrics, soaring harmonies and a thundering crescendo the band wisely trimmed from its concert length (it originally began after Yorkes midpoint scream). Yorke said he wept uncontrollably when he heard the first mix of it, and the unmastered MP3s of Hail to the Thief which leaked in March support his professed reaction: Unlike the rest of the album, \"There There\" is essentially unchanged.\nPossibly even more inspiring (and enduring) are \"Myxomatosis\" and \"A Wolf at the Door\", two of the last tracks on the album. The former is a buzzing prog redux of OK Computers \"Airbag\" that shows how the simplicity Radiohead strive for can work wonders with tempo; drums fall all over the track until Thom winds up a layered, head-spinning (intoxicated?) verse that spills the rhythm onto the floor. Its a dizzying stereo-panned stomp, and one of Hail to the Thiefs finest moments.\nAs usual, Radiohead save a masterstroke for the closing slot: \"A Wolf at the Door\" continues in the peculiarly Slavic jazz-blues mode first explored in Amnesiacs Russo-Bayou parlor waltz \"Life in a Glasshouse\". But \"A Wolf at the Door\" is more thorough, refined and consequently potent-- almost slick-- in comparison with its drunken, ephemeral predecessor. Its here, at the end of things, that Yorke most openly deals with the impact of his physical assault three years ago and his still-maddening fears of role-playing traps in society and relationships (nicely summarized in a quick nod to Bryan Forbes terrifying The Stepford Wives). Evil is out there-- hes suffered its wrath-- and like a terrified Chechnyan matriarch, he relies on tangible protection from the fuckers and future come to ransom his child.\nFor its moments of gravity and excellence, Hail to the Thief is an arrow, pointing toward the clearly darker, more frenetic territory the band have up to now only poked at curiously. Experimentation fueled the creativity that gave us Kid A and Amnesiac, but thats old hat to Radiohead, who are trying-- and largely succeeding-- in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be. Without succumbing to dilettantism, they continue to absorb and refract simpler posits from the underground, ideas that are usually satisfied to wallow in their mere novelty. The syncretic mania of Radiohead continues unabated, and though Hail to the Thief will likely fade into their catalog as a slight placeholder once their promissory transformation is complete, most of us will long cherish the view from this bridge.",

        "article_text": "\"Where the fuck is my guitar?\"\nLil Wayne is a terrible guitarist. Just incredibly bad. The fact was evident at this years Summer Jam, when he spent two and a half interminable minutes noodling and crooning all by his lonesome while a stadium full of New Yorks most devout hip-hop fans looked on bewildered. \"Is he really playing the guitar right now?\" giggled a teenage girl. \"Thats not a chord or anything!\" Still, she recorded Wayne in all his tatted-up Tracy Chapman glory for YouTube posterity just the same. While everyone else on the days bill-- from Alicia Keys to Kanye West-- filled their shortened, festival-style sets with hits and finely-tailored theatrics, the audiences most anticipated act took the opportunity get his Guitar for Dummies on; Lil Wayne is, as he likes to say, \"different.\" Always has been.\nEarmarked as a gifted elementary school student in New Orleans, he became the token prodigy of his hometowns Cash Money clique at the age of 16, spitting pipsqueak gangsterisms over skittering Mannie Fresh beats. And, opposed to the typical rap flame-out trajectory, Wayne got better-- and stranger-- with each album. Now, nine years after his first solo LP, and on the heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, we get Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities. This is Waynes moment and he embraces it on his own terms. Instead of hiding his bootleg-bred quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package thats as weird as it wants to be; he eventually finds his guitar but keeps the strumming in check.\n\"I pay my dues, you keep the difference.\"\nAs the major music industry continues to wheeze and splinter, Lil Waynes spitball marketing plan for C3 is an unprecedented masterstroke. Over the past couple of years, hes given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona, voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC-- his output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds. And while stellar tapes like Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 offered-up plenty of hidden darts for sun-deprived message board nerds, his Just Say Yes policy toward any and all guest invitations (Enrique Iglesias? Why not!) provided maximum visibility and chiseled his radio-friendly chops. Piggybacking on hits by Chris Brown and Lloyd undoubtedly did wonders for his giggling teenage girl fan base, but a lesser-known assist appears to have had an even bigger effect on the new record.\n\"Gotta work everyday/ Gotta not be cliché/ Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.\"\nOne of the few satisfying tracks on OutKasts bungled Idlewild album was a woozy bitchfest called \"Hollywood Divorce\" featuring Lil Wayne. In hindsight, the invite feels like an act of sanctification. The songs a lesson in winning idiosyncrasies-- Andre, Big Boi, and Wayne are all salty, but they make sure to side-step pessimism (Big Boi deems rumor mongers \"M\u0026Ms with no nuts\"). Traces of the Souths most genre-bursting, P-Funk-worshipping ATLiens can be heard all over C3, from Waynes staccato phrasing on \"Mr. Carter\" to the extraterrestrial fetishism of \"Phone Home\" to the eclectic unpredictability of it all. The musical open-mindedness also lifts C3 above regional niches-- the #1 hit \"Lollipop\" sounds more like it was born on Jupiter than anywhere on earth. While Wayne isnt quite ready to produce something like \"Hey Ya!\", dont be shocked if you see him held up by a pair of leprechaun suspenders in the not-so-distant future.\n\"Ive done it before, please dont make me do it no more.\"\nC3 is Waynes most absurd album to date but its also his most personal. \"Shoot Me Down\", with its \"Lose Yourself\"-style guitar chug and ominous hook, has the rapper looking all the way back to age 12, when he accidentally shot himself with a .44 Magnum while toying with the gun in a mirror. \"Two more inches Id have been in that casket/ According to the doctor I couldve died in traffic,\" he rhymes on \"3 Peat\", possibly referring to the day in 2001 when a disgruntled groupie shot at his tour bus, planting a bullet in his chest. Such details add even more gravitas to his grizzled, elastic timbre, which suggests an impossibly hoarse (and high) David Ruffin at times. \"All I ask is dont take our love for granted,\" sings a perfectly sympathetic Babyface alongside Wayne on the lush ballad \"Comfortable\", the line coming off more like a saucer-eyed plea than a threat. And the LPs best track doubles as its most crazed and pained.\n\"Playing With Fire\" is a full-on faux-metal stunner that hearkens back to Bad Boys cinematic peak. On it, Wayne reaches Ghostface levels of paranoid distress: \"Im doin the same shit Martin Luther King did/ Checkin in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch/ Same balcony like assassinate me, bitch!\" His claims of MLK grandeur are far-fetched, but his impassioned delivery makes them seem more believable than one would think possible. Apparently, those Biggie and Pac references are getting to his codeine-addled brain-- after all, at 25, Wayne is now older than both legends were when they were gunned down. The implicit danger of carrying on such a legacy only adds to the rappers dramatic reading, and his anguish burns as hot as his punchlines.\n\"I think everybody gonna like this one...I got one!\"\nConsidering his running-faucet leak rate, there are bound to be fanboy quibbles about the intricacies of C3s tracklist (e.g., the buoyant web gem \"La La La\" should replace \"La La\" and its braindead Busta Rhymes verse, and what about the hazy \"I Feel Like Dying\" or the promising speed-soul track \"3 a.m.\"?). But considering there are probably several hard drives stuffed with syrupy odes featuring Waynes dubious auto-tuned howl, the final tally is exquisitely balanced and considered. After dozens of listens, the records overflowing minutiae-- from Fabulous and Juelz Santanas overachieving cameos to Waynes hilariously apropos kinship with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage-- still feels limitless. Just as the records cover playfully skews the Ready to Die/Illmatic baby-picture formula with Photoshopped tattoos, Wayne updates what it means to be the best rapper alive here. Gangster dandy. Fender-slinging sex god. Intergalactic prankster. Its all in him.",

        "article_text": "In 1976, Marvin Gaye holed up in his Hollywood studio and began recording Here, My Dear, a brutally candid album-length dissection of his divorce from wife Anna Gordy. The soul great found beauty within the wreckage, and the album doubled as an emotional exorcism that pushed out pain, anger, regret, spite, vengeance. \"Memories haunt you all the time/ I will never leave your mind,\" he threatens on a song called \"When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You\". Reviewing the album upon its release in 1978, critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"Because Gayes self-involvement is so open and unmediated... it retains unusual documentary charm.\"\nThe same could be said of Drake, whose unrepentant navel-gazing and obsession with lost love reach new levels on his second proper LP, Take Care. Running with Gayes ghost, Drake offers a profane update of his forebears twisted heart: \"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad/ I know you still think about the times we had,\" he sings on the insidious hook of \"Marvins Room\", a song recorded in the same studio where Gaye originally exposed his own unedited thoughts more than three decades ago.\nIn this age of reality television, 24-hour celebrity news, and second-to-second documentation-- where behind-the-scenes sagas mix with whats on screen and on record, creating an ever-morphing, ever-more-self-aware new normal-- Drake is an apt avatar. Naturally, he knows this, too. \"They take the greats from the past and compare us/ I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era,\" he contemplates on the album, \"In a time where its recreation/ To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations.\" We can thank Kanye West for legitimately kicking off this open-book hip-hop era, and its increasingly apparent that Drake is the most engaging new rap star since Ye. While fame causes some to withdraw and cling to what little privacy they have left, this 25-year-old Canadians penchant for poetic oversharing has only been emboldened by his success. When hes not making the most epic drunk-dial song in pop history with \"Marvins Room\", hes openly pleading with former flame Rihanna on the records title track, or duetting with Twitter wife Nicki Minaj on \"Make Me Proud\" only to call out such publicity-baiting \"relationships\" two tracks later, where he raps, \"It look like we in love, but only on camera.\" With its startlingly frank talk and endless heartbreak, Take Care often reads like a string of especially vulnerable-- and sometimes embarrassing-- Missed Connections.\nThis time around, Drake has a better grasp on his own notoriety and the mind-fucks that come with it. While he expressed wonderfully wounded trepidations about his sudden rise on Thank Me Later, hes learning to embrace it more here. \"They say more money more problems, my nigga, dont believe it,\" he raps on closer \"The Ride\". \"I mean, sure, theres some bills and taxes Im still evading/ But I blew six million on myself, and I feel amazing.\" And on \"HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)\", he all but gives away his hand, turning his sadness into strategy: \"What have I learned since getting richer?/ I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures.\" And while he claims \"I think I like who Im becoming\" on \"Crew Love\"-- about as ringing an endorsement youll get from a guy so bent on exposing his own disappointments-- hes still more interested in contradiction than triumph. Even when staring at a pair of unnatural breasts, he highlights the incision rather than the size: \"Brand new girl and she still growing/ Brand new titties, stitches still showing/ Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good/ Im bout to fuck and Im just praying that it feels good.\"\nJust as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up. Thank Me Later banked on a sonic tableau that was slow and sensual and dark-- equal parts Aaliyah and the xx-- and Take Care takes that aesthetic to an even more rewarding place, spearheaded by Drakes go-to producer Noah \"40\" Shebib, who gets a writing and production credit on almost every song. While the bombastic style of producer Lex Lugers work with Rick Ross and Waka Flocka Flame threatened to turn the tide on Drake and 40s moody atmospherics last summer, the pair stick to their gut here and delve further into smooth piano and muffled drums, fully committed to the idea of doing more with less. This is sensuous music that breathes heavy somewhere between UGKs deep funk, quiet-storm 90s R\u0026B, and James Blake-inspired minimalism. (Drake reportedly had a vinyl copy of Blakes debut LP on display in the studio while recording Take Care.) Its subtlety is a direct rebuke to the rash of in-the-red Eurotrance waveforms clogging up radio dials. Even the more upbeat tracks take pains not to rely on a simple thump. \"Take Care\" features Rihanna and a four-four beat, but the singer shows off her little-heard whispering delivery and the instrumental comes courtesy of the xxs Jamie xx, who nimbly tailors his remix of Gil Scott-Herons \"Ill Take Care of You\" for the occasion.\nDrakes worked on his own technical abilities, too, and both his rapping and singing are better than ever here. Notably, he only brandishes the hashtag flow he quickly became famous (or infamous) for over the last few years, turning it into a knowing knock on copycats: \"Man, all of your flows bore me/ Paint drying.\" And he breathlessly runs through the opening verse on the vicious \"HYFR\" at a speed that would likely garner respect from Busta Rhymes. And then theres \"Doing It Wrong\", a brilliant, barely there slow jam that borrows some lyrics from an unlikely source (Don \"American Pie\" McLeans twangy 1977 track \"The Wrong Thing to Do\") and features an unlikely guest in Stevie Wonder. Fitting the albums classy, unshowy demeanor, Wonder is tapped not to sing but play harmonica-- and uncharacteristically downcast harmonica at that-- for the tracks crushing denouement. The song has Drake chronicling the conflicting emotions of a difficult breakup and giving us his finest singing to date. His words are simple, universal, true: \"We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together/ But we sure make it feel like were together/ Cause were scared to see each other with somebody else.\" Elsewhere, André 3000 references Adeles unimpeachable \"Someone Like You\" in one of the albums many well-placed guest verses; \"Doing It Wrong\" deserves to follow that song as pops next Great Heartbroken Ballad.\nThe cover of Take Care shows its star sitting at a table, dejected and surrounded by gold, like a hip-hop Midas. Considering some of the money-doesnt-buy-you-happiness sentiments inside, the picture is apropos enough. But its much too obvious to truly represent what Drake and his crew have done here. A better image would be the grainy, amateur photo he released with \"Marvins Room\" when he originally leaked it in June, which shows the rapper walking away from a group of private jets, his face obscured by a puff of smoke making its way up to an overcast sky. It lets his reality do the heavy lifting while Drake stands by, taking it all in.",

        "article_text": "Jens Lekman, the sample-happy Swedish singer-songwriter with the boyfriendable baritone, isnt an artist who changes much from record to record. On his second proper full-length, Night Falls Over Kortedala-- out in Sweden now, and in the U.S. on Secretly Canadian early next month-- Lekmans deadpan style of singing, sunny melodies, and wittily lovelorn lyrics are a lot like what hes been doing since 2004 debut LP When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog, and on the EPs compiled on 2005s Oh Youre So Silent Jens. \"So if you liked that, youll love this,\" Jonathan Richman once wrote. Lekman quotes the phrase on his blog.\nOn the other hand, Jens Lekman isnt quite Jens Lekman anymore. He logged out of MySpace for the last time in February, dissatisfied with the impersonality of the medium. The new Lekman is a 23-year-old American who so far has only one friend; he joins impostor Lekmans already populating Facebook and Friendster. The actual Lekman apparently finds something beautiful in these false copies of himself, and hes come to embrace them. \"Just like Ive lately embraced all the misinterpretations in the media,\" he explains, again on his blog.\nIt all goes to show: Pops true meaning is whatever we construct for it ourselves. Not just critics or obsessive music lovers, but you, me, and anyone to whom a song means anything. Lekmans stunning Night Falls Over Kortedala embraces this idea more fully than any release of the past few years-- more even than Girl Talk with his memory-pricking laptop references, Kanye West with his canny reuse of classic hooks from Curtis Mayfield and Daft Punk, or mash-up artists with their many one-trick tracks. Like the Avalanches if they sang their own tunes, Lekman borrows liberally from his memories and surroundings, then uses them to create a lush and romantic world worth misinterpreting again and again.\nIts a world set mostly within the confines of a Gothenburg, Sweden neighborhood called Kortedala. For this, Lekman has called the album a failure; hed intended to traverse more ambitious terrain. Whether through samples, stylistic appropriations, or simply lyrics, Kortedala is a globe-conquering record regardless. Its vinyl-crackling arrangements span the baroque pop of Scott Walker, the upbeat rhythms and bright harmonies of Northern soul, and the beach-party disco of fellow Swedish artists Air France, Studio, and the Tough Alliance. Along with wry, sometimes melancholic observations worthy of Richman or the Magnetic Fields Stephin Merritt, these elements make for Lekmans best record, one likely to captivate even those who were skeptical of his previous releases.\nThe new album introduces Lekman draped in timpani, strings, and horns on \"And I Remember Every Kiss\", which samples classical violinist (and gatefold-sleeve inventor) Enoch Light. While recalling late-1960s Walker, the majestic opening also picks up where the Blueboy-sampled orchestration of When I Said... finale \"A Higher Power\" left off. \"I would never kiss anyone/ Who doesnt burn me like the sun,\" Lekman proclaims here. A track later, though, he admits to sometimes nearly regretting his first kiss: \"I see myself on my deathbed, saying, I wish I would have loved less.\" But thats when Willie Rosarios orchestral cover of Jimmy Webbs \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\"-- also used by the Avalanches-- hits, in all its blissful glory. Love can lead to anguish and shame, but in \"Sipping on the Sweet Nectar\", the feeling is worth it.\nWith that, the voyage begins. Current single \"The Opposite of Hallelujah\" visits 1960s Motown by way of Glasgow chamber-pop; beats sampled from the Tough Alliance take the harp-twinkled melancholy of \"Im Leaving You Because I Dont Love You\" to a club in the tropics. \"Shirin\" brings up the Iraq war as fact, not just political issue; it tells of an immigrant hairdresser at Kortedala Beauty Center (also the name of Lekmans home studio). On the slower \"It Was a Strange Time in My Life\", a portrait of the artist as a shy and self-loathing young man, a sample of an infant Lekman leads flute and chiming electric guitar into the not-so-distant past. \"I had a good time at the party when everyone had left,\" Lekman sings; throughout the album, backing vocals by El Perro del Mars Sarah Assbring and Frida Hyvönen ensure his loneliness never overwhelms his charms.\nAnd these are considerable. If rocknroll is \"the art of making the commonplace revelatory\", as critic Greil Marcus once wrote, this fey crooner is a rocknroller on par with the Streets Mike Skinner. Lekman can sing about asthma inhalers, avocados, and a heart \"beating like Ringo\"; on the aching standout \"A Postcard to Nina\", he describes an awkward conversation with a girls stern father who makes clumsy jokes about lie detectors. All of it works. Over sampled a cappella doowop on \"Kanske Ar Jag Kar I Dig\" (Swedish for \"Maybe Im In Love With You\"), Lekman just rambles for a while about something stupid he saw on TV. \"This has of course nothing to do with anything/ I just get so nervous when talking with you,\" he finally admits.\nThough not twee exactly, Kortedala may require an appetite for schmaltz-- another way Lekman makes \"the commonplace revelatory.\" If his Four Seasons falsetto on \"Shirin\" sounds suddenly chic thanks to this years great Pilooski re-edit of Frankie Vallis \"Beggin\", then the unabashedly sentimental \"Your Arms Around Me\" might be the stumbling block for some listeners. (Its ukulele riff has already been compared to Hansons \"MMMBop\".) It really doesnt matter; based on the Situationist concept of détournement, Lekmans song about an unfortunate kitchen mishap is a subversion of any bland source material. Besides, none of us can escape whats least cool about our past-- no matter what influences we list on our MySpace pages, it all informs our experience of pop. Or I could just be misinterpreting again.\nAdmittedly, no individual moment here quite rises to the heights of early single \"Maple Leaves\", which hinged on a mistake of its own: \"She said that we were just make believe, but I thought she said maple leaves.\" As an album, however, Kortedala represents the most cohesive statement yet from an immensely talented artist whose early EPs once made him seem like a rebel against the LP form altogether. Like the Renaldo \u0026 the Loaf-sampling \"Into Eternity\", its a record about moments (and kisses) we take with us-- moments that we (or Lekman) may never have experienced: Our own Kortedala.\nSo, is \"Shirin\" the true story of Lekmans hairdresser? Is jaunty \"Friday Night at the Drive-in Bingo\" really inspired by Lekmans time working what hes described as \"the shittiest job in the world\"? Did he even actually give up MySpace for good? Lekman takes great records down from their pedestal and reuses them in his art; it could be that he shows as little undue reverence for the facts of his own biography. Lekman follows an admonition from the Tough Alliance song sampled here, which they in turn lifted from 1980s UK left-wing skinhead band the Redskins: \"Take no heroes, only inspiration.\" I cant wait until someone rips off this album.",

        "article_text": "Before summer 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg was best known as the daughter of gallic godhead Serge Gainsbourg, a curiously magnetic actress with a diverse CV (romantic comedies, dark dramas, period pieces), and a part-time singer still working in the shadow of a mildly pedophilic 1984 duet recorded with her father called \"Lemon Incest\". Then Charlotte Gainsbourg nearly died. Weeks after a minor water skiing accident, she went to the doctor with headaches only to learn her hemorrhaged head was filled with blood.\nAfter summer 2007 (and successful brain surgery), the actress-singer filmed three intense movies including Lars von Triers frightful Antichrist, in which she plays a grieving mother who wanders around an isolated cabin without pants on before mutilating her genitals. She also recorded IRM, a decidedly more palatable post-trauma piece. Written, arranged, produced, and largely played by Beck, the collaborative album marks Gainsbourgs transition from pop scion to pop artiste.Gainsbourgs mother, singer and actress Jane Birkin, often played muse for Serge, whether she was cover star of 1971s Histoire de Melody Nelson or making orgasmic sounds on the hit duet \"Je taime...moi non plus\". And while IRM is marked by Becks singular sonic accoutrements, it often plays as if Charlotte is using him for inspiration. The muse-y confusion is both sensible-- Beck interpolated Serges \"Melody\" on Sea Change-- and oddly fated.\nBecks always had a cocked eye on death (remember that roaming pine box in the \"Loser\" video?) and his last three albums have focused on the ultimate end with unwavering abstract paranoia. If hes not sending up \"Profanity Prayers\" on Modern Guilt, hes seeing \"Strange Apparitions\" on The Information; as far as I know Beck did not have a near-death experience sometime around 2003, but hes been obsessed with poking at his forsaken soul ever since. Flip to Charlotte-- who became so haunted by her death scare that she underwent several MRIs (or IRMs, as the French call them) even after fully recovering-- and youve got a meeting of almost-40-year-old minds bent on exploring all the fears, mysteries, and anxieties that make death breathe. Theres something to Gainsbourgs skeleton-like visage on the albums cover.\n\"Heaven can wait and hells too far to go/ Somewhere between what you need and what you know,\" sing the pair on duet \"Heaven Can Wait\". The purgatory set up in those words informs the albums lyrics and mood, which live up to Becks more ominous and serious guise. Whereas it can sometimes sound like Becks already halfway into his crypt on his own songs, Gainsbourg is defiant, warm, and stoic in the face of flatlines. What could be depressing turns into a whimsical shrug on \"In the End\"-- \"Whos to say its all for the best in the end?\" hums Gainsbourg, comfortable in the unknowing. And on \"Masters Hands\", shes anything but helpless in the face of an Almighty Creator as she demands, \"Breathe out, come alive/ Give me a reason to feel.\" Shes in control, even when shes not.\nTheres nothing close to a love song here, a severe turnaround from Gainsbourgs Air-produced, Jarvis Cocker-written 2006 LP 5:55, which was full of sordid, shrouded, and oddly lifeless tales of crumbling hearts. But the thematic switch goes lengths to give Gainsbourg her own identity apart from her amorous lineage. The closest thing to a Valentines Day ode is found on the incubated folk tune \"Me and Jane Doe\". \"If I had my way Id cross the desert to the sea/ Learn to speak in tongues, something that makes sense to you and to me,\" she sings, longingly.\nAnother reason to believe IRM is more than a highly accomplished puppet job: Its actually better than any album Beck himself has released in the last seven years. The nods to psych rock, junkyard blues, half-rap cadences, and ghostly ballads wont shock anyone generally familiar with Becks oeuvre, but Gainsbourgs versatile and vulnerable vocals add a depth missing from much of her songwriters post-Sea Change work.\nShe makes the most of her limited vocal abilities by switching deliveries to match her surroundings. The barely there orchestral stunner \"Vanities\" (arranged by Becks dad David Campbell) gets a hushed quiver, the stream-of-consciousness brain-scan rock of \"IRM\" gets a zen rap, and, on the half-French closer \"La Collectionneuse\", she whispers close to your ear like a sultry grim reaper. The subject matter subverts her inherent sensuousness, but this is still Charlotte Gainsbourg singing-- at times, she cant help sounding like the cooing French goddess her father helped popularize. Its dead sexy, reborn.",

        "article_text": "Andy Stott must thrive in limbo. For much of the last decade, the Manchester producer shifted restlessly between varied electronic niches. He darted from spartan techno to luxuriating dub and so on, releasing singles with the enthusiasm of a keen listener trying to stake his own artistic identity. In 2011, he claimed that place with unapologetic if muted audacity, issuing two immersive EPs within four months. Passed Me By and We Stay Together flooded his self-made world of gray sounds and surface static with beats that, in retrospect, he seemed to have spent years learning and bending to his will. The deep house thuds of \"Cherry Eye\", the footwork splendor of \"North to South\", the slow-motion stutters of \"Execution\": They all cohabitated within Stott’s new twilit mode.\nThe addition of Alison Skidmore’s clarion vocals and Stott’s evermore-aggressive rhythms only enhanced the ghostly environment of the masterful 2012 LP, Luxury Problems. Mixing field recordings, vocal takes, and an assortment of technical processes, Stott operated both inside an uncanny valley and within its inverse, making the artificial seem natural and the alien seem familiar. After more than a dozen releases, Stott could now call an approach—a liminal state of the human and inhuman, of the driving and the drifting—his own.\nOn Faith in Strangers, Stott’s first substantive solo release since Luxury Problems, he applies that kilned aesthetic to an expanding set of sounds and ideas. If that 2011–2012 trilogy found Stott codifying his style, Faith in Strangers is his attempt to stretch it by piggybacking that recent system onto his early adventurousness. It’s a bold move, one made with a new vote of public valediction. Luxury Problems, for instance, began with its most instant hook. Her voice wrapped in a lacework of effects, Skidmore seductively repeated \"touch\" until Stott’s shuddering beat fell in behind her. But Faith in Strangers starts with something that belongs more on the landmark sound-art label Touch. \"Time Away\" opens in silence, or at least the room tone of a field recording. A horn slowly intones one note, which decays against a bed of quiet and creepy field recordings. It’s as though Stott’s world breathed in the long-tone pieces of minimalist composer Yoshi Wada and exhaled them through his trademark filter of glitches, pops, and hazes.\nSkidmore’s voice arrives for the second track, the stunning \"Violence\", but it’s reversed and filtered, pieces of her syllables simply cut off at the root. \"Clap your hands/ clap your hands,\" she sings as though to tease an audience about a beat that, nearly nine minutes into the album, has yet to arrive. When at last it does, the pulse is one of the most forceful of Stott’s catalogue, the shuddering bass and snare snaps suggesting that the producer has now welcomed trap into his vocabulary, too. But it’s damaged and distorted in much the same way as all Stott sounds. He pulls new influences into his fold without allowing them to push him outside of his preordained spheres—a nightclub built with pillows and wired with headphones, or a narcotics den affixed with mirror balls and strobe lights.\nFaith in Strangers starts soft and light, only to have Stott gradually amplify the energy across its 54 minutes. By the time the record enters its second half, it’s climbed from half-graceful, half-spectral footwork to minimal rhythms rattled by enormous bass and lurid synths. And then, on \"No Surrender\", an organ run that suggests the house music at Timothy Leary’s Daheim Castle introduces a catastrophic beat. The kick pounds and snares pop through a sheet of static, moving as if they’ve ruptured every speaker system upon initial impact. Stott applies that distortion to the splintered IDM of \"How It Was\" and, most tellingly, to the remarkable \"Damage\".\nThe meat of that aptly named number is an enormous, bass-backed melody, the exact sort of chirping hulk that turned TNGHT into a set of five adrenaline injections. For Stott, though, it’s just another plaything, an element to drag into his mix. He lets the hook blow out until it’s degraded into low fidelity, and he surrounds it on all sides with caustic noise. The harsh cymbal splashes at the start recall a Max Neuhaus experiment with drums, the clipped ending the manic cut-ups of Hrvatski. \"Damage\" is the shortest and most magnetic song on Faith in Strangers, Stott’s real shot at a legitimate single. But he rejects the notion wholesale, as though boasting that the rubric he’s rendered simply won’t allow something so straight.\nIn the last three years, Stott has not only cemented his approach but also upped his ambition, moving from a producer who made disjointed singles to a musician hoping to craft albums with unspoken narrative action. \"It sounds cliché to say a ‘journey,’ but it’s got to be a story in some sense,\" he told Tiny Mix Tapes of this LP. \"It does intensify from start to finish.\" At this point, actually pulling that off remains Stott’s main challenge. Despite his increasingly disciplined and unified technique, Faith in Strangers can feel disorganized when taken as a whole. The intended arc from invitation toward aggression occssionally scans more as zigs and zags between a few distinct suites. Still, the separate moments are astounding, evidence of a musician who has managed to remain inquisitive even as he’s established his signature.",

        "article_text": "Nas has been disappointing people nearly half his life. By now, the passion play of raised and swiftly dashed hopes that occurs whenever he announces a new album has repeated itself enough times to officially qualify as farce. Youd think hed be exhausted by now, and there were times over his last three sleepwalking efforts when he sounded just that: a guy wearily familiar with his own towering mythology, and increasingly disinterested in living up to it.\nBut what if Nas stopped fretting about blowing peoples minds or disappointing them and just, you know, made a record? Its the kind of question Nas devotees have spent years pondering, and Life Is Good, his 10th studio album and strongest in three or four presidential administrations, is basically the answer. Song for song, its his most solid, disaster-free album since, well... we wont go there, as comparing Nas albums is like comparing birthdays where your father showed up late instead of not at all. But for once, Nas sidesteps oblivion. Life Is Good finds him avoiding most of his worst impulses, scraping the pseudo-mystical Righteous Teacher patina off his crown and touching back down in the Queensbridge of his sense memory over late-summer-light production.\nLife Is Good is so consistent, in fact, that its disorienting, and those of us with a long history navigating Nas albums will have a lot of pressing questions: What are all these top-shelf beats doing here? Where are the queasy sex jams, the songs rapped from the perspective of heroin spoons or discarded E\u0026J bottles, the choruses about being a Warrior and a Hero? Where is the blindingly ill-fitting Nas Radio Bid? (The lone example, the Swizz Beatz-produced \"Summer on Smash\", is just inoffensively generic.) But above all: What happened this time?\nPart of the answer is clear. The last few years have been turbulent ones in Nas personal life -- his brutally public split with Kelis, the costly settlement, the embarrassing fiasco with his teenage daughter tweeting pictures of a bejeweled box of condoms in her bedroom. Historically at his best when shaken, Nas has rich material to work with here, and hes more open-hearted on Life Is Good than he has been since Gods Son. \"Daughters\", his sweetly reflective response to the condom-gate that is no less sweet for its slight lyrical awkwardness (he refers to what is presumably Twitter just as \"the social network\"), finds him examining the responsibilities of fatherhood with fond bewilderment. The song aimed directly at Kelis (\"Bye Baby\"), meanwhile, is more a good-times remembrance than score-settling. \"You screamin at the racist cops in Miami was probably the highlight of my life,\" he recalls, the affection audible in his voice.\nIts also entirely possible that Nas fans have No I.D. to thank for Life Is Goods quality. In the recent Complex cover story on Nas, I.D. said that he \"wanted to make a soundtrack that allowed Nas to be Nas.\" Mentor to Kanye, a Chicago rap veteran, and the current executive vice president at Def Jam, No I.D. seems to be cementing his role as the Rap Whisperer: He recently guided a deeply confused Common to his first good record in nine years, and its likely he exercised some of the same gentle-but-firm guidance here. He produces five of 14 tracks on Life is Good, and they all exude the warm TV-fireplace crackle of the best throwback production. You can feel the July city-heat sweat drip off the wooly saxophone on \"Stay\", while \"Back When\" flickers like a dim neon sign. The lyrics to \"Back When\" dont even do much besides gesture at Nas musty mythology: \"check out the oracle bred by city housing,\" Hollis Ave, Shan, and Marley, \"you love to hear the story of how it all got started,\" etc. But he breathes through it with old-Shakespearean-actor fondness-- he was, after all, there, and No I.D. provides just the right lighting.\nThe rest of the production list reads as if it were crowd-sourced by exacting Nas purists: Buckwild, Salaam Remi, the late Heavy D (who gave Nas \"The Don\" before he passed away). Remis blaring beat for \"A Queens Story\" is like a louder, more dramatic version of \"Get Down\", its tension ratcheted up by James Bond-theme horn blurts. There are a couple of playful, possibly shameless nods to Illmatic: On the intro to \"Loco-Motive\", a suspiciously familiar-sounding subway train rolls over tracks in the distance. Nas dedicates the song to \"my trapped in the 90s niggas,\" a line that could be used against him but that sounds, in the albums context, like playfulness. You cant recapture lightning in a bottle, or age backwards, but you can settle gracefully into strengths. Nas isnt back; hes just here.",

        "article_text": "Annie Clark, the musician otherwise known as St. Vincent, projects an aura of eerie perfection-- beautiful, poised, good-humored, and well-adjusted to a degree uncommon for rock performers, let alone ordinary people. Shes clearly not oblivious to her disarming qualities. On the covers of both her albums, her wide eyes and porcelain features give her the appearance of a cartoon princess come to life, and in the songs contained therein, she sings with the measured, patient tones of a benevolent, maternal authority figure. The thing that separates Clark from any number of earth mother Lilith Fair types, however, is her eagerness to subvert that effect. Her album covers may showcase her pretty face, but her blank expression and the tight framing leave the images feeling uncomfortably ambiguous. Her voice and arrangements are often mellow and soothing, but those sounds mainly serve as context as she exposes undercurrents of anxiety and discomfort hidden just beneath a gorgeous façade.\nThe songs on St. Vincents second album, Actor, are primarily sung from the perspective of women who feel stifled and restless in their safe, orderly lives. Her characters worry about the judgment of neighbors and strangers, struggle with boredom and complacency, attempt to sublimate or defuse their anger, and, in one of the records darkest selections, fantasize about disappearing completely into a new identity. Her lyrics are sympathetic observations rendered with clear, economical language focused on a specific moment of conflict or epiphany, occasionally undercut with self-deprecating asides and subtle humor. Even when the music is at its most dramatic, as when songs slip out of placid, Disney-esque string accompaniment into jagged, distorted guitar passages, Clark consistently understates her characters angst, and buries their negative emotions under layers of denial, stoicism, and subservience to the desire of others.\nThe sound of the recordings depict the nuances of these deliberately muted emotions with uncanny accuracy, but the result is not overly polite or unaffecting. On the contrary, Clarks compositions hone in on precise fluctuations in mood, and flesh out complex inner worlds for the women suggested in her lyrics. At some points, as in the climax of \"Black Rainbow\" and the groovy, robotic hysteria of \"Marrow\", she achieves a harrowing expression of panic and desperation, but she does just as well in conveying the tension and pressures within less bombastic numbers such as \"The Bed\" and \"Save Me From What I Want\". The latter, which takes its title from one of artist Jenny Holzers best-known aphorisms, is particularly successful in the way its faintest textural details communicate an unease at odds with its airy tone and steady beat.\nSince Clarks voice seldom strays from a calm, lovely tone, her guitar parts articulate much of the records anxieties and provide its moments of cathartic release. Her style is melodic and controlled, conjuring abrasive textures that nevertheless have a clean, meticulous quality that complements her immaculate arrangements as well as her characters temperate demeanor. Despite a reliance on processed tonality, she manages to avoid a sterile coldness, and has a way of performing her most tightly composed hooks with a touch of looseness and immediacy. In her heaviest, most warped riffs, Clark finds the grace in her subjects frustration and purges their fear and repressed anger with a glorious, singular noise.\nIn \"Actor Out of Work\", an atypically straightforward rock song early in the albums sequence, Clark uses the title phrase as a sad epithet for an inappropriate yet attractive suitor with an inability to lie convincingly. Acting, of course, is a lot more than just lying and pretending. Its about inhabiting characters, being able to fill in subtext with cadence and gesture, and having the empathy required to understand the motivations and actions of the person being portrayed. With that in mind, the album is perfectly titled, as Actor proves St. Vincent as an artist capable of crafting believable, complicated characters with compassion, insight, and exacting skill.",

        "article_text": "Whether its a reaction against the MP3s pending usurpation of the album format or just simple coincidence, the concept record is enjoying a small comeback at the moment. But perhaps careful not to echo the supposed sins of bloat and misbegotten puffery that characterized the psychedelic and progressive rock eras, many of the artists responsible for the best recent concept records-- Sufjan Stevens Greetings from Michigan, the Magnetic Fields i, and The Fiery Furnaces upcoming Blueberry Boat-- share a willful intimacy that borders on the quaint.\nOn A Grand Dont Come for Free-- the follow-up to his internationally acclaimed debut, Original Pirate Material-- Mike Skinner audaciously weaves an 11-track narrative over an often bare and inert musical backdrop, one that acts more like a film score than the foundation of a pop record. The plot is pretty bare-bones: boy loses money, boy meets girl, boy loses girl. But by focusing as much on the minutiae of life as on its grand gestures, the impact of Skinners album-- essentially a musical update of \"The Parable of the Lost Coin\" peppered with Seinfelds quotidian anxiety and, eventually, a philosophical examination of Skinners lifestyle and personal relationships-- transcends its seemingly simple tale.\nCynics and/or detractors could sneer that Skinners sonics are too slight and that his flow is too rigid-- particularly when compared to \"other\" hip-hop artists-- without being entirely off the mark: Skinners awkward, sometimes offbeat delivery is even more charmingly/frustratingly clumsy here than it was on Original Pirate Material, and the records beats and melodies are subservient to its story. But while those perceived weaknesses may make A Grand a non-starter for those who disliked Skinners debut, trying to place his square peg into the round holes of either hip-hop or grime/eski seems a mistake. After all, this is a record that starts with its protagonist trying to return a DVD and ends with him chastising himself for improperly washing his jeans. In between, he spends time at an Ibiza burger stand, smokes spliffs on his girlfriends couch, grumbles about a broken TV, sorts out his epilepsy pills, philosophizes about the nature of friendship, and grumbles about the failures of mobile technology. Clearly, Skinner is on a singular place on the pop landscape.\nEchoing his ability to compensate for his own musical weaknesses, Skinner manages to turn his characters personal shortcomings into A Grands strengths: Communication failures, both technological and human, allow Skinner to deftly examine body language and small gestures. His characters lack of prospects and disconnect with work and family highlight the importance of friendship (especially, perhaps, to young urban adults). His crippling self-doubt (at the records start, any hiccup in his day is proof that he should just spend it in bed) and need for approval from others makes his solipsistic epiphany all the more heart-wrenching. The albums ultimate contradiction may be that while Skinners life is seemingly driftless, his understandable attempt to tether it to another human being-- any other human being-- often causes him more harm than good.\nConsidering that Skinner showed such a gift for post-laddish humor on Original Pirate Material, the most surprising aspect of A Grand may be that, here, hes at his best when hes at his most sentimental. His love and/or relationship songs overflow with melancholy and the inability to express emotion at crucial moments. In short, theyre pretty truthful and sometimes painfully familiar. Along with the drug haze of \"Blinded by the Lights\", A Grands best moments are a pair of tracks that bookend the storys main boy/girl relationship: The first-date track \"Could Well Be In\" (\"I looked at my watch and realized right then that for three hours we been in conversation/ Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent and we carried on chatting for more than that again\") and the dissolution of that same relationship on \"Dry Your Eyes\", a tongue-tied, heart-in-throat ballet of non-verbal expression.\nThat Skinner is able to coax so much from a cliché-heavy, 50-minute examination of solipsism and self-pity is a tribute to his ability to reflect and illuminate lifes detail. By stressing his paranoia and doubts (\"Its hard enough to remember my opinions, never mind the reasons for them,\" he blubbers as he loses a domestic dispute), he deftly avoids the melodrama of todays network reality TV. Instead, his approach echoes the faux reality of The Office (which shares a non-ending ending with A Grand) and the me-first neediness of its \"star\" David Brent (whose final-episode self-actualization echoes Skinners). Like The Office, Skinners anthropological humanism typically focuses on either the mundane or disappointing-- and, lets face it, life is most often one or the other--- but he does so with such endearing intimacy and bare honesty that its easy to give yourself over to the albums narrative on first listen and, perhaps just as importantly, to want to revisit it over and over again.",

        "article_text": "Cut Copy are Australian, and its summer in Australia right now. So if it feels a little weird listening to an album of euphoric, starry-eyed dance-rock on earbuds while youre scraping snow-grit off your windshield, keep in mind: Somewhere in the world, someone is probably road-tripping to a swimming hole with this album playing, or eating a popsicle, or playing catch with their dogs while it blasts out of a car stereo or nearby boombox. By the time summer arrives for those of us in the northern hemisphere, well know these songs by heart and be able to sing along loudly.\nBack when this group released 2004s Bright Like Neon Love, the idea of backing dazed, introverted indie pop with a utopian house thump was still relatively novel. And though that sound has since inspired legions of followers and copycats, still no one does it quite like Cut Copy themselves. 2008s steamrolling In Ghost Colours was an album of anthems; tracks like \"Hearts on Fire\" and \"Lights and Music\" were transcendent pop that stuck in heads for days. But Zonoscope is something different. Its an album-album that puts serious work into movements and transitions, and it works best when you hear it all in one chunk. That doesnt mean its Cut Copys OK Computer; it just means that the group has put more work into building a vast, rolling landscape rather than a series of peaks.\nZonoscope opens with a blast of woozy ecstasy in the form of \"Need You Now\", the sort of track where you dont even realize how much tension the group has built up until they release it, and ends with \"Sun God\", a marathon 15-minute groove that slowly morphs into a tranced-out Giorgio Moroder thud. In between those two tracks, Cut Copy build a long-form piece of work that moves between genres and ideas and moods without ever sacrificing its dancefloor momentum.\n\"Take Me Over\" works in a bouncy hook from Fleetwood Macs mid-80s party-staple \"Everywhere\" and gives a sly nod to their countrymen Men at Work, turning down-moments into playful exercises in irresistible cheeseball melody. \"Where Im Going\" is a twinkly, faraway sigh of a song that could pass for Washed Out if it wasnt for the titanic Gary Glitter drum-stomp powering it. And \"Pharaohs \u0026 Pyramids\" may be the greatest thing here; it uses the bands melodic gifts and the sense of yearning in frontman Dan Whitfords voice and applies them to a classic Chicago house anthem, deploying its keyboard blips, synth-strings, and programmed cowbells at the exact right moments, building into a climactic cresting swoop.\nCompared to the last two albums, Zonoscope has precious little guitar crunch, which makes it hard to even call Cut Copy a dance-rock band anymore. And thats for the best-- not just because that combination seems like a less thrilling prospect in 2011 than perhaps it once did, but also because Cut Copy have the architecture of dance music down perfectly and the confidence to execute the genres moves with absolute precision. Even in the dead of winter, Zonoscope does its job beautifully. Imagine how itll sound when you dont have to layer up to go outside.",

        "article_text": "Marnie Stern cant sleep. Not well and not often, at least. Thats what she says. I didnt learn of her insomnia for months after In Advance of the Broken Arm was released last February. But in retrospect, it made sense: When I first heard her music, I couldnt sleep either.\nIn Advance opened with an eight-note guitar figure, cycled 32 times in half a minute-- about eight and a half notes a second. A brutal, highly repetitive pop song ensued. Marnie shrieked and trembled. Her rhythm section (Hellas Zach Hill) egged her on-- she juggled fire; he hosed her with gasoline to cool her off. She made hysteria sound hypnotic.\nWhat set her apart, though, wasnt showmanship, or even hooks-- it was her vulnerability. In a scene of bands that rely on technical prowess to sway fans-- or, if that doesnt work, beating the collective ass into ecstasy with noise-- Marnie Stern appealed to the heart. Her music didnt just aim to impress, but to move. For a couple of weeks, I thought of her as an emotive technician, but it became clear she was something else: A dizzy heir to Sleater-Kinney, or Helium-- arty, feminine guitar-rock that infiltrated Guyville without a mission statement.\nHer second albums title, This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It and That Is That isnt one you have to read more than once. But it sums Stern up. Its obsessive and choppy. Its playful. Its gleefully oblivious of when to shut up. But its obliviousness is crucial-- the music, like the title (a reference to the religious philosopher Alan Watts), implies a loop or a meditative void.\nShe still strikes Van Halen and AC/DC poses. Her guitar parts still crisscross and crosshatch, her vocals are still shrill, and both are overdubbed relentlessly. Hill still implies a groove without sparing his kit any violence, but not enough to actually sound like hes grooving, which would be anathema to music this wired. As a group, though, theres a new sense of self-assuredness. Shes learned when to flex and glint, and when to lean in the cut. \"The Crippled Jazzer\", \"The Package is Wrapped,\" and the album-closing \"The Devil Is in the Details\" get so comfortable they break into a strut-- a far cry from In Advance.\nIn a way, thats reassuring-- while energy is essential to her music, its not the only force at work. Itd be a shame to see her subsist solely on hammer-ons. But learning to relax and record in a real studio-- as opposed to her bedroom-- hasnt compromised Sterns singular talent: to make the work of one sound like the joy of many.\nIn Advance was an album primarily about how hard Stern had to push herself to make it. The lines read like they were collaged from self-help, pop-Buddhism, and sports memoir. She was a cheerleader possessed. The newfound musical openness on This Is It is mirrored in lyrics that seem to actually account for people other than herself. \"What I need now is a good feeling to let me know\"-- thats a promise. \"Im hoping its true/ Im hoping for you, you, you\"-- thats a declaration. By the time the album reaches \"The Devil Is in the Details\", its hard to imagine Stern as someone who quit her job to sweat over a portastudio in the middle of the night. \"The devil is in the details if you are ready,\" she challenges. She ends the album on a precipice, which, I guess, is how she should-- with miles to go before we sleep.",

        "article_text": "White Lung aren’t subtle—but then again, neither is the doorman who assumes every woman with a band is either a groupie or the merch girl. Nor is your average comments section in response to just about any article posted about a female artist. Nor are the standards of physical beauty, relationship dynamics, and personal happiness promulgated by pop culture. Nor is drug addiction. Nor is the #notallmen hashtag. Nor is questioning Sky Ferreira about how much her breasts are responsible for her success, nor are authorities liable to ask “what were you wearing” to every accuser of sexual assault. White Lung’s bracing third LP Deep Fantasy is a product of its environment, that environment being “the real world in 2014,” filled with people who refuse to be a part of the solution because they won’t even admit there’s a problem.\nSo, White Lung are not subtle. But Deep Fantasy is definitely savvy, ensuring its staunch ideals are delivered by a riveting, relatable frontwoman and 22 minutes of vicious, compact musicianship and addictive melody. It’s an uncompromising feminist punk record that can be grasped by anyone who finds themselves compelled by kickass rock music and basic human decency.\nThe importance of White Lung’s potential reach can’t be overstated. Formative influence Courtney Love has specifically expressed hope for White Lung to “achieve some kind of mainstream success”, noting, “It means there are more people listening, and youre affecting the zeitgeist more.” It’s hard to imagine a rock band of any kind to be allowed the platform that Hole, or even less commercially fortunate acts like L7 and Babes in Toyland, could have two decades ago. However, Deep Fantasy is being put out by the same people responsible for Animal Collective, Real Estate and Arctic Monkeys records.  In 2014, this is the equivalent of a major-label debut.\nThe result is a best case scenario retaining the accessibility that marked White Lung’s 2012 breakthrough Sorry, while amplifying the parts that translate to a bigger stage. Sorry producer Jesse Gander returns, and he did a pretty good job last time a long-overlooked Vancouver punk band had the opportunity to put everything on the line.  As on Japandroids’ Celebration Rock, the sound of Deep Fantasy is not slick so much as knife-like: piercing, bright, precise and forged under a great amount of pressure.\nAnd it leads with the sharpest part—opening duo “Drown With the Monster” and “Down it Goes” assumes you’ve never heard White Lung before, and theyre the best and hookiest demonstrations of what they do. These are doomed, minor-key dirges sped up to the point where they become anthemic, performed at the highest possible velocity where they can still qualify as potential pop. Anticipatory guitar roars are required to take off after Anne-Marie Vassilious held cymbal-crash introductions and they keep pace with a rigid, doubled-up hardcore rhythm and fill-free drumming. Mish Way often inverts typical song structure, hanging high notes perilously over sludgy, drop-D chords in the verse while she takes a lower, more menacing and tense register on the choruses. Guitarist Kenneth Williams uses technical precision for texture, as harmonics and high treble flicker like sparks from a buzzsaw against metal. \nIt’s thrilling, and White Lung don’t do much else from that point on. Even compared to 2014’s other high-profile, high-BPM, sub-half-hour feminist punk LP, Deep Fantasy is sonically blinkered—there are no ballads, no ambient noise instrumentals, and the few seconds of feedback that close the album is about as close as you get to “atmosphere.” White Lung does just about one thing musically on Deep Fantasy, but its one thing that no one else is doing right now. Though often positioned in the lineage of bands from a time when Lollapalooza was a traveling circus, White Lung are a modern creation, their kohl-streaked punk more Black Sails in the Sunset than Black Flag. Occasionally, the cohesion of Deep Fantasy can be taxing, but for the time being, this is the band taking their sound as far as it can go.\nWays lyrics can be just as condensed as the music itself, but theyre more like concentrate, expanding on contact and allowing the listener to come up with their own formulation. Considering \"Drown With the Monster\"s nasty snarl of a hook, some poor sap from an energy drink company might try to mindlessly co-opt it for a commercial, which is a tribute to how open-ended “Drown” is; Way struggles with an undefined addiction and never quite says whether she’s giving in, giving up, or giving herself another chance to fight. “Down It Goes” and “Snake Jaw” are likewise dense and comprehensive, touching on the threatening imbalance in sexual pursuit  (“You fear my thick skin/ I’m thinking there’s a knife”), dysmorphia (\"You drag me behind/ Like bitter squirming swine\"), body image (“If I get fat one day, will you run away?/ I’ll starve if you promise to save me”) and disordered eating (\"Here comes my dinner now/ Its for the win\").\nDeep Fantasy does work best as a multimedia affair; it almost certainly requires its lyric sheet to be understood, and Way’s outside writing supplements her work rather than disenfranchising the listener of their personal interpretation. At Deep Fantasys center, there’s one song that can be effectively heard as a straightforward demonstration of self-confidence, of friendship, of support. Way explained that it’s the one written as a reaction to rape culture, and it takes on a new, demolishing power upon the realization that its title is the last thing a sexual assault accuser is likely to hear—“I Believe You”.\nJust about every aspect of White Lung’s music is aggressive and sounds angry and invective, though “I Believe You” stresses the resonance and empathy; while Way’s philosophical and theoretical leanings might not be considered “mainstream,” it’s a compliment to Deep Fantasy to say that none of its calls for dignity, for humanity, for understanding sounds remotely radical—rather, they’re pretty fucking rational. Plenty of people with progressive tastes in politics and pop culture still could reasonably think “feminist punk” (or any political variant of any music) isn’t something they’d necessarily enjoy listening to, and while Hole sold millions of records, surely a great deal had access to their underlying message because they saw “Miss World” jammed between Live and Candlebox videos on MTV. This is principled music, not doctrine, and while inspired by its surroundings, it’s defined by its leader making bracing art. Deep Fantasy is a product of its environment, as well as one hell of a survival guide to live through this.",

        "article_text": "Up to now, Scott Herren-- the shy, lanky Atlantan responsible for Prefuse 73s fabulous glitch-hop debut Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives-- hasnt made his name as a purveyor of confessional music. The closest he ever came was the laptop catharsis of Delarosa and Asora, which had no secrets to tell; rather, its intricacies of meter and texture gave your head something to do while your guts spilled out over it. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was hard-edged and fast-cutting, immersed in early rap techniques and sensibilities; it didnt express feelings, it steamrolled them. But One Word Extinguisher shows a range of emotional grappling usually foreign to instrumental hip-hop. Its clear that Herren was coming back to the studio night after night not just for skills and thrills, but for a measure of solace. Make no mistake: This is a breakup record.\n\"The never-ending battle\" is what Herren calls the break-up that lasted for the year-plus during which this album was in production. \"I locked myself in my room working, disconnected the phone, bummed out as fuck,\" he told CMJ in March. \"You cant talk to anybody, you feel like shit, and its the only thing you have to express yourself.\" A year of unspeakable suffering channeled into sixty ripe minutes: In the hands of anyone else, it could be torture. This sorrow, however, sparks with a sweeping wail of queasy ahhhs that carry stunted hopes for a soon-to-be-doomed relationship. Vocal scraps and a blood-curdling scream announce the descent of the mask of hip-hop rage, as an eightfold synth-scribbling bomb drops right into \"The End of Biters\", the first of several sucker-punching cutfests in the illustrious tradition of the edit record. Next comes Diverses self-absorbed \"Plastic\", a screed that rails with righteous indignation against \"pop trends and predetermined top-tens.\" All this over-the-top rebuke is obviously an escape from something.\nThings begin to come into focus as \"Uprock and Invigorate\" bounces in with its edges exposed. Warm, fretless bass, flitting Rhodes, drizzling sawtooth, and a brittle snare become intent on stocking up and locking down with every passing bar. But beneath the surface lies a hint of tension between the percussive exoskeleton and its syrupy core, an orderly contest of soul-versus-machine that momentarily eclipses the sense of loss. The rest of the album projects this kind of tension into a giant battle of the sexes. \"The Color of Tempo\" mangles its feminine samples with a virile beatbox pattern; \"90% of My Mind Is with You\" breaks up heavy panting with a deliberately difficult, meter-defying beat, and ends with a series of mournful, defeated R\u0026B; samples. There can be no more doubt when, on \"Female Demands\", a girlfriendish voice casually tells Herren to \"fuck with the beat here\" only to be throttled by digital effects; the rest of the track feels like a giant damaged gynorcism. Before we know it, were desperately trying to forget her, bumping with another woman who croons \"you... you... you...\" on the offs.\nMeanwhile, straight meters are often sprinkled with triplet ligaments, propelling the beat with an uncommonly light touch. But Prefuses rhythmic sophistication isnt just about alternating threes and fours-- as the lesson goes, it takes two interlocked meters to make African music. While Herren rarely tries to stand up in two meters at once, he often relies on the juxtaposition of mildly divergent rhythmic feels within the same beat, proving his mastery of some of the subtler tensions available to the instrumentalist. This gives him access to some very subtle tensions-- though many tracks seem like tricks to distract us from the ongoing devastation. Sooner or later, it sinks in that were in the company of an emotional fugitive, sealed in a room with machines whose perfect control, he is convinced, will allow him to avoid the inevitable emotional reckoning. Through scorn and bombast, through distraction and self-parody, through the sheer weight of craft, this Prefuse tries to wear his sorrow down, to crush himself, to explode the emptiness. A thrilling listen, but how could such a mission succeed?\nIm not sure how he did it. Theres a glimmer of hope in the open restraint of \"Choking You\", a sawtooth shuffle scattered with chirpy, chalky bits. Another late track calls a gender truce, as a skeletal crunch frames some lightly doctored female vocals, giving a cold, sweet impression, like melon rinds left out in the rain. And the last track, in spite of its metric and sexual duplicity, offers a baffling promise of balance. Unexpectedly, the music becomes its own consolation.",

        "article_text": "The first song on Fall Be Kind, Animal Collectives new five-song EP, is called \"Graze\", and it starts with a colorful swirl of Disneyfied strings as Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) sings teasing lines like \"Let me begin\" and \"Let light in\" and \"Some ideas are brewing.\" The song seems to be partly about the struggle of creation-- grazing on the imagination, maybe-- and then Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) comes in with his thick, honeyed voice to sing a bridge that seems a distant cousin of the Beach Boys \"Dont Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\". Theres tension in this opening section; the words and music suggest a sticking point, something that needs to be punctured before the song (and ideas) can really flow. And then it happens, the break, but in an unexpected way: a peppy flute melody materializes and the rhythm becomes a kind of stomp that seems designed to inspire folk dancing, while Portner and Lennox pick up the tempo and start singing rounds: \"Why do you have to go?/ Why do you have to go?\"\nThe first time through, hearing \"Graze\" explode into this weird sing-along RenFaire jig is a bit of a shock. It sounds very far from what we imagine a hip, frequently name-checked indie band with abrasive experimental roots to sound like. And their performance of it is certainly not tongue-in-cheek: They sound joyful, and theyre not smirking. (Im not sure theyre capable of that particular expression, to be honest.) And thus it becomes clear that Animal Collective, despite having become a certain kind of alt touchstone in 2009, doesnt much care about conventional notions of cool. If they want to get dorky and put in a section that asks you to bust out the medieval garb and hop around on one leg for a minute, theyll do it. And maybe theyll put this song in the lead spot on an EP that follows up the biggest and most successful record of their career. All this went through my mind before finding out, after reading Fall Be Kinds credits, that the flute sample comes courtesy of an artist whose name became a punchline after an endless run of goofy TV spots advertising his music: Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute. Cool? These guys arent sweating it.\nLike their last three EPs of new material, Fall Be Kind exists in the orbit of the full-length that preceded it but it isnt defined by it. Its got songs written before and during the creation of Merriweather Post Pavilion, but theyre songs that didnt fit that record for one reason or another. Given its fragmented genesis, its surprising how listenable and of-a-piece Fall Be Kind is. \"Graze\" flows directly into \"What Would I Want? Sky\", a song that samples Grateful Deads \"Unbroken Chain\" and is easily among the most warm, likeable, and melodic tracks Animal Collective have recorded. It refracts Aquarian optimism through a modern sense of uncertainty, undercutting the loops jovial lilt with a tricky structure and lyrics that seem confused about what will happen next. \"Sky\" contains the first officially licensed sample of the Dead, and its the best marketing move the bands organization has made since they greenlighted Cherry Garcia. Its not easy to take a cut-up voice and make it the centerpiece of a tune, and its harder still to sing along with it in a way that doesnt sound forced. But \"What Would I Want? Sky\" sounds as natural as something that grew out of the earth.\nThe final three songs are more abstract and dreamy. \"Bleed\" feels like an interlude, something the band might have put on an album five years ago. Its a shifting drone, with Portner and Lennoxs treated voices singing one simple refrain. It doesnt develop or do much, but its not supposed to. Instead, it serves as a bridge to the EPs darker second half, which kicks off with \"On a Highway\". Something like the A.C. version of Bob Segers \"Turn the Page\", \"On a Highway\" is a lonesome tour lament. Over a throbbing, dubby background, which is punctuated by thwacks of hand drums that slowly rise in the mix, Portner offers a series of scenes glimpsed out the window of a van, and he gets unusually personal, even referencing his bandmate directly (\"Sick of too much reading/ Jealous of Noahs dreaming/ Cant help my brain from thinking\"). Lennoxs closing \"I Think I Can\" is the one song here that takes a few listens to sink in. Its longer (a touch over seven minutes), with busier production (sequenced piano notes, synth pulses, percussion, and voices flying back and forth between the speakers) and a more circular melody, but the final two minutes provide a terrific payoff to the opening clatter, with Lennox repeating the titles affirmation in a quick descending pattern as the song finally opens up.\nAt 27 minutes, Fall Be Kind is short enough to invite another play once \"I Think I Can\" fades out, which means a return to that striking second half of \"Graze\". When a band tries something that shouldnt work and brings it off, its a sign of confidence. Animal Collectives focus and general disinterest in looking over their shoulders obviously makes what theyre doing that much more appealing. But the most interesting thing about them at this point may be that, despite all the great music theyve been making the past few years, its not hard to imagine them failing. Theyve honed their craft and become very good at what they do, but there still seems to be a desire to go to unfamiliar realms, and its possible that wherever they head next will turn out to be place they dont inhabit as easily. Theres still a sense of gamble with Animal Collective, nothing is fixed-- and thats exactly what makes them an especially exciting band.",

        "article_text": "Death isnt going to come easy for Bobby Krlic, the London-based producer who records as the Haxan Cloak. At least he has Excavation, a sort of multifaceted roadmap of the afterlife, to guide him. This record, his first for Tri Angle, is about the journey taken after death, making it a sequel to his eponymous 2011 debut, which was themed around someone approaching their final days on the planet. Both albums are imagined, instrumental quests, drawn out through electronic compositions with occasional strings. The first record came close to twisted Wicker Man folk at times. This one plunges into a blackened well and never gets out. There is no light relief from Krlics malaise, no sense that we wont be here some day and theres a place at the end of it all where we might find peace. Excavation is quite the opposite. It paints death as a terrifying, complex process, full of confounding turns and illogical rhythms.\nKrlic isnt exactly working in isolation as the Haxan Cloak; he has peers in Demdike Stares drone-shaped darkness, and hes in a similar orbit to the digital trudge-to-oblivion practiced by fellow Londoners Raime. But while Excavation continues a theme, it goes to more expansive places than anything that bears vaguely similar properties. Its bold and domineering, the kind of music that towers over you and casts a giant, intimidating shadow. Theres a magical quality to it, drawn from its transportive nature. Its hard to imagine this being put together in someones bedroom or a crappy studio, mainly because its so far withdrawn from the everyday. Krlic has far grander thoughts in mind. He is, after all, building a whole world here, one full of mysterious scratch marks on walls, bloodstained carpets, or the noose tossed into view on the albums cover.\nExcavation is more soundtrack than regular album, pulling on familiar tropes from the horror world such as the sudden escalation of strings that lead to a stony silence in \"Consumed\". But Krlic doesnt follow a straight path at any point, instead setting muted rhythms in progress and disrupting them just when it feels like youve got a handle on where hes going. The depth is quite extraordinary at times, largely due to the bottomless bass Krlic deploys, helping to depict the afterlife as a relentless slog. In many religions death is seen as a destination, but here its a struggle, another journey, a new set of circumstances with which to grapple. Theres a strong sense of deterioration, of things falling apart. When \"Excavation (Part 2)\" plunges into the quiet it feels like Krlics carefully constructed world faded away, only for it to segue into the queasy strings that beckon in the following \"Mara\" that confirm: yes, you are still here in his personal hell.\nIts an album sequenced with a central narrative in mind, and one thats not without glimmers of hope at key junctures. \"The Mirror Reflecting (Part 2)\" and \"The Drop\" are key tracks, both deploying lighter textures that symbolize a form of redemption from the sooty gloom that eats at the edges of the Haxan Cloak. They come toward the close of the record, suggesting that some kind of unsteady peace has been made in this particular form of purgatory. It adds a resigned air to the album, a sense of accepting fate no matter how bad it may be. Krlic brings the strings into greater view once again during \"The Drop\", heightening the feelings of sadness and empathy that slowly guide us away from the inky path of all-out grief and dejection. Still, the bass hits continue to punch in that sinking feeling and the beats add a dramatic flourish, always emphasizing that this is a place of sickness, not security.\nWith music we like, we often talk about the compulsion to come back to it, that need to hit the repeat button as soon as its over. But music you need a break from can be equally powerful. Excavation has that air, of a place that actually needs some preparation before entering into it. Its not aesthetically similar to Scott Walkers later works, but it similarly highlights how certain music specifically needs the right time, place, and mood to function. Krlic even seems to know it himself, commenting in his Rising feature about the effects of his nine-hour-straight recording sessions. \"Being in that zone for that long can freak you out,\" he said. Instead, Excavation gains power from gathering a little dust for a while, becoming a dark treat to occasionally sink into. Its not a place in which to seek refuge from lifes ills, but rather one in which you can satisfy a perverse need to draw them in closer.",

        "article_text": "I dont know much about the man who writes Twin Shadow songs, but the man in them doesnt really seem like a good dude. In fact, hes a total dick most of the time. \"I dont want to believe or be in love,\" was George Lewis Jr.s climactic mission statement on \"Slow\", and the rest of Forget negated its new romantic sounds with accounts of people who chose to ignore his warning. There was the girl who promised to \"never let another black boy break [her] heart\" and became the subject of \"Tyrant Destroyed\", and then there was the partner in crime on \"Shooting Holes\", who took her fathers gun and was sworn into secrecy. And as a message to the fellas, there was \"I Cant Wait\", where Lewis stole your girl from right under your armpit because she hated your moves, the implication being that she was going to love his. \nThis persona played a huge role in distinguishing Forget, despite much evidence of it being wholly of Brooklyn, ca. 2010: Pretty in Pink sonic nostalgia, a cosign from Grizzly Bear, smeared cover art. But in light of brash interviews and surprisingly torrid live shows, Lewis careerist ambition, pretty boy swagger, and leering libido made clear he was not long for the world of back-patting, hand-holding indie rock. You might find the bad-boy posturing on Confess cover too blatant in announcing Lewis arrival as a self-identifying pop idol, but he refuses to apologize for anything here: not his brash lyrics, laser-focused songwriting, or glossy production. Its a purposefully arrogant star turn that would otherwise be insufferable if Confess didnt make it abundantly clear that Lewis is one of the few guys out there capable of living up to it.\nHes adjusting his role models to fit the situation, staying within the 80s but moving from the Psychedelic Furs and Simple Minds. Instead, hes taking Purple Rain, Born in the U.S.A. and Lost Boys as guides. Were talking leather jackets, sullen glowers, salvation through hit-making. And Confess aspires to the excess of the Reagan years, when all genres were competing for the same MTV slots and the production on pop, rock, and R\u0026B records was essentially the same. But while Confess is slick, it doesnt sound slavishly retro or expensive; in fact, theres a eerie, disembodied artificiality to many of these sounds. \nLewis rangy vocals rightfully remain at the forefront-- sultry and vulnerable in their lower reaches, with a clarion burst in its higher notes that recalls both Peter Gabriel and TV on the Radios Tunde Adebimpe. But nearly every other sound is so crisp and airless that they become compellingly dehumanized. The snares during the disparaging chorus of \"Golden Light\" hit like open-hand slaps or a glass of cold water to the face, and harsh digital clipping on the kick drums and vocals express the claustrophobic lust of \"You Call Me On\". \"I Dont Care\" underlines the startling cruelty of its lyrics with a coda of grunts. \"The One\" is a rare moment of devotion communicated with blinding acoustic glare, while the exaggerated courtship of \"Beg For the Night\" accents its chorus with the utmost of new-money sounds, the orchestra hit. \nOn a purely sonic level, Confess will tell you \"greed is good,\" and its underlined by the economy of the songwriting, which shows a clear progression from the occasionally stunning but unbalanced Forget. The 10 songs on Confess operate only in power moves, the verses sneering, seducing, doing whatever they can to draw the listener in before every choruses ascends and explodes. Having recorded nearly all of Confess by himself, you hear a perfectionists internal competition in Lewis, each song subject to merciless editing to assure that if he realizes the death wish alluded to in the \"Five Seconds\" video, hell leave a beautiful corpse and a record of 10 fail-proof singles. Its textbook, time-honored stuff, but its rarely done at this level. Whether its the lush power-balladry of \"Beg For the Night\" and \"Be Mine Tonight\" or throttle-pushing rockers like \"You Call Me On\", Confess is defined by its melodic and emotional immediacy. This is no where more evident than it is on the cyclical refrain of the all-hook single \"Five Seconds\"-- \"straight to the heart.\"\nThe ruthless efficiency extends to the lyrics, and this is what ultimately gives Confess its edge, pushing it into something more illicitly alluring. Its indeed a hyper-masculine record, almost every single lyric occurring at a relationship flashpoint between Lewis and a royal female \"you\" whose lust only confirms her misunderstanding of him. Combined with his refusal to sugarcoat anything, the first instinct is to assume its a misogynist record as well, but Confess isnt macho or \"bro.\" The songs are about dishonesty and what is revealed in desiring love but acting out of lust. The arrangement of \"Golden Light\" takes its cues from the secular uplift of Arcade Fire while flipping the carnal chorus of \"Atomic Dog\" into something simultaneously metaphysical and cynical-- \"Some people say youre the golden light/ And if I chase after you, doesnt mean its true.\" Its all to easy to hear a lyric like \"I dont give a damn about your dreams/ A whole world that is falling at the seams\" from \"You Call Me On\" as pitiless. But theres an equanimity to Lewis viewpoint as he offers \"thats what its supposed to do\" as a stark epigram of cold comfort. \nAnd he gets as good as he gives, rarely painting himself as a savior or even someone worthy of envy. \"Patient\" describes a no-strings fling that youd think would be the optimum scenario in a Twin Shadow song, but the refusal to define it as such is torture for Lewis and you can hear it in Confess most over the top arrangement, a bridge cobbling together drumline snares, a shredding guitar, and a push of his 80s influences somewhere towards New Jack Swing. Twin Shadow gets into darker metal-R\u0026B territory on \"I Dont Care\" whose superficially shocking admonishments to a morally suspect woman brings it awfully close to \"Dirty Diana\" territory. But \"I Dont Care\", like most of Confess, doesnt sound ego-fueled or even hateful. Lovers on Confess are equal co-conspirators, liars, fully complicit and bent on mutually assured destruction. Records from the likes of Drake and the Weeknd have been instructive on how to toast to groin-led douchebags. But theres little hedonism or depravity here. On Confess, sex is dispassionately viewed like any addictive substance, one that basically destroys people who use it to fill a spiritual void.\nThis corrosive thread running throughout Confess helps illustrate the difference in intent between Twin Shadows two simply titled albums. Forget hinted at traumatic experiences that Lewis was trying to process years after the fact and figured hed be better off ignoring, whereas Confess doesnt actually cop to much-- just the challenge to \"say just what you mean and give up everything.\" So then its curious that during one of the softer moments of Confess, Lewis admits, \"Ill cry when the movies over.\" Hes the cocky, successful, brutally honest lothario who almost always gets his comeuppance in cinema and is verboten in indie rock. But this is pop music where the bad guy wins. ",

        "article_text": "Heres a joke: Black Leotard Fronts maggot-brained \"Casual Friday\" kickstarts the DFA Compilation #2 with a blast of pink streamers, mutant glitter, and a series of Gainsbourg-Does-Frankfurt whatnots whose sex quotient, to piggish ears, rivals the breathiest, most fecal shit-porn yelp. The Greatest Peep Show Ever then keeps on peeping for about 40 more seconds, when suddenly all three members of this disco-fuck troupe start chanting, \"Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!\" like theyre on \"Sesame Street\". Its the audio equivalent of, say, the MILF Hunter going off-camera mid-hunt and putting on Groucho Marx glasses and a Dr. Seuss Cat hat before coming back and expecting us to pick up where we left off.\nAround that songs three-minute mark, Black Leotard Front play their cheapest, dirtiest trick, offering up ad nauseam a clumsy English translation of the songs Vorwort, replacing the originals self-involved whispers with militant matters of fact: \"I was leaving the office.\" \"I took off my dress.\" \"I put on my overcoat to surprise you in the flesh.\" By this point, \"Casual Friday\" is barely a fifth of the way through its 15-minute runtime, the three-disc DFA Compilation #2 has hardly even started, and there we are, pants around ankles and red in the kisser. If this review was Uncle Milty, it would raise its palms and smirk.\n\"Casual Friday\" sums up DFA Records circa 2004 with startling accuracy. The qualities that have typically characterized the label-- rapt attention to genre, an implicit skepticism of easy and less song-y dance music, a subtle sense of humor-- continue to crystallize as a slew of new additions (sound engineers Delia \u0026 Gavin and the aforementioned Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Liquid Liquid) expand and diversify its often pigeonholed roster. These guys actually do give a shit, all the way down to the packaging and sequencing of Compilation #2, which collects the DFAs vinyl-only releases from this year and more than a few compilation-only exclusives. What could have been a mere anthology of the labels uniformly excellent 2004 output is, additionally, a meticulously assembled personal narrative. This is a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, no-bullshit disposition and-- lets say it-- the worlds best fucking handclaps.\nTracks like the lanky \"Casual Friday\", Pixeltans sub-bass masterpiece \"Get Up/Say What (DFA Remix)\", and LCD Soundsystems still unspeakably great \"Yeah\" are 10-minute dance songs with beginnings, middles, and ends; people who complain about the downtime on \"Get Up\" or the crass acid freakout finale of \"Yeah\" completely miss the point. Delia \u0026 Gavins Gottschingkind \"El Monte\" and the DFA remix of \"Rise\" are even more expansive, as patterns settle in and flesh out before the next move is made, a bravado afforded to only the most tightly-wound loops.\nThe DFAs remix of J.O.Y.s \"Sunplus\" wins the labels \"Most Bizarre Release Award\"-- the reception to it has been mixed, and for many people this is the first DFA release they havent liked-- but its also possibly their most important record. James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy have worked on several unlikely acts at this point-- N.E.R.D. and \"She Wants To Move\" come to mind-- but in truth their high-carb basslines and unclamped hi-hats were making them fat, and its about time they went on a diet. Like it or not-- and I like it-- their Slits-y, minimal \"Sunplus\" remix speaks to the teams crucial ability to change and stay the same all at once: Their malleability is on perfect display here. The label boasts further variety with Juan MacLeans crooked riddim \"Dance Hall Modulator Dub\" and Liquid Liquids re-recording of \"Bellhead\". On the latter, Murphy and Goldsworthy admirably keep low profiles in the face of such personally influential living legends, merely trading the originals trash-can reverb for crisp percussion and about twenty more BPM.\nOld reliables (The Raptures previously UK-only \"Alabama Sunshine\" and a dub mix of \"Sister Savior\"; a fine drone remix of Black Dices tour-only single \"Wastered\", fittingly renamed \"Wasteder\"); and old favorites (LCD Soundsystems \"Beat Connection\"; Eyes remix of Black Dices \"Endless Happiness\") fill out the rest of this musical annal, most notably touching upon The Raptures departure from the DFA. Bygones are indeed bygones, though, and if anyones really upset about that rift, the third disc of Compilation #2 is a top-notch party mix with-- get this-- actual mixing. Along with Beats In Spaces Tim Sweeney, Tim Goldsworthy outdoes himself on practically every track transition: Jittery percussive swells on \"Bellhead\" creep early into \"Echoes\" and energize the songs descending figures; the cowbells and clean squeaks of \"Sunplus\" martial the beatless \"El Monte\" and reach through all the way into the beginning of Juan MacLeans \"Give Me Every Little Thing\"; and at the end, \"Beat Connection\" fights with \"Yeah\" for volume, until both of them play together at full-blast. In a word, its glorious, a fitting old-meets-new, tongue-in-cheek gesture to conclude one of 2004s most worthwhile tales.\n ",

        "article_text": "The Brooklyn-based duo High Places are most often compared to Beat Happening, a band cherished for their regression-- into musical primitivism, adolescent sexuality, and any other condition that twenty- and thirtysomethings bemoan the loss of in therapy. High Places indulgence in nursery rhymes aside, the kinship is mostly an ideological one: Like Beat Happening, they exult in the simple.\n03/07 - 09/07, a collection of the bands first 7\" and stray compilation tracks (released through the mp3 subscription service eMusic), shows a group whose comfort zone isnt the folky imperative, but heady, hippyish imprecision. The songs here are almost all identical: polyrhythmic miniatures built by small drums and shakers, clouded by blankets of echo and reverb; deliberately basic structures; short, and in their own way, catchy and pretty. Rhythms suggest provinces a step removed from where other white, arty urbanites tend to dwell: There are flashes of soca, reclined bounces that remind me of Indian music, and though \"Sandy Feat\"s swing could be Tom Pettys \"American Girl\" or David Bowies \"Modern Love\", they inflect it they way Brazilian bands like Os Mutantes did (or Paul Simon on Rhythm of the Saints).\nHigh Places trunk-rattling impulses are juxtaposed with a spacious, almost tranquil atmosphere, with Rob Barbers percussion chiming and floating rather than physically hitting, and Mary Pearsons sweetly flat vocals layered to the point that her lyrics often become indistinguishable. That blur makes High Places music hypnotic: Pearson chatters away like a light-headed kid on the playground on one song and intones a mantra on the next, and its only then that you notice how both forms operate on the same principle: repetition induces calm. (Full disclosure: Pearsons sister is a former Pitchfork employee.)\nPearsons vocals and the duos lyrics are charmingly coquettish: She reduces falling in love to \"Oh, youre a pretty boy, a pretty boy\" and writes letters to Martians. \"Jump In\", penned for Pearsons Michigan elementary school, is so full of encouragement that it scans like the transcription of a guidance counselor or junior minister. \"Canary\" apologizes to animals displaced by ecological warfare-- \"we really messed up.\" The sentiments are frank, but I out them for three reasons: Theres nothing wrong with being positive, the bands confident enough to handle it, and they make me happy.\n\"Universe\"s lyric makes this clear: \"It takes a lot of guts to be a little baby in this place.\" The idea of returning to infancy might resonate as a dippy bohemian nightmare, but in a society where moderate cynicism is considered a higher road to intelligence than acceptance and curiosity, and where sarcasm is considered a social reflex, youd be hard pressed to argue with them-- it does take guts.",

        "article_text": "Should Beyoncé choose to settle in the world of Adult Contemporary one day, shell have most of the legwork already done. Shes spent the time since 4, an album that playfully extolled the virtues of marriage, crafting a role for herself in that sphere with the ambitious grace of a good politician. Imagine the fun she had requesting the big hair and bigger fur to help President Obama ring in his second term, or in gussying herself up like Marie Antoinette to promote an international arena tour called The Mrs. Carter Show. The hedge-betting deals with Pepsi and H\u0026M, the (now-defunct) lifestyle blog/newsletter à la Gwyneth Paltrows goop, the reunion with Destinys Child, the exquisitely dull autobiographical documentary—shes seemed entirely poised to join Jay Z on his cloud of moneyed middle-age.\nIn retrospect, the adult gloss feels like an elaborate foil to the trouble she’d been cooking up in private all along. Beyoncé, her fifth solo album, repositions the singer as the Houston-bred Yoncé, a woman lustier and surlier than B, more playful than Bey, fiercer than Sasha but softer and more natural than the lot. The album is brassy but elegant, its post-coital breath smelling faintly of cheap liquor sipped from a crystal flute. It finds Beyoncé shifting gears to pull off her most explicit and sonically experimental music to date, exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music.\nIt’s tempting to read Beyoncé’s hard edges as an attempt to ride the success of Rihanna or Miley Cyrus’ risqué agendas—but to do so would be to look past the album’s true provocations. Beyoncé pushes boundaries not because it sells sex at every turn, but because it treats a power-balanced marriage as a place where sexuality thrives. At a time when when young people are gripped by an ideological fear of monogamy’s advertised doldrums, Beyoncé boldly proposes the idea that a woman’s prime—personal, professional, and especially sexual—can occur within a stable romantic partnership. Monogamy has never sounded more seductive or less retrograde as when dictated on Beyoncés terms. The innuendo can be bawdy and overblown—\"Can you lick my Skittles/ Thats the sweetest in the middle\" on \"Blow\"—but sincerely so. And who would allow Jay Z’s instantly infamous breasts/breakfast line anywhere near the stargazing boom of “Drunk in Love” but someone truly infatuated with him? What’s more is that the erotic themes don’t feel out-of-step with the album’s more decorous moments, like the stadium-filling “XO” or “Blue”, its requisite treatise on motherhood. In Beyoncé’s world, there are illicit doors to be unlocked in the halls of tradition and vice versa.\nThe record reverberates with the energy of a conservative pop star navigating trends without grasping for them. Its crew of 44 writers, producers, and directors skews heavily toward the hip-hop realm and incorporates niche talents, something Beyoncé tried on 4 when she teamed with artists like Switch and pulled visual ideas from little-known European choreographers discovered via YouTube. Its the collective effort of an all-star team with a deep bench, with contributions from mainstays like Pharrell and The-Dream, to fresh faces like Chairlifts Caroline Polachek, a creative director from streetwear brand Supreme, and a practically-unknown producer named Boots.\nBeyoncé’s best songs often reject traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere—she may have taken some cues from her sister Solange, who now leads a particular wave of collaborative, left-field R\u0026B. The record, her darkest and lushest yet, has a tendency to echo, stop abruptly, or place two separate songs in the space of one. Its most bracing moments are also its toughest and weirdest, like \"***Flawless\", a two-part growler that makes feminist TED Talk fodder sound legitimately menacing. Timbaland and Justin Timberlake join The-Dream on \"Partition\" in service of the mean-mugging Yoncé, who snarls and bares her teeth as though the most revered rapper of all time is nobody but her little husband. At the center lies Beyoncé’s practically unfair abilities as a performer—you get the sense that Lady Gaga or Ciara could no sooner pull off the scale or quality of Beyoncé than you or I could pull off a suitable rendition of any of its songs in a karaoke bar.  \nBeyoncé has loosened up her delivery, too, in a way that highlights her elasticity and shows her pop-cultural antennae tuned to the right channels. Who could’ve predicted that some of the most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013 would not arrive by way of anthemic chorus or assembly-line arrangement, but in Beyoncé’s ad-libbing? You already know the ones: Surfbort, she grunts on “Drunk in Love”, slinging a hashtag like it’s the name of a line of Ikea chairs, the single word serving as both shorthand for woman-on-top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence. You’d also be hard-pressed to find an internet-savvy person in America who hasn’t been possessed by the idea that he or she woke up like this, brain emblazoned with Beyoncé’s half-second I’m so flawless I gave myself a seizure dance. Shes achieved the rare feat of validating meme culture by capturing its sneaky potency and delight rather than falling into its cheap, dehumanizing traps. This is a “visual album,” sure, but it’s also a package of modern codes and discreet campaigns, a field of meaningful virtual dioramas. In this sense Beyoncé has a newfound spiritual ally in Drake (Worst! YOLO!),—he shows up on Beyoncé on the bruised \"Mine\"— her only peer to successfully streamline an internet-rooted mindset into a large-scale pop arena and seek profundity in the process.\nWhich is all to say that Beyoncé has delivered on the promise she inadvertently made by dropping an album and its expansive visual counterpart late on a Thursday night in December on iTunes, free of traditional fanfare. Call it a coup or just another victory for her mammoth PR apparatus, but consider the alternatives: The strategy probably would have failed if the quality wasnt there, and the album could not have achieved such an impact without its rogue—in spirit, at least—method of distribution. Beyoncé was unleashed upon the world in a way that could only succeed right now, with an aim to make the audience consume it the way it would have long ago. It’s a line that could be ripped straight from the mouth of an investment-drunk tech startup founder, but it’s true: Beyoncé seized the powers of a medium characterized by its short attention span to force the world to pay attention. Leave it to the posterchild of convention to brush convention aside and leave both sides feeling victorious.",

        "article_text": "Beatportal.com user Yield Load thinks \"dubstep is wicked music, but I didnt know how your suppose to dance to it.\" The grammars not there, but the idea is: Dubstep-- the nocturnal, claustrophobic subgenera of British electronic music that emerged from garage and 2-step-- is descended from dance music but doesnt sound like its made for dancing. The tempos feel slow, the mood is usually threatening, lonely, or both. If theres any movement I can imagine going comfortably with dubstep, its what Three 6 Mafias DJ Paul rapped about on \"Side 2 Side\", and the standard step at indie-rock shows worldwide: \"Im in the club posted up, got my arms folded... twistin my body from side to side.\"\nOf all the videos of dubstep dancing I clicked through online, two stick out in my mind. One is by an overweight teenager in what is likely his parents living room, a decorative ships lifesaver on the wall between what appear to be illustrations of the seaside, a large desktop computer at one end of the room, an open door leading to a yard on the other. A track by the producer Skream comes on, and he starts to move his fists up and down like a child banging steadily on a table, taking very deliberate steps across a carpet. Thats it. The other is of two men, one black and one white, dressed in suits, dancing in some kind of white, computer-generated void, as the names of their dance steps flash across the bottom of the screen. My favorite is called \"Lost in the woods (with bewildered stare)\". I dont know if the comedy was intentional. Either way, its a sign that dubstep has reached a particular position of cultural importance: hundreds of thousands of people are watching a suburban kid dance to it on YouTube.\nHyperdub is usually cited as dubsteps most prominent and progressive label, but its hard to even call most of their releases dubstep, strictly speaking. Theyve released off-centered hip-hop (Flying Lotus), brooding chill-out music that recasts the chill-out room as a bunker (Kode9 \u0026 the Spaceape), and misfit rave music (Zomby). Hyperdubs sound isnt dubstep, its urban noir in the 21st century, or at least how the 21st century looked in 1970s science fiction: A procession of florescent signs over an empty street. 5: Five Years of Hyperdub-- their first CD compilation-- has the tall task of trying to anthologize the label without making it seem like theyve run out of ideas. Their solution is sensible: One disc of new material; one disc of classics.\nLike any label compilation, 5 functions as a kind of mission statement: Heres what weve done; heres what we do. Most of the music on it sounds made for the head, not the feet. In a way, its like a modern analog to Warps 1992 compilation, Artificial Intelligence, whose sleeve was a picture of an empty armchair in a living room-- electronic music that has a place in the home.\nDescribing his music to The Guardian in 2007, the producer Burial said, \"I want it to be like a little sanctuary. Its like that 24-hour stand selling tea on a rainy night, glowing in the dark.\" His two albums, Burial and Untrue, have more in common with Massive Attack and ambient music than anything youd hear at a club. Zomby, on the other hand-- whose Where Were U in 92? sounded like jungle and drumnbass chewed up by a Game Boy-- described his daily routine to XLR8R magazine as \"lots of rolling joints\" and \"eating some chicken-based dish à la carte.\" These guys arent public faces, theyre lost in the crowd-- theyre people spacing out in their living rooms, alone. Burials identity was secret for two years after he started putting out records. Zomby will be photographed only while wearing a mask.\nAnyone familiar with Hyperdub-- or dubstep in general-- will know most of the classics disc. Thats the point. One of the labels first singles-- Kode9 \u0026 the Spaceapes bloodless cover of the Specials \"Ghost Town\"-- doesnt even have a beat behind it; it floats. Burial shows up twice, once with \"South London Boroughs\", once with \"Distant Lights\". Theres Zombys nightmarish \"Spliff Dub (Rustie Remix)\", whose sampled vocalist sings, \"One spliff a day keep the evil away,\" over a track of 8-bit garbage and what sounds like synthesizers in a deep fryer. (The music captures weeds paranoia more than its elation-- I mean, is it supposed to make me like pot or fear it?)\nThe word \"classics\" has a kind of accelerated, lax definition in dance music, and some of the tracks on the second disc are from as recent as earlier this year. The heaviest is Jokers \"Digidesign\", a spacious, bone-simple piece of 80s-style R\u0026B based around a handful of acidic countermelodies, so elegant it almost plays like a jingle.\nThe first disc-- the new one-- is good, but doesnt hold up to the classics. Those expected to bring it, as it were-- Burial, Zomby, Joker, Flying Lotus-- do, just not in any revelatory ways. Of the bunch, Zomby is probably the most satisfying because hes so hard to pin down: \"Tarantula\" doesnt sound exactly like anything hes released before, and his most recent single, \"Digital Flora\"/\"Digital Fauna\" doesnt sound like \"Tarantula\". I was never sold on Quarta 330s chiptune routine, nor on Kode9s music either-- their new contributions roll off. The only track that actively perplexes me is Black Chows \"Purple Smoke\", whose junkshop hip-hop beats are the most brainlessly retro flourish on the whole compilation, and whose come-hither Japanese vocalist confuses sexy with corny. Minor complaints. Hyperdub deserves this: Theyve reshaped the little world they work in, and theyve reached out to a wider one-- whether that world dances or not.",

        "article_text": "\"All those brash young studs/ They have no idea what it’s like up here,\" Danish punk Elias Bender Rønnenfelt moans over a rolling midtempo drag on the title track to Iceage’s brilliant third album, Plowing Into the Field of Love. The line first scans as a refined upgrade of the band’s usual alienation—a dark basement swapped for an ivory tower. But it also has the same sardonic self-awareness that coats the instantly iconic video for Plowing’s first single, \"The Lord’s Favorite\", which featured the really, really, really ridiculously good-looking Rønnenfelt and his youthful comrades smearing lipstick on themselves, taking champagne baths, and enjoying cocktails with (d)ice in their glasses. \"Part of me wants to hurt you/ Tear in your hair/ But I don’t do that now,\" the singer admits, staring into the camera and lighting a cigarette as the band takes on tricky cowpunk shapes underneath his voice; it is, at the least, a unique approach to acknowledging newfound maturity.\nIndeed, Plowing Into the Field of Love finds Iceage growing up on their own terms. Up to this point, they’ve developed incrementally, taking a knife to the rough-around-the-edges teenage fury of the 2011 debut LP New Brigade and cutting fresh, sharp ribbons of flesh on last year’s refined sophomore effort You’re Nothing. Essentially a bolder, somewhat brighter update of what came before, You’re Nothing contained few hints of the baroque terrain that Iceage are traversing now. But the dense lockstep drone that closed out that record’s \"Morals\" suggested that Iceage could slow things down without losing their dead-eyed sense of passion.\nOn Plowing, Iceage make a radical shift away from their hack-and-slash past and towards what is, for them, unexplored territory—morose piano balladeering, sprightly country-rock figures, distinctly Irish-sounding drinking anthems. Their journey mirrors the transformation that the punks of the 80s underwent when devising the perfect alchemy of hardcore’s youthful burn and Americana’s weary shuffle (see Mekons, X, Meat Puppets). So Iceage aren’t exploring new sounds on Plowing, culturally speaking, but nothing they’ve done in the past five years suggested that they were capable of such a transformation. Despite the new approach, Iceage still sound like themselves, so when Asger Valentin’s mournful trumpet cuts through the rolling stomp of \"Glassy Eyed, Dormant and Veiled\", the most surprising thing about the instrument isn’t its mere presence, but how at-home it sounds amidst the band’s newly considered arrangements.\nA sense of steadiness, a measured approach to abandon, marks Iceage’s transformation from a very good band to a Great Band on Plowing. While New Brigade contained bursts of unexpected melodic sweetness, the gruesome You’re Nothing often sounded like it was held together with little more than congealed blood and matted hair. On Plowing, the band swings to the opposite pole, sounding threateningly tight even when walking the edge of full collapse, similar to 80s-era Sonic Youth’s balance of control and dissonance. Dark piano chords serve as an anchor for \"How Many\"s buzzsaw guitars, embracing a half-time tempo change at the song’s midsection that crashes through the burning scenery; \"Cimmerian Shade\" kicks off with a hollow pound courtesy of drummer Dan Kjær Nielsen, accented by guitars both brawny and thin-sounding that abrasively scrape against each other. \nAlbum centerpiece \"Stay\" somewhat hilariously opens as a waltz in 3/4 time, speeding up uncontrollably at the command of Rønnenfelt’s most operative, visually arresting lyrical aside on Plowing (\"Hands/ Become thundering hooves\") before building to a furious burn that stands as Iceage’s finest moment of feral aggression. Plowing’s strangest moment, then, comes in the form of its most straightforward tune: \"Abundant Living\", the record’s only sub-three-minute song that one could reasonably listen to while skipping down a sidewalk. Jakob Tvilling Pless wields a jaunty mandolin figure over the band’s besotted sway, which takes on a Gaelic punk resemblance as Rønnenfelt promises in a miserable cadence, \"I’ll bring it all down here with me/ Soaked in alcohol.\"\nRønnenfelt’s lyrics are front and center throughout Plowing—partially a result of his improved English, as he told Pitchfork recently—and they paint the type of self-portrait you’d expect from a punkish youth in his twenties: fatalistic, ferociously inquisitive, drunk on the promise of tomorrow and even drunker on whatever’s flowing from the tap at this very moment. Images of absent fathers, prison cells, and drowning are evoked, and the album’s parting line—\"I am plowing into the field of love/ They will place me in a hearse\"—reads as poetically grim as the limited perspective of youth allows. \"I have a sense of utopia/ Of what I truly ought to do,\" Rønnenfelt proclaims in the middle of \"How Many\", and that sense of gritted-teeth naïveté comes to define Plowing Into the Field of Love as a whole. This is the sound of Iceage finding a balance between getting older and seeking immortality by way of leaping into an abandoned-lot fire head-first. It’s beautiful and ugly at the same time and, for now, Iceage have found their own unstable sense of peace.",

        "article_text": "When they started making burly, progressive sludge almost 10 years ago, Baroness werent teenagers: They were grown men with a refined, nuanced approach to heavy metal. Even in 2003, it wasnt your typical Southern sludge swamp. That said, I doubt anyone listening then couldve predicted Yellow \u0026 Green. The quartets new 18-song, 75-minute double album offers a broad, rich expanse of pretty, psychedelic, occasionally heavy, mostly straight-up rock that veers easily into pop, post-rock, and lulling ambient washes. There are a number of new elements to Baroness in 2012-- frontman John Baizley is the father of a young daughter and lives in Philadelphia instead of Savannah; after the recording of Yellow \u0026 Green, Matt Maggioni came on board as the groups new bassist (which means longtime member Summer Welch is no more). The sound itself is the biggest shift, though it shouldnt come as a total surprise. Theyve hinted at these new avenues, and even tentatively explored a few, on their first two LPs, Blue Record and Red Album. Whats surprising here is how well it all works.\nTheres almost always some filler on a record of this length-- its a casualty of double albums-- but theres an impressive scarcity of it here. Even the songs that float by more humbly, or as background music, ultimately have a place in the overall dynamic by the first or second listen. And they are all songs. Take the \"themes\" that open Yellow and Green, respectively, the warm, aqueous two minutes of \"Yellow Theme\", the more drifting, airy, chilly (and post-rock anthemic) four-and-a-half minutes of \"Green Theme\". These are beautiful instrumentals, compositions with actual force and not more incidentals.\nI recently interviewed Baizley about the record. He detailed how the groups idea of heaviness shifted from their early days to the present. He explained that \"tricks\" like \"10 amplifiers on stage, a ton of volume, and notes on [a] guitar that were more appropriate for bass guitar\" were a kind of \"artifice to mask youthful songwriting.\" In the present, the group is more focused on subtlety: \"Now that songs have become more important to us, were trying to find the more nuanced, more appropriate-for-us idea of heavy.\" Yellow \u0026 Green showcases this new take in spades. As Baizley put it, \"the Baroness-circa-2012 definition of heavy [is] not a tuning and its not necessarily a volume; its more of a feeling or an idea or some goal post that were headed towards.\" And, practically speaking, the cleaner singing is a kind of survival tactic: His and backup vocalist Pete Adams vocal cords couldnt continue along the raw, shouting path theyd set for themselves earlier on.\nBaizley stressed that, although its a double LP, Yellow \u0026 Green is not a concept record. That said, one theme certainly leaps out: that of aging, and the ways it changes our ideas surrounding music from one stage of adulthood to the next. Albums that force artists to go deep into themselves as people and as musicians tend to end up as accidental concept records, collections that document the time they pushed themselves to create, and the life they were otherwise living at that time. But this one feels very closely aligned to getting closer to 40, to feeling your bones creak a little more, your eyes getting a little weaker.\nIts in the lyrics with words that fixate on disappearances, fractures, sleep, bruises, bracing for death, failing hearts, and saying goodnight to your father. Or theres the nostalgia of a line like, \"when we were kids we never felt so young, take me to a hazy Sunday morning.\" Then again, we also get plenty of blood (\"this apple makes me sick, says this pig upon the stick, its my own blood\") and water, as both baptism and drowning, or beginning and end. (A track like \"March to the Sea\" has water in its title, but theres something about its musicality that brings to mind early-1990s post-rock, too, and that post-Slint, June of 44-style obsession with anchors and sails.)\nJohn Congleton, who also produced Blue, again gels perfectly with the band. Each song has levels and layers: Its an album for headphones as well as one for lighters in the middle of a smoky club. You get weird gurgles of noise, shimmering deep layers of sound, electronic swirls. \"Twinkler\" is like a downcast campfire greek chorus; \"Cocainium\" has that kind of ambiance, too, but picks up the drum beat-- its a variation on psychedelic pop that made me think of the Turtles until the muscular bass, distorted guitars, and grungy chorus.\nBaizley said the cover art, and the songs themselves, reflect the feeling of the moment before or after a disaster; of course, these are very different feelings, but I know what he means. Its not all waiting around and recovering. Theres pure climactic catharsis, as youd expect from Baroness, but these tracks work in a way Baroness songs havent previously. Instead of explosions, billows, and howls, we get a more meditative air, even on some of the bigger rockers like \"Take My Bones Away\" or the rollicking \"Board Up the House\". Each mountain is chased with something a littler gentler. Its thrilling hearing people this technically adept holding back a little, showing restraint, and cramming what they know into a pop nugget. Its what Torche have done well in the past, especially on Meanderthal, but its bigger, more spacious and stadium-sized here. (Like if Torche actually were the Foo Fighters.)\nOne of these climaxes is \"Eula\", the heart-crushing finale to Yellow, seven minutes of crisp acoustics, atmospheric (and anthemic) vocals, and warped chiming sounds that accompany descriptions of bones breaking, a house becoming a cage-- in other words, the end of something. But its not: \"Eula\" ushers in the more pastoral Green, which also stands on its own as a great record. After the main \"Green\" theme comes \"Board Up the House\", a bit of shout-along rocknroll with a Radiohead-like approach to percussive filters and shifts. Elsewhere on this half theres the thorny Fahey-pop of \"Stretchmarker\" and a dose of chewy pop-metal via \"The Line Between\", another possible single. It ends with \"If I Forget Thee, Lowcountry\", an outro like the Yellow opening: We get that slippery, aqueous sound again.\nIve always liked the elegance of the groups primary-color schemes-- topical, clearly delineated ways to make each album feel like a whole. Here, more than anywhere else, the colors arent needed: These songs stick together well without a framework. Tracks play off each other, make echoes, and then go on. Each disc stands on its own as a powerful document; together, they genuinely earn the word \"epic.\" During a video interview we did with the band, Baizley joked that you should go for a run, walk your dog, or otherwise take a break from Yellow \u0026 Green at the end of the first half, before venturing into the second. The halves do elegantly mirror each other-- each with its nine songs, intro, and finale-- and a pause could make sense. But I prefer listening to the entire thing from start to finish. This is an impressive effort, one that involved a lot of heavy lifting, and its best experienced with that sort of commitment.",

        "article_text": "With this week’s shock release of Black Messiah, soul singer and multi-instrumentalist DAngelo, the man music critic Robert Christgau once earnestly dubbed \"R\u0026B Jesus,\" returns with his first album of new material in 14 years. It was not, as many have suggested, 14 years of silence. The last DAngelo album, 2000’s Voodoo, was a near perfect communion of buttery soul, Crisco-fried funk, and hip-hop thump, but the video for its calling card ,\"Untitled (How Does It Feel?)\", a lingering, sensual glance over the singer’s face and chest, turned him into an unwitting sex symbol. Live shows soon descended into catcalling, and D, convinced his music had become an accessory to his looks, slipped slowly out of sight. Dispatches grew scarce and worrisome. There were arrests. There was a car accident. For a while, DAngelo appeared to follow talented but troubled forbears Marvin Gaye and Sly Stone into the dark.\nEven in darkness there was still music. DAngelo guested on albums by J Dilla, Q-Tip, Snoop Dogg, and more. He taught himself to play guitar. There were perennial promises of a new album. DAngelo returned to the stage in 2012 peppering sets of old favorites with carefully chosen covers and unreleased new material. Black Messiah isn’t a sneak attack; it’s a slow-simmering gumbo finally boiled over. We tasted its fearless ambivalence to genre boundaries in 2007 when Roots maestro Questlove snuck an early version of the stately Joe Pass homage of \"Really Love\" to Australia’s Triple J Radio, in 2010 when the punk-hop scorcher \"1000 Deaths\" briefly slipped onto YouTube and in 2012 when DAngelo returned to television to unveil the big band funk smartbomb \"Sugah Daddy\" on the BET Awards. Still, it’s a wonder to hear his mutant groove unblemished by the passage of time and stretched around this gobstopping cosmic slop of country funk, psych and new wave.\nBlack Messiah is a study in controlled chaos. The nightmarish chorus of \"1000 Deaths\" arrives late and fierce, as though the band unfurled its crunchy, lumbering vamp just long enough to violently snatch it out from under us. \"The Charade\"s Minneapolis sound funk rock follows, every bit as bright as the previous track was menacing until you zero in on the threadbare heart-sickness of D and P-Funk affiliate Kendra Foster’s lyrics. Black Messiah pulls together disparate threads few predecessors have had the smarts or audacity to unite. One song might channel Funkadelic, another, the Revolution, but the shiftless mad doctor experimentation and the mannered messiness at the root of it all is unmistakably the Vanguard. Black Messiah is a dictionary of soul, but DAngelo is the rare classicist able to filter the attributes of the greats in the canon into a sound distinctly his own. It’s at once familiar and oddly unprecedented, a peculiar trick to pull on an album recorded over the span of a decade.\nThe timeliness of Black Messiah’s message is doubly astounding. The album was pieced together over painstaking years and originally pegged for launch next year, but D, affected by national unrest around unprosecuted police officer involved shootings in Ferguson, MO and New York City, nudged the release date up to speak to the times. Black Messiah plays out most like Sly Stone’s There’s a Riot Goin’ On in its penetrating sense of disorder. Where Voodoo concerned itself chiefly with the ups and downs of cohabitation, the new music steps outside to see what’s going on, and it ain’t good news. \"1000 Deaths\" folds the old adage about cowards and soldiers into a word about guns, fear and desperation. \"The Charade\" calls bullshit on a knotty history of systemic racism. (\"All we wanted was a chance to talk/ ‘Stead weve only got outlined in chalk.\") \"Prayer\" looks for strength from on high, opening on a choppy Lord’s Prayer whose signal keeps cutting out.\nAlongside this wartime pith even the sunnier songs come across darkly. The bipartite nostalgia romp \"Back to the Future\" looks for solace in memories ostensibly because the present is discouraging. The love songs run a little morbid. The titular pledge of \"Betray My Heart\" doesn’t speak fealty so much as candor, and the album’s barn burner of a closer \"Another Life\" is a song of devotion in the vein of the Stylistics’ \"You Are Everything\"—except that the couple never really meets. Black Messiah is about finding something to hang onto in dire times, soldiering through the infuriating insanity of oppression with a support system in tow. \"It’s about people rising up in Ferguson and in Egypt and in Occupy Wall Street and in every place where a community has had enough and decides to make change happen,\" DAngelo writes in the liner notes. \"Black Messiah is not one man. It’s a feeling that, collectively, we are all that leader.\" He may have taken well over a decade to show face again, but it turns out DAngelo is right on time.",

        "article_text": "The blitzing \"Pimp My Pyramid\" scheme. The pulsing honeycomb. The tiny metal heads bobbing up and down. The Lite-Brite leather jacket reveal. The dude in front of me who wouldnt let a pair of crutches stop him from dancing as if the apocalypse were mere minutes away. The sensual explosion that was Daft Punks Alive 2007 show is difficult to overstate-- or reproduce. Even with the biggest, flattest, sharpest HD set-up, theres no way to sufficiently recreate the most exuberant LED-laden music blowout ever staged. So Daft Punk didnt even try: There will be no Alive 2007 DVD.\nCommenting on the decision, Daft Punks Thomas Bangalter recently told Pitchfork, \"The thousands of clips on the internet are better to us than any DVD that could have been released.\" And, in many ways, the Alive tour is a perfect match for YouTube-- the ancient Egypt by-way-of \"The Jetsons\" spectacle barrelling its way through shitty compression quality with blinding force. But still, even the most hectic web clip cant equal the French duos visceral sound-and-vision assault, so the focus of Alive 2007 falls on the reason why Daft Punk were allowed to lug 11 tons of equipment around the world for the last 19 months in the first place: their music. Playing like a flawlessly sequenced and paced greatest hits album, this full-set Paris recording from June finds Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo connecting the booms among their three albums while officially cementing one of the years most rewarding and welcomed comebacks.\nLest we forget, before the out-of-nowhere debut of the now-iconic 3D triangle in April 2006, it seemed like Daft Punk lost the plot. The monster riffage and mind-numbing gloom of 2005s Human After All had our favorite party-starters turning downright nihilistic. And early screenings of their art-house opus, Electroma, evoked (unfortunately accurate) comparisons to Vincent Gallos on-the-road/oral sex epic Brown Bunny (except with endless scenes of hunk-o-metal ennui filling in for the graphic oral sex). After the shattering pop breakthrough of 2001s Discovery, Daft Punk were going through an especially angsty adolescence-- their spit-shined heads way up their own asses. But then, amped-up with enough electricity to illuminate a black hole, French houses masked men upstaged Madonna, previous electronic pioneers Depeche Mode, and (ironically) Kanye West at 2006s Coachella. And now, theyre everywhere (except Gap ads, thankfully)-- getting sampled on no. 1 hip-hop songs, filling magazine spreads, spawning worthy would-be successors and, of course, owning the internet (on Flickr, Daft Punk photos currently outnumber Justin Timberlake snaps 2:1). With a bounty of latent good will on their side thanks to the incredible re-playability of their first two albums, Daft Punk finally gave fans a million flashing reasons to fall in love with them all over again.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Alive 2007 is how well it recontextualizes career nadir Human After All, turning previously leaden songs into ebullient rocknroll manifestos; injected with Homeworks air-tight Moroder-style anthems or Discoverys flamboyant funk, Human After All tracks are constantly improved and born anew. The live set doesnt simply run through the hits, mindlessly segueing from one smash to another. Instead, well-worn favorites are glued together, cut-up and mashed into pieces. The titular refrains of \"Television Rules the Nation\" and \"Around the World\" combine to form the globes most dance-friendly TV station theme song before the Black Sabbath crunch of \"Television\" is sent down upon the impossibly buoyant \"Crescendolls\", resulting in the discs most unlikely-yet-spectacular roller coaster peak. Meanwhile, the creepy hiss of \"Steam Machine\" is atomized and given space-age dynamics, turning it from a oddball bore into a fist-pumping celebration of the industrial age. Wisely, the duo also know when to let the bass be, allowing large portions of unfuckwithable classics like \"Da Funk\" and \"Burnin\" to work their magic with little robo-meddling. Even without video, Alive 2007 is an exercise in exacting excess, from the blaring \"Robot Rock\" intro to a wide-eyed power-booster of a encore that layers \"One More Time\" atop \"Music Sounds Better With You\"-- a combination so \"holy shit\" ecstatic it would seem downright cocky if it wasnt so blissful.\nTalking about the relationship between artist and audience, Bangalter told Paper, \"Robots dont make people feel like theres an idol on stage. Its more like a rave party where the DJ isnt important. We are two robots in this pyramid with this light show, but everything is [meant] for you to have fun and enjoy yourself.\" Hes absolutely right about the \"have fun and enjoy yourself\" bit, but the Alive tour separated itself from the millions of DJ parties before it by drawing attention to a fixed point while incorporating everything from KISS-esque pomp to Space Invaders retro-future shock. The results were massive-- the myriad \"best show ever\" kudos deserved. And, just as they hold back their identities at every chance, it makes sense for Daft Punk to hold back the Alive visuals; when more and more mystery is constantly being sucked out of popular music thanks to the insatiable hunger for fresh product and up-to-the-nanosecond information, the duo arent about to release an imagination-stifling DVD filled with behind-the-scenes tour bus inanity. Its a noble choice, especially when the consolation prize happens to be the Ultimate Daft Punk Mixtape.",

The albums cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncles knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamars baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rappers inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the albums calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamars childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. \nLamar has subtitled the record \"A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar\", and the comparison rings true: You could take the albums outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick \"with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental,\" driving his mothers van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: \"Its deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb,\" he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the albums structure: Kendricks mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this albums world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.\nAll this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when \"Backseat Freestyle\" leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter (\"All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower\") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendricks character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his \"damn, I got bitches\" chant gets turned inside out: This isnt an alpha males boast. Its a pipsqueaks first pass at a chest-puff. Its also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat.\nLamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this albums edges, casting shadows on Kendricks complicated relationship with his hometown. When \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, cause I was a high-school grad...\"), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: \"I made a promise to see you bleeding,\" he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Comptons Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, \"Wake yo punk ass up,\" like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.\nWhich brings us to the albums most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendricks rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamars story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample (\"Poetic Justice\") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dres appearance, on the final track \"Compton\", that feels like an uneasy outlier.\n\"Compton\" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement \"Sing About Me, Im Dying of Thirst\", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the albums most dazzling stroke of empathy, it cant help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artists story is always less interesting than their journey, and theres a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blazes blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dres music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it.\nBut the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, \"Real\", which represents the spiritual victory that the albums story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that \"none of that shit\"-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- \"make me real,\" Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the albums central concerns to bed: \"Any nigga can kill a man,\" his father admonishes. \"That dont make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family.\" And his mother: \"If I dont hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And thats the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.\"",

        "article_text": "The stylization of the name tUnE-yArDs in print is a bit off-putting, but it at least gives people fair warning: This is not an act with any interest in politely conforming to expectations. tUnE-yArDs is the music project of Merrill Garbus, a songwriter, vocalist, percussionist, and ukulele player who has fused elements of acoustic folk, R\u0026B, funk, Afro-pop, and rock into a bold, uncompromising hybrid all her own. Garbus is blessed with an extraordinary voice, and she wields it with great confidence, always coming off in total control of her phrasing while seeming totally uninhibited in her expression. Theres an authoritative quality to her voice-- she often sings with a commanding, full-bodied boldness, but even at her softest, Garbus sounds assertive and forthright.\nw h o k i l l, Garbus second album as tUnE-yArDs, delivers on the promise of her 2009 debut, BiRd-BrAiNs. Unlike that album, which she recorded almost entirely on her own using a digital voice recorder and the sound editing program Audacity, w h o k i l l was mostly made in traditional studios in collaboration with bassist Nate Brenner, engineer Eli Crews, and a handful of other musicians. The music benefits from the increased professionalism, but Garbus has not abandoned her lo-fi aesthetic. As on BiRd-BrAiNs, Garbus layers sound to create a patchwork of contrasting textures. This time around, the greater clarity allows for more exaggerated dynamics. This is most apparent in \"Gangsta\", a carefully arranged track that evokes danger and fear with bluntly abbreviated blasts of horn noise and sounds that cut in and out erratically like a set of headphones with a busted wire or a cell phone that cant hold its signal. On the opposite end of the spectrum, she creates an almost unsettling intimacy on \"Wooly Wolly Gong\" by mixing the ambient hum of room sound with closely micd arpeggiated chords and vocals.\nBrenners presence on bass is the biggest difference between w h o k i l l and BiRd-BrAiNs. His style is loose and jazzy, with fluid, melodic lines that add dimension to Garbus compositions. She sounded so isolated on BiRd-BrAiNs, but suddenly her music is like a conversation, with Brenners parts bouncing off her voice and rhythms like thoughtful banter. He brings a janky funk to \"Es-so\", a zippy groove to \"Bizness\", and a delicate weight to the airy \"Doorstep\". On \"Powa\", his lead lines slink around Garbus slo-mo rock riff as if in a subliminal duet with her expressive vocal performance. That song builds steadily over the course of five minutes until it reaches a stunning climax in which Brenners bass bounces gently as Garbus hits a glorious high note like a feral Mariah Carey.\nThroughout w h o k i l l, Garbus confronts thorny issues of race, gender, body image, and privilege in ways that are pointed but nuanced. She mostly sticks to personal narratives, suggesting big ideas and complex tensions in her subtext while emphasizing the urgency of small moments and concrete details. Shes most direct in the opening cut \"My Country\", in which she wrestles with guilt over her own privilege, but shes more thought-provoking when in murkier, more ambiguous territory, like when she sings about a sexual fantasy involving the brutal cop who arrested her brother in \"Riotriot\" or when she wonders aloud why she does not have more black male friends at the end of \"Killa\". Garbus is particularly fascinated by violence; most of the tracks on w h o k i l l deal with power struggles that arise from inequity and lead to further cruelty and injustice. Her lighter moments are still quite complicated-- she playfully wrestles with negative body image in \"Es-so\", while that same lingering disgust and self-doubt brings a moving subtext to \"Powa\", an ode to a lover who can get her to momentarily let go of stress and insecurities.\nBack in 1983 Sonic Youths Kim Gordon wrote an essay for Art Forum that suggested that when we go to rock performances, we pay to see other people believe in themselves. A lot of what makes w h o k i l l and tUnE-yArDs excellent live performances so compelling is the degree to which Garbus commits to her ideas and displays a total conviction in her personal, idiosyncratic, high-stakes music. This, in and of itself, is very inspiring and empowering. This unguarded, individualistic expression encourages strong identification in listeners, so dont be surprised if this record earns Garbus a very earnest and intense cult following.",

        "article_text": "FKA twigs knows a thing or two about creating an image for herself. Every song shes released so far, even the four from her self-released debut EP from 2012, has been accompanied by its own video. What these may lack in storyboarding, set design, or anything else, really—\"Hide\" just features her hypnotically stroking an anthurium that adorns her nude midsection—more than make up for in their ability to draw you close, hold you rapt and keep you wondering just who, exactly, this character called twigs might be. \nThe British musician and performer born Tahliah Barnett got her start in the pop-industrial complex as a backup dancer in music videos, a career that led, for a spell, to a strange kind of almost-fame—you walk around and you get recognized, but not for being you, necessarily, just for being that girl from the video. And so, she has said, you learn to lie: \"No, thats not me. No, I get that a lot.\" She addresses this situation on her debut album, LP1, with the song \"Video Girl\". Its actually one of the albums most straightforward songs, but its chorus is unequivocal in its equivocations: \"Is she the girl thats from the video?/ You lie and you lie and you lie.\"  And all that artifice, in turn, is a way of making truth out of the lie. Because what is her music, what are her videos, if not an elaborate way of saying, \"No, Im not that girl from the video. This is who I am\"?\nShe hides in plain sight on the cover of LP1, wearing an expression thats—what? Coy? Distant? What exactly is going on there, beneath those strands of just-so curlicue and that weird, plastic sheen across one slick cheek? And that splash of red, what is that supposed to be—a blush, a bruise, a birthmark? Is she a teenybopper post-popped bubblegum, a cartoon character post-exploding cigar? The image expands upon the subtle surrealism of last years EP2 cover, where her neck was almost imperceptibly elongated, and the more aggressive post-processing of her \"Water Me\" video, in which her eyes are enlarged, anime-style, until they threaten to pop like a Panic Pete Squeeze Toy. These tweaks are crucial to twigs eerie, post-humanist, Uncanny Valley-girl aesthetic.\nMore than anything else, the image reminds me of Björks Alexander McQueen-designed Homogenic cover, in which the Icelandic singer hovered in the middle distance between larger-than-life pop icon and superflat fantasy gloss like a digital scan of a wax figure. Listening to LP1, its immediately clear that twigs is aiming for similar heights—and easily capable of scaling them. Quiet as it may be, this is a huge album, a monumental debut. On a formal level, it takes the kinds of risks that few pop artists, and few \"experimental\" artists, for that matter, are willing to take these days. As far as the making of the artist known as FKA twigs goes, it gives us a sense of who she is without shedding any of the mystique she has developed so far.\nBuilding on her co-produced debut EP with Tic and her Arca-produced EP2, the sound throughout is a crystalline jumble of splinters and shards, of stuttering drum machines cutting against arrhythmic clatter—metronomes winding down, car alarms bleating dully into the night. Her voice, the most awe-inspiring instrument on the album, flits between Auto-Tuned artifice and raw carnality. As an acrobat, shes a natural, but shes not afraid to lean on a little digital enhancement. One minute its a flash-frozen sigh; the next, its a melon-balled dollop of flesh. As futuristic as her music is, no single technology dominates. Elastic digital effects brush up against 808s, and icy synth stabs share space with acoustic bass. The common denominator is the crackling sense of dread that persists when the notes go silent and the beat drops out, which is often. The overall effect is that of R\u0026B that has been run through some kind of matter-transporting beam and put together wrong on the other end, full of glitches and hard, jutting artifacts.\nThe most obvious reference points, aside from the spectrum of breathy, synth-heavy R\u0026B that stretches from Ciara through the Weeknd and Beyoncé, are first-gen trip-hop acts like Portishead and Tricky, with their charcoal-streaked affect and sumptuous sense of texture. There are also clear links to contemporary UK artists working the margins between R\u0026B and electronic music, like James Blake, the xx, and even Sophie, he of the deconstructed Saturday-morning rave choons. Her own vocal style, or at least her stratospheric range, evokes Kate Bush and even Tori Amos. More provocative, though, is the way she and her producers wrangle a whole host of unlikely references into the mix: \"Two Weeks\" features blushing chords reminiscent of late Cocteau Twins and a junkyard guitar lead straight out of Tom Waits Rain Dogs. Even more incongruously, \"Two Weeks\" cribs a fleeting riff from Air Supplys \"All Out of Love.\" \nAt the same time, its a testament to the strength of her vision that the album is as cohesive as it is, despite having so many producers involved, including Arca, Devonté Hynes, Clams Casino, and Grammy-winning journeyman Emile Haynie (Eminems Recovery, Lana Del Reys \"Born to Die\" and \"Blue Jeans,\" Kanye Wests \"Runaway\"). Sampha helps out on the brittle \"Numbers,\" a Portishead-gone-footwork number that serves as the albums energetic peak, and, perhaps most surprisingly, Paul Epworth (Adele, Coldplay, the Rapture) is responsible for \"Pendulum,\" the albums literal and emotional centerpiece. \nFKA twigs is not a masterful lyricist, at least not yet; some of her couplets feel clunky, like shes grasping in the dark for rhymes and coming up with the objects closest to hand (\"If the flame gets blown out and you shine/ I will know that you cannot be mine\"). But when she zeroes in on the essence of a thing, she hits hard. The brazen \"Two Weeks\" features lines as vivid as red welts: \"Higher than a motherfucker\", \"I can fuck you better than her.\" (The Weeknd only wishes he could make depravity sound so soul-destroyingly desperate.) On top of that, theres a whole thing about pulling out teeth that tips the song into some kind of freaky David Cronenberg territory, making her drugged-up and tied-down fantasies all the more tantalizingly surreal. \nIf \"Two Weeks\" represents the albums sensual core, \"Pendulum\" is the epicenter of the records underlying sense of heartbreak, with its glum mantra, \"So lonely trying to be yours.\" Lyrically, the song finds twigs at her most plainspoken—its a long way off from last years similarly devastating, but far more cryptic, \"Water Me\"—so it feels significant that its one of the albums most sonically out-there songs, with a rhythm built out of what sounds like a roulette wheel run amok and its wash of synthesizers like a sky full of fireflies in death spirals. \nEarly in the song, she sings, \"Lately Im not so present now,\" and the line goes straight to the crux of FKA twigs whole identity. After all, this is an artist whose name itself suggests a fundamental displacement. Spelled out, its \"Formerly Known As twigs,\" (no) thanks to the lawyers of some other artist named Twigs. (Barnett earned her nickname from her habit of cracking her joints like dried sticks; is it any wonder her beats are so brittle?) That \"FKA\" is a way of masking the bigger question mark. Formerly known as, sure. But who is she now? Are you that girl from the video? \"I cant recognize me,\" she sings at the close of \"Video Girl\", but for the rest of us, with LP1, shes zooming into vivid focus, and its impossible to look away.",

        "article_text": "Nearly 40 years on from their initial, unceremonious flameout, the Stooges have been thoroughly absorbed and accepted into the pop-cultural mainstream in ways that wouldve seemed nigh unimaginable in the early 1970s. Beyond blazing the trail for punk and the subgenres that arose in its wake, their songs have been covered by stadium-rock giants, featured in videogames, successfully mashed-up with Salt N Pepa, soundtracked Kristen Stewart/Dakota Fanning make-out scenes in big-screen biopics, and used to sell Chryslers. But its no coincidence that all of these middlebrow appropriations draw from the bands 1969 self-titled debut and 1973s Raw Power-- by Stooges standards, the albums youre most likely to reach for when entertaining house guests.\nThe bands infamous 1970 sophomore release, Fun House, has remained largely undisturbed by the music supervisors of the world, because, as even casual Stooges fans know, you just dont fuck with Fun House. It isnt simply a collection of classic proto-punk songs, its a very real, physical, suffocating space. Its an album in which you get locked and trapped, and from which you reemerge a different person. Over the course of its 36 minutes, Iggy Pops temperament is gradually debased from the cocksure swagger of opener \"Down on the Street\" to the screaming, strait-jacketed psychosis of the closing \"L.A. Blues\". Its an album that even one of the most absurdly over-the-top box sets in rock history couldnt decode or demystify. \nBut if Fun House is like that creepy dilapidated domicile at the end of the street, the Ty Segall Band are the neighborhood punks who break into it late at night just for kicks, spray paint the walls, and leave behind a small mountain of empty beer cans. Now, the Ty Segall Band are not the Stooges; their full-throttle, pedal-squashing thrust makes no allowances for the Stooges underrated sense of groove and funk, and Segall is way more of a sucker for pop melody than Iggy ever was. But Slaughterhouse sees them redrafting the Fun House floor plan for their own devious devices: theres that evocative title, for one, and the fact that both albums end with extended, free-form noise meltdowns (in Segalls case, the self-explanatory \"Fuzz War\"). But most of all, theyve vividly captured Fun Houses unapologetic griminess, blast-furnace heat, and panic attack-inducing lack of oxygen.\nSlaughterhouse is also the closest thing to a concept album weve heard from Segall, whose reputation has been built upon on a ceaseless stream of releases born of a hyperactive whimsy. And where the Lennon-like turns on 2011s Drag City debut, Goodbye Bread, suggested Segall was following a similar pop-leaning path to garage-reared peers like Smith Westerns, Black Lips, and the late Jay Reatard, it was answered earlier this year by a wiggy, scatterbrained collaboration with psych-folkie White Fence. But on Slaughterhouse, Segalls impulsiveness yields to a holistic aesthetic. Segall has described it as \"evil space rock\" in interviews, but Slaughterhouse feels more subterranean and animalistic than that descriptor suggests. This is an album that opens with a scorching double-shot of Motor City-burning rave-ups (\"Death\" and \"I Bought My Eyes\") and a title track that recalls Nirvana with a serious case of Tourettes, and then just gets faster, heavier, and nastier as it progresses; even the withering mid-album sludgefeast \"Wave Goodbye\" eventually intensifies into a fiercely militaristic, machine-gunned finale. (Only a crazed, abruptly terminated cover of the Bo Diddley/Captain Beefheart standard \"Diddy Wah Diddy\"-- which ends with Segall screaming \"fuck this fucking song!\" before admitting with a laugh, \"I dont know what were doing!\"-- breaks the albums sinister spell.)\nRemarkably, Slaughterhouses extra heft doesnt come at the expense of Segalls melodic gifts and Nuggets-schooled economy. Its one thing to be heavy, and its another thing to be hooky, but Slaughterhouse is the rare garage-rock album to do both so well simultaneously: the hopped-up harmonies of \"Tell Me Whats Inside Your Heart\" sound like Hamburg-era Beatles on a particularly potent amphetamines binge, and even the sewer-soaked cover of the Fred Neil-via-The Fabs oldie \"Thats the Bag Im In\" cant obscure its righteous chorus. But Slaughterhouses surprising bounty of crust-covered pop hooks doesnt so much temper the albums ferocious attack as adrenalize the Ty Segall Bands performances to lightning-fast, bloodletting extremes. Which makes the aforementioned \"Fuzz War\" the only logical way to bring the albums careening momentum to a halt. Comprising 10 minutes of ominous feedback drones and hailstorm drum rattles, the colossal closer proves to be less guitar-carnage climax than scorched-earth aftermath, an opportunity to tally up the body count and mop up the entrails. But while \"Fuzz War\" may be an uncharacteristic moment of excess on another otherwise lean and mean album, it reinforces the idea of Slaughterhouse as a real place to get lost in-- and the only way out is through the killing floor.",

        "article_text": "In Dennis Coopers 1987 novel Closer, young George Miles gets totally fucked. Poor kid probably just wants to be loved-- either that or trip out on acid and live in Disneyland, whichever is more realistic-- but he falls prey to charlatans of all stripes. Old-fart perverts deface his flesh with loveless sexual violence. \"Do you know whats inside that cute body of yours?\" one asks, then comes brutally close to exposing the answers.\nAtlanta five-piece Deerhunter, who hailed Cooper as a primary influence in a recent Dusted feature, show their guts admirably on this vast, visceral second album. Arranged in chronological sequence from two distinct recording sessions, Cryptograms is alternately murky and ethereal, amorphous and incisive, shot through with Sonic Youth guitar squall, Spacemen 3s blissful hymns, the morbidly introspective drum sounds of early Factory Records productions, and the abstract sonic richness of Harold Budds collaborations with Brian Eno.\nThe albums willfully cryptic first half opens with a psych-out, both musically and mentally. Out of a nature scenes tranquility, a foreboding bassline and bird-calling keyboards summon singer Bradford Cox, who kicks off the galvanizing title track with a declaration of regret: \"My greatest fear/ I fantasized/ The days were long/ The weeks flew by/ Before I knew/ I was awake/ My days were through/ It was too... late.\" As the song careens toward an increasingly chaotic climax, Cox finds his senses deteriorating until the final, indefinite repetition of the closing mantra: \"There was no sound.\" Underpinned by Josh Fauvers primal bass and Moses Archuletas paranoid drums, the similarly bleak \"Lake Somerset\" is a scream-saturated stomper with largely obscured lyrics about murder and pissing. No wonder Cox endured daily panic attacks throughout its recording.\n\"The skinniest man on the face of the Earth,\" claim the MySpacers. \"He suffers from Marfan syndrome, try not to insult him,\" others retort. The 1 in 5,000 Americans affected are typically tall, thin, and at risk of heart problems. Source(s): MySpace, March of Dimes.\nDeerhunter arent content just to put their least welcoming side forward. Cryptograms also intersperses its loosely structured songs with a handful of extended, largely instrumental ambient passages. Guitarists Colin Mee and Lockett Pundt know their delay pedals-- the drifting chords on \"White Ink\" ring with the same washed-out analog shimmer that made Flying Saucer Attacks Further so powerfully nostalgic, gradually filling in with low end as keyboards and vocal effects add layers of texture off in the distance. The dream-like \"Providence\", written on a Rhode Island tour stop with Lightning Bolt, sounds at once radiant and terrified. \"Octet\" finds Coxs cries muffled behind the maelstrom, until the drums and bass lock together in the second half, erupting in a static-drenched propulsion that doesnt let up until a busy-signal organ tone segues into the droning, bell-swathed \"Red Ink\". The albums first half concludes with the tape to which the band recorded literally spinning off its reel.\n\"She said, Dream dreams the dreamer/ I said its not my fault.\" An earlier recording session was scrapped for, among other reasons, a poorly calibrated tape machine. At least one song here was written after several Ambien. Deerhunters original bass player died in a tragic skateboarding accident; hed just gotten clean. Source(s): Television, Bradford Cox.\nThat first 30 minutes of Cryptograms is a slow but steady build towards the vastly more accessible latter half, recorded several months after the first. Opening with the perpetual climax of \"Spring Hall Convert\", these songs depict a Deerhunter reborn-- if not happy, then at least comfortably numb. Here, all that brooding sludge-psych and those airy backgrounds give way to swooning dream-pop and comparatively lucid songwriting: \"Strange Lights\" is the first track on Cryptograms with clearly decipherable lyrics, Cox waxing childlike about \"walking to the sun,\" bathed in bright, lambent guitars. The gauzy growing-up reminiscence \"Hazel St.\" asks for protection in pop-glorified sunlight; portentous finale \"Heatherwood\", with its ramshackle percussion, promises another reincarnation. \"Was not seen again,\" several voices repeat, ending not with a bang but with an enigmatic whistle.\nThe Deer Hunter is a movie. \"Deer Hunter\" is a game. Deerhunter are a band that sometimes gets called Deer Hunter. Deerhoof are somebody else. Source(s): Twenty-five years on Earth, Google.\nOf course, even the second recording sessions highly melodic space-outs arent fully coherent. As Cox laments in \"Hazel St.\", \"The subject is always just out of frame.\" At this point, with an album called Cryptograms, youre weird if you havent been wondering what, exactly, the encoded message might be-- if, in fact, there is one at all. I like to think its that Deerhunter are a pop band.\nAfter all, while Cryptograms presents its own obstacles, its easily enjoyed as a whole. Memorable melodies and an awkward, charismatic narrator are often peeking from behind the dissonance-laden mists that self-consciously choke them. From The Velvet Underground \u0026 Nico to Sid and Nancy, the sweetest romance of the rock undergrounds life was always death. And the tragic beauty of Cryptograms, as to an extent with Coopers novels, is the way something as innocent as pop can be so mercilessly corrupted-- and due to the ensuing tension, emerge as better art for it.",

        "article_text": "Madvillainy, one of the most anticipated releases in underground rap history, happens to parallel one of the most anticipated arrivals in comic book history: the short-lived Amalgam Comics label. As the name implied, the Amalgam Universe brought together the two most dominant and popular comic factions-- Marvel and DC-- and all of their respective characters, styles and quirks. The long-awaited collaboration between producer/emcees Madlib and MF Doom, Madvillainy is the Infinity Gauntlet of rap, a tense mainstream-meets-indie, avant-meets-antique melee that, as the opening sample suggests, plays on a \"seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings.\"\n\"MADVILLAIN: RETARDED HARD COPY\"\nIn November 2002, Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib) went south to Brazil on business. For the trip, he compiled two mix CDs of beats and unfinished tracks: one stored his collaborations with Detroits Jay Dee; the second held work with Brooklyns Daniel Dumile (aka MF Doom). As a true testament to both fidelitys fragility and the power of file-sharing, both discs leaked a few months later, giving birth to a logical buzz, but more importantly, heightening expectations to impossible heights; these demos were pretty fucking tight. If \"Peeyano Keys\" and \"Powerball #5\" were just rough drafts, what could be expected of the completed project?\nUndoubtedly, Madlib and Doom felt the pressure. The leak seemed to be a huge kick in the ass, especially for Madlib, who in the past few years has been garnering the reputation of being brilliant and prolific, but distracted: His Blunted in the Bomb Shelter mix (rumored to have been concocted in less than a day), Blue Note-sampling Shades of Blue, and even the Jaylib collaboration are fresh, but sloppy and often unfocused. Madvillainy is anything but: The samples are smart and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs.\n\"Wild guess, you can say he stay sedated.\"\nOne of the noticeable differences between the unauthorized promo and the final burn of the album is a change in vocal tone from Doom, which has shifting from an excited, measured performance to a slower, scratchier and ultimately better-suited delivery, considering Madlibs low-key, bass-oriented production. Some people take the new chilled delivery as somehow inferior to the old incarnation, but taken in context, the album benefits from the re-recording, particularly in cases were Doom re-arranges couplets to optimize his punchlines (\"Meat Grinder\") or adds new lines altogether (\"Figaro\").\n\"Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion.\"\nDooms acknowledgement of Madlibs accordion sample (the same one Daedelus used on 2002s Invention) is the most obvious instance of Madvillainys lyrics/production integrity, but the album is chock full of them. For a collaboration which the duo has described as something \"like a telepathy thing. There wasnt a lot of talking,\" Madlib and Doom, proponents of two distinctive hip-hop styles, are of one unusually strong mind.\n\"Mad plays the bass like the race card.\"\nThe axis of Madvillainy is Otis Jackson Jr.s production. While Dooms entire career has been shadowed by consistently strong production efforts, never has such chemistry developed between him and another beatmaker. From the unbelievable Castlevania-meets-Rocky \u0026 Bullwinkle piano chase music of \"Supervillain Theme\" to the shifting keyboard jazz suite of \"Great Day\" to the dark chamber bass, timbales and jump-cut ukulele plucks of \"Meat Grinder\", Madlib proves himself as much more than just a loop digger, topping his best work on Quasimotos The Unseen with an album of consistently incredible beat work. And it isnt just the beats that make the partnership work so well: The character of his vocal samples and the smoothness of his song-to-song segues make this album individual to the styles of both artists-- a difference that puts this pairing far ahead of similarly talented teams like Rjd2 and Blueprints Soul Position.\n\"Dont make me have to pound his tin crown face in.\"\nBoth Dooms and Madlibs myriad aliases make sparkling cameo appearances on Madvillainy, most notably on \"Americas Most Blunted\", in which Madlib bickers with alter-ego Quasimoto, and on \"Fancy Clown\", which features Dumile as Viktor Vaughn. Here, Vaughn steams on an ex-girlfriends unfaithfulness-- but shes cheating with Metalface, another Dumile alias. Its a brilliant conceit, and perhaps makes \"Fancy Clown\" hip-hops first schizophrenic self-diss track.\n\"Hey you: Dont touch the mic like its AIDS on it.\"\nOkay, so maybe thats a little harsh. Although the guest appearances from the Stones Throw massive are Jackson Jr.s take on label-based self-aggrandizement, they never disrupt the albums flow, and never say anything too stupid (Medaphoar even garners a laugh on \"Raid\" with, \"My niggas take no like Kobe\"). Still, it helps that these extraneous verses are few and far between; most listeners would likely have preferred an additional Doom cut instead, or at least an appearance from Dooms Monsta Island Czars.\n\"Spit so many verses, sometimes my jaw twitches/ One thing this party could use is more... booze.\"\nWhen much of the underground often aspires to Truth and Something Bigger, Madlib and Doom have always seemed content to be quirky through and through, lightly roasting themselves and subverting the genre itself to brilliant effect. Like in the above quote from \"Great Day\": The rhymes pattern and raps topical stereotype demands the word \"bitches,\" yet Doom hilariously says \"booze\" instead. Or on \"Money Folder\", in which Doom starts off, \"Dont mind me, I wont just rhyme lightly off of two or three Heinies,\" but flips beers to babes midway: \"And boy was they fine, G: One black, one Spanish, one Chi-nee.\"\n\"The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard.\"\nMadvillainy is inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of carefully considered yet immediate hip-hop, forward-thinking but always close to its roots. Madlib and Doom are individually at their most refined here, and together, theyve created one of the most exciting blockbuster alliances in the underground to date. Good luck finding a better hip-hop album this year, mainstream, undie, or otherwise.\n ",

        "article_text": "Like many music lovers of a certain age, I have a lot of warm memories tied up with release days. I miss the simple ritual of making time to buy a record. I also miss listening to something special for the first time and imagining, against reason, the rest of the world holed up in their respective bedrooms, having the same experience. Before last Wednesday, I cant remember the last time I had that feeling. I also cant remember the last time I woke up voluntarily at 6 a.m. either, but like hundreds of thousands of other people around the world, there I was, sat at my computer, headphones on, groggy, but awake, and hitting play.\nSuch a return to communal exchange isnt something youd expect to be orchestrated by a band whos wrung beauty from alienation for more than a decade. But if the past few weeks have taught us anything, its that Radiohead revel, above all else, in playing against type. Its written in their discography; excluding the conjoined twins that were Kid A and Amnesiac, each of their albums constitutes a heroic effort to debunk those that came before it. Although 2003s Hail to the Thief was overlong and scattershot, it was important insofar as it represented the full bands full-circle digestion and synthesis of the sounds and methods they first toyed with on OK Computer. So, after a decade of progression, where do we go from here?\nIf the 2006 live renditions of their new material were anything to go by, not much further. With few exceptions, the roughly 15 songs introduced during last years tour gave the impression that after five searching records, Radiohead had grown tired of trying to outrun themselves. Taken as a whole, the guitar-centric compositions offered a portrait of a band who, whether subconsciously or not, looked conciliatory for the first time in its career. Although a wonderful surprise, their early October album announcement only lent further credence to the theory. Where theyd previously had the confidence to precede albums like OK Computer and Kid A with marketing fanfare worthy of a classic-in-making, this sneak attack felt like a canny strategy to prepare fans for an inevitable downshift.\nThe brilliant In Rainbows represents no such thing. Nonetheless, its a very different kind of Radiohead record. Liberated from their self-imposed pressure to innovate, they sound-- for the first time in ages-- user-friendly; the glacial distance that characterized their previous records melted away by dollops of reverb, strings, and melody. From the inclusion and faithful rendering of longtime fan favorite \"Nude\" to the classic pop string accents on \"Faust Arp\" to the uncharacteristically relaxed \"House of Cards\", Radioheads sudden willingness to embrace their capacity for uncomplicated beauty might be In Rainbows most distinguishing quality, and one of the primary reasons its an improvement on Hail to the Thief.\nNow that singer Thom Yorke has kickstarted a solo career-- providing a separate venue for the solo electronic material he used to shoehorn onto Radiohead albums-- Radiohead also sound like a full band again. Opener \"15 Step\"s mulched-up drum intro represents the albums only dip into Kid A-style electronics; from the moment Jonny Greenwoods zestful guitar line takes over about 40 seconds in, In Rainbows becomes resolutely a five-man show. (For all of Yorkes lonely experimental pieces, its easy to forget how remarkably the band play off each other; the rhythm section of Phil Selway and Colin Greenwood are especially incredible, supplying between them for a goldmine of one-off fills, accents, and runs over the course of the record.) A cut-up in the spirit of \"Airbag\"-- albeit with a jazzier, more fluid guitar line-- \"15 Step\" gives way to \"Bodysnatchers\", which, like much of In Rainbows, eschews verse/chorus/verse structure in favor of a gradual build. Structured around a sludgy riff, it skronks along noisily until about the two-minute mark, when the band veers left with a sudden acoustic interlude. By now, Radiohead are experts at tearing into the fabric of their own songs for added effect, and In Rainbows is awash in those moments.\nThe bands big-hearted resurrection of \"Nude\" follows. The subject of fervent speculation for more than a decade, its keening melodies and immutable prettiness had left it languishing behind Kid As front door. Despite seeming ambivalent about the song even after resurrecting it for last years tour, this album version finds Yorke wrenching as much sweetness out of it as he possibly can, in turn giving us our first indication that hes in generous spirits. Another fan favorite, \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might. \"All I Need\", meanwhile, concludes the albums first side by dressing up what begins as a skeletal rhythm section in cavernous swaths of glockenspiel, synths, pianos, and white noise.\nWith its fingerpicked acoustic guitars and syrupy strings, \"Faust Arp\" begs comparisons to some of the Beatles sweetest two-minute interludes, while the stunning \"Reckoner\" takes care of any lingering doubt about Radioheads softer frame of mind: Once a violent rocker worthy of its title, this version finds Yorkes slinky, elongated falsetto backed by frosty, clanging percussion and a meandering guitar line, onto which the band pile a chorus of backing harmonies, pianos, and-- again-- swooping strings. It may not be the most immediate track on the album, but over the course of several listens, it reveals itself to be among the most woozily beautiful things the band has ever recorded.\nWith its lethargic, chipped-at guitar chords, \"House of Cards\" is a slow, R.E.M.-shaped ballad pulled under by waves of reverbed feedback. While its arguably the one weak link in the albums chain, it provides a perfect lead-in to the spry guitar workout of \"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\". Like \"Bodysnatchers\" and \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" before it, \"Jigsaw\" begins briskly and builds into a breakneck conclusion, this time with Yorke upshifting from low to high register to supply a breathless closing rant.\nFinally, the closer. Another fan favorite, Yorkes solo versions of \"Videotape\" suggested another \"Pyramid Song\" in the making. Given the spirit of In Rainbows, youd be forgiven for assuming its studio counterpart might comprise some sort of epic finale, but to the disappointment of fans, it wasnt to be. Instead, we get a circling piano coda and a bassline that seems to promise a climax that never comes. \"This is one for the good days/ And I have it all here on red, blue, green,\" Yorke sings. Its an affecting sentiment that conjures up images of the lead singer, now a father of two, home filming his kids. A rickety drum beat and shuddering percussions work against the melody, trying clumsily to throw it off, but Yorke sings against it: \"You are my center when I spin away/ Out of control on videotape.\"\nAs the real life drums give way to a barely distinguishable electronic counterpart, Yorke trails off, his piano gently uncoils, and the song ends with a whimper. The whole thing is an extended metaphor, of course, and, this being Radiohead, its heavy-handed in its way, but its also a fitting close to such a human album. In the end, that which we feared came true: In Rainbows represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth. Luckily, as it turns out, thats nothing to be afraid of at all.",

        "article_text": "Its likely that the first time you heard the Arcade Fires monstrously anticipated fourth album Reflektor, you were—to borrow a phrase that Win Butler spits out like a bite of bad food during the records disco-noir title track—\"staring at a screen.\" This past Thursday, the band posted to Youtube an 85-minute video which cued up the entirety of the double-album to visuals from Marcel Camus kaleidoscopic 1959 film Black Orpheus. If something that happens on the internet can be considered An Event, then this certainly was one; in the same moment I saw the bands official tweet announcing it, two people simultaneously instant-messaged me the link. It was late afternoon on the East Coast, lunchtime on the West, and in that moment I did exactly what thousands of other people in those and all other time zones did: Stopped what I was doing, closed some extraneous tabs and programs, and listened. The auto-updating comments became a chronicle of knee-jerk first impressions: fervent gushing (\"The bassline on Joan of Arc is fucking epic\"), groan-worthy puns (\"I cant even reflect how excited this makes me!\"), and egregious misspellings (\"I dont understand what all the fuzz is about\"). This scene would have seemed bizarre—and likely a little sad— to us decades ago, and its frightening to imagine how quaint it will seem in the future. But this is how a lot of people at this moment in time—the one in which Reflektor was made, and the one it distrustfully interrogates—discover new music: Alone; together.\nAll four of the Montreal-based bands albums have been about the tension between those two words, taking up subjects like suburban isolation and the false community of religiosity, but Reflektor is larger, at least in scope, than anything Arcade Fire have done before. Of course, the stakes have been raised considerably since weve last heard from them: Their previous album, The Suburbs, was the unexpected winner of the Grammy for 2011s Album of the Year. And yet, no one involved in this record sounds to be resting on the laurels of their achievements—that includes producer and LCD Soundsystem retiree James Murphy. Reflektor is a triumph, but not a victory lap; the band never sounds content enough for that.\nThis is instead an anxious, occasionally downright paranoid album that asks big, barbed questions aimed not just at the man who may or may not be upstairs, but the more terrestrial gods of rock history, too. With either Ziggy Stardust, the Fly, or maybe that first guy who played Daft Punk to the rock kids as their guide, Arcade Fire have spiked their usual clenched-fist earnestness with a small but welcome pinch of irony—and this is what makes it feel vital in a way that a lot of recent guitar-based music is not. \"Do you like rocknroll music?\" Butler asks in a mock-Elvis shudder at the beginning of glam-rock earthquake \"Normal Person\". \"Cuz I dont know if I do…\" The only way to make a Big Rock Record in 2013 is to make one that is skeptical of what it means to be a Big Rock Record in 2013.\nOn their last tour, the Arcade Fire played for the first time in Haiti, the country where vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Régine Chassagnes parents were born. Their time there served as the inspiration for Reflektor; Butler spoke recently about the experience of playing for audiences whod never heard many of the classic rock groups we take for granted, and instead \"connecting to people on a purely rhythmic, musical level…completely stripped of context.\" You can hear the Caribbean influence in Reflektors emphasis on kinetic rhythms and deep grooves, but also in its somewhat irreverent attitude towards Anglo rock history. Reflektor is at once nostalgic for—its sense of sprawl feels like a throwback to the heyday of AOR—and iconoclastic about the past. It sounds like it has ingested a bunch of the great art-rock records youre \"supposed\" to learn to appreciate in your formative listening years—Low, Remain in Light, Exile on Main Street, The White Album, Here Come the Warm Jets— and thrown them into the fire, in an attempt to make new shapes from the smoke.\nReflektors sound is lush and imaginative, but never in a way that suffocates you with the fumes of its polish. Its limber and loose, as though the songs were performed live; the arrangements breathe, seethe, and sweat. As their detractors will be quick to point out, Arcade Fires greatest crime in the past has been sometimes coming off too stately and self-serious (The Suburbs in particular had a buttoned-up quality that failed to capture the frenzied energy of their live shows), but on the first half of Reflektor they often feel like theyre deflating their own sense of grandeur. Its nice to hear a band that showed up on the scene quite literally dressed for a funeral now sounding like theyre having (at least a little) fun.\nGoofy asides, unexpected left-turns, and tiny imperfections bring these songs to life: Check the odd, muttered phrases scattered throughout the intros, the parts on \"Normal Person\" when Tim Kingsburys high E string seems to get clipped by the fretboard, or, maybe most thrillingly, the tempo fake-outs in \"Here Comes the Night Time\". That song, one of the albums best, begins with a celebratory Carnival beat, but then—the sonic equivalent to the tricks theyve been playing in recent concerts and TV performances—suddenly switches to a slower, dub-inflected pace. Theres a charming scrappiness to that moment as the band reorients to the rhythm, like a marching band suddenly realizing theyre going the wrong way and trying, calamitously, to turn around.Theres always been a physicality about the Arcade Fires sound—were talking, after all, about a band whose members used to find it necessary to wear helmets on stage—but the rhythm section has never popped on one of their albums the way it does here. That emphasis has Murphys stamp all over it (Butler says they all learned an important lesson early in the recording: \"If you can get James tapping his foot, you know youre on the right track\"), and so do the punched-up backing vocals. This is the first Arcade Fire album on which Chassagne doesnt sing lead, but her crisp, smartly arranged harmonies on songs like \"Reflektor\", \"Its Never Over (Oh Orpheus)\", and \"Joan of Arc\" make her a major presence. (Same goes for Colin Stetson, who did the albums horn arrangements and whose uneasy bass sax is the title tracks secret weapon.) Even Reflektors most straightforward pop songs like \"Joan of Arc\" and \"We Exist\" are fractured and haunted, reminiscent of the way Achtung Baby summoned the ghosts that had always been dormant in U2. When people talk about Murphys production on Reflektor, the Eno comparisons will be obvious, unavoidable, and earned.\nReflektor unfolds over two discs, and which you prefer will depend on how many packets of earnest magnificence you take in your Arcade Fire. Disc 1 is raw and grounded; Disc 2 is airier, more cosmic, and a little less self-aware. The records most divisive song is the second halfs centerpiece, \"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\", which—Julie Taymor style—aims to be nothing less than all the Beatles songs at once (\"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution 9\" included). It inevitably falls short, but its hard not to admire the effort. Lyrically if not sonically, the albums weakest link is the slinky \"Porno\", whose heavy-handed lyrics (\"Take the make-up off your eyes…Little boys with their porno/ They dont know what we know\") feel a bit too much like bleeding-heart teenage poetry. And yet, even if the shoulda-been-B-side \"Porno\" feels like a lapse in judgment, it springs from the same source that helps the band continue to be so vital. Arcade Fire are eternal, defiantly emotive teenagers, and thats what kept them sounding like genuine underdogs even as theyve become one of the biggest bands in the world. Nearly a decade after Funeral, Butler still sings like everything is at stake. For this band, growing up has not meant cooling the flames so much as beckoning them higher. The figures at the center of the Side 2 suite of \"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\" and the wonderfully Cocteau-glacial \"Its Never Over (Oh Orpheus)\" are not the Springsteenian everypeople of Funeral and Neon Bible, but instead the star-crossed lovers in a Greek myth.\nAnd yet, even on Disc 2 its hard to shake the feeling that Orpheus and Eurydice are just the B-plot; the great love story on Reflektor is the one between music and listener. With its clipped snippets of airwave chatter (the BBCs Jonathan Ross makes a cameo), warped VHS hum, and retro-luminosity that nods to a time when synthesizers connoted un-jaded wonder and revelation, Reflektor is designed to be an homage to the many ways music is transmitted, discovered, and incorporated into peoples lives. Chassagne has said that her earliest and most stirring musical memories were \"listening to [her] neighbors music, the sounds coming through the walls\" and then trying to replicate them on piano; in the same interview, the Texas-born Butler spoke similarly about U2s (much maligned) Pop Mart tour. Reflektors scope is vast enough that it speaks to both of these experiences—and to our own. In the end, it doesnt feel like a critique of this screen-glazed moment so much as a validation of it. Theyve given us something in the present tense that, these days, feels depressingly unfashionable: An Event—an album that dares to be great, and remarkably succeeds.",
